scenario with the most conservative assumption of adiabatic Gaussian
fluctuations. The mass spectrum of small-scale clumps with M<10^3Msun is
calculated with tidal destruction of the clumps taken into account within the
hierarchical model of clump structure. Only 0.1-0.5% of small clumps survive
the stage of tidal destruction in each logarithmic mass interval. The mass
distribution of clumps has a cutoff at Mmin due to diffusion of DM particles
out of a fluctuation and free streaming at later stage. Mmin is a model
dependent quantity. In the case the neutralino DM, considered as a pure bino,
Mmin~10^-8 Msun. The evolution of density profile in a DM clump does not result
in the singularity because of formation of the core under influence of tidal
interaction. The radius of the core is ~0.1R, where R is radius of the clump.
The applications for annihilation of DM particles in the Galactic halo are
studied. The number density of clumps as a function of their mass, radius and
distance to the Galactic center is presented. The enhancement of annihilation
signal due to clumpiness, valid for arbitrary DM particles, is calculated. In
spite of small survival probability, the global annihilation signal in most
cases is dominated by clumps, with major contribution given by small clumps.
The enhancement due to large clumps with M>10^6 Msun is very small.

self-gravity of the stellar system is the dominant non-Keplerian force, such
systems may be subject to slowly growing (secular) lopsided instabilities.
Stability to secular modes is largely determined by the dependence of the
distribution function F on angular momentum J. If dF/dJ < 0 at constant energy,
all spherical systems are secularly stable. If dF/dJ > 0, as is expected if
there is a loss cone at low angular momentum, all spherical systems in which
F=0 at J=0 (an empty loss cone) are only neutrally stable, and flattened,
non-rotating systems are generally unstable. These results suggest that secular
instabilities may dominate the structure and evolution of the stellar systems

band Chandra spectral fits yield temperatures which are significantly hotter
than those from XMM, but the Fe ionization temperature shows good agreement. We
show that the temperature discrepancy is slightly reduced when comparing
spectra from regions selected to enclose nearly isothermal gas. However, by
simulating multi-temperature spectra and fitting them with a single temperature
model, we find no significant difference between Chandra and XMM, indicating
that non-isothermality cannot fully explain the discrepancy. We have discovered
4 hot spots located between 30--50 kpc from the cluster center, where the gas
temperature is roughly a factor of 2 higher than in the surrounding material.
We estimate the combined excess thermal energy present in these hot spots to be
(3+/-1)x10^59 erg. The location of and amount of excess energy present in the
hot spots are suggestive of a common origin within the cluster core, which
hosts an active galactic nucleus. This cluster also possesses a pair of X-ray
cavities coincident with weak radio lobes, as reported in a previous analysis,
with an associated energy <10% of the thermal excess in the hot spots. The
presence of these hot spots could indicate strong-shock heating of the ICM from
the central radio source -- one of the first such detections in a cool core

microphysics of such shocks are still poorly understood, which, potentially,
can introduce uncertainties in the interpretation of observations. It is now
well established that the Weibel two-stream instability is capable of
generating strong electromagnetic fields in the transition region between the
jet and the ambient plasma. However, the parameter space of collisionless
shocks is vast and still remains unexplored. In this Letter, we focus on how an
ambient magnetic field affects the evolution of the electron Weibel instability
and the associated shock. Using a particle-in-cell code, we have performed
three-dimensional numerical experiments on such shocks. We compare simulations
in which a jet is injected into an unmagnetized plasma with simulations in
which the jet is injected into a plasma with an ambient magnetic field both
parallel and perpendicular to the jet flow. We find that there exists a
threshold of the magnetic field strength below which the Weibel two-stream
instability dominates, and we note that the interstellar medium magnetic field
strength lies well below this value. In the case of a strong magnetic field
parallel to the jet, the Weibel instability is quenched. In the strong
perpendicular case, ambient and jet electrons are strongly accelerated because
of the charge separation between deflected jet electrons and less deflected jet
ions. Also, the electromagnetic topologies become highly non-linear and complex
with the appearance of anti-parallel field configurations.

composed both of old field stars and newly formed ones with each fraction being

with $V_{\rm m}/{\sigma}_{0}$ $\sim$ 2.3. (2) The stellar halo is formed during
the interaction, consisting mainly of old stars originating from the outer part
of the initially thin LMC disk. The outer halo shows velocity dispersion of
$\sim$ 40 km s$^{-1}$ at the distance of 7.5 kpc from the LMC center and has
somewhat inhomogeneous distribution of stars. The stellar halo contains

At variance with previous studies, the shape of our RHLFs is characterized by
the presence of a cut-off at low synchrotron powers which reflects the

constraints on some of the observable properties of the real systems.In this
work we concentrate on the case of the `Titan ringlet of Saturn'.Our approach
is fluid-like, since our description is based on normal modes of oscillation
rather than in individual particle orbits. Thus, the rigid precession of the
ring is described as a global $m=1$ mode, which originates from a standing wave
superposed on an axisymmetric background. An integral balance condition for the
maintenance of the $m=1$ standing-wave can be set up, in which the differential
precession induced by the oblateness of the central planet must cancel the
contributions of self-gravity, the resonant satellite forcing and collisional
effects. We expect that in nearly-circular narrow rings dominated by
self-gravity, the eccentricity varies linearly across the ring. Thus, we take a
first order expansion and we derive two integral relationships from the
rigid-precession condition. These relate the surface density of the ring with
the eccentricity at the center, the eccentricity gradient and the location of
the secular resonance. These relationships are applied to the Titan ringlet of
Saturn, which has a secular resonance with the satellite Titan in which the
ring precession period is close to Titan's orbital period. In this case, we
estimate the mean surface density and the location of the secular resonance.

measuring the Einstein crossing time and the parallax effect on the

self-lensing as one of the models for the interpretation of LMC events, the
maximum shift of image centroids and the parallax parameter are one order of
magnitude smaller than for models with dark halos. This can be used as a test
for the self-lensing, although the shifting of image centroids 0.02 {\it mas},
for the LMC events is unlikely to be observed by the astrometric missions such

entropy $S_q=k (1-\sum_{i=1}^Wp_i^{q}) / (q-1)$ ($q\in \mathcal{R};
S_1=S_{BG}$). Microscopic dynamics determines, given classes of initial
conditions, the occupation of the accessible phase space (or of a
symmetry-determined nonzero-measure part of it), which in turn appears to
determine the entropic form to be used. This occupation might be a uniform one
(the usual {\it equal probability hypothesis} of BG statistical mechanics),
which corresponds to $q=1$; it might be a free-scale occupancy, which appears
to correspond to $q \ne 1$. Since occupancies of phase space more complex than
these are surely possible in both natural and artificial systems, the task of
further generalizing the entropy appears as a desirable one, and has in fact
been already undertaken in the literature. To illustrate the approach, we
introduce here a quite general entropy based on a distribution of $q$-indices
thus generalizing $S_q$. We establish some general mathematical properties for
the new entropic functional and explore some examples. We also exhibit a
procedure for finding, given any entropic functional, the $q$-indices
distribution that produces it. Finally, on the road to establishing a quite
general statistical mechanics, we briefly address possible generalized
constraints under which the present entropy could be extremized, in order to
produce canonical-ensemble-like stationary-state distributions for Hamiltonian
systems.

overlap with a complex, high energy bound state containing an odd number of
composite-fermion quasiparticles. The electron annihilation operator similarly
couples to a bound complex of composite-fermion holes. We predict that these
bound states can be observed through a conductance resonance in experiments

the magnon occupation, using Fermi's golden rule for magnon emission and
absorption and the non-equilibrium electron distribution for a biased spin
valve. The magnon emission reduces the magnetization of the free layer. For
anti-parallel alignment of the magnetizations of the layers and at a critical
bias a magnon avalanche occurs, characterized by a diverging effective magnon
temperature. This critical behavior can result in magnetization reversal and
consequently to suppression of magnon emission. However, magnon-magnon
scattering can lead to saturation of the magnon concentration at a large but
finite value. The further behavior depends on the parameters of the system. In
particular, gradual evolution of the magnon concentration followed by a
magnetization reversal is possible. Another scenario corresponds to a step-like
increase of the magnon concentration followed by a slow decrease. In the latter
case a spike in the differential resistance is expected due to a contribution
of electron-magnon scattering. A comparison of the obtained results to existing
experimental data and theoretical approches is given.

is resonant, exhibiting a maximum when the perturbation frequency coincides
with the natural frequency of the phase oscillators. The individual response,
on the other hand, can strongly depend on the distance to the place where the
perturbation is applied. For small distances on a random network, the system
behaves as a linear dissipative medium: the perturbation propagates at constant
speed, while its amplitude decreases exponentially with the distance. For
larger distances, the response saturates to an almost constant level. These
different regimes can be analytically explained in terms of the length

little in their thermodynamic properties. Nonetheless, recent computer
simulations by Pronk and Frenkel indicate that the elastic response to
mechanical deformation of the two types of crystal should be quite different.
By invoking a geometrical argument put forward by R. Martin some time ago, we
suggest that this is largely due to the different symmetries of the fcc and hcp
crystal structures. Indeed, we find that elastic constants obtained by means of
computer simulations for the fcc hard-sphere crystal can be mapped onto the
equivalent ones of the hcp crystal to very high accuracy. The same procedure
applied to density functional theoretical predictions for the elastic
properties of the fcc hard-sphere crystal also produces remarkably accurate
predictions for those of the hcp hard-sphere crystal.

perturbations, for which the overdensity eventually disperses into the
background medium. For super-critical perturbations, we confirm the results of
previous work concerning scaling-laws but note that the threshold amplitude for
a perturbation to lead to black-hole formation is substantially reduced when
the initial conditions are taken to represent purely growing modes. For
sub-critical cases, where an initial collapse is followed by a subsequent
re-expansion, strong compressions and rarefactions are seen for perturbation
amplitudes near to the threshold. We have also investigated the effect of
including a significant component of vacuum energy and have calculated the
resulting changes in the threshold and in the slope of the scaling law.

fields appreciably at distances of the order of the Compton wavelength. At that
distance the gravitational field becomes spin dominated rather than mass
dominated. The gravitational field couples to the electromagnetic field via the
Einstein-Maxwell equations which in the simplest model causes the electrostatic
field of charged spinning particles to acquire an oblate structure relative to
the spin direction. For electrons and protons, a pure Coulomb field is
therefore likely to be incompatible with general relativity at the Compton
scale. In the simplest model, the magnetic dipole corresponds to the Dirac
g-factor, g=2. Also, it follows from the form of the electric field that the
electric dipole moment vanishes, in agreement with current experimental limits
for the electron. Quantitatively, the classical Einstein-Maxwell theory
predicts the magnetic and electric dipoles of the electron to an accuracy of
about one part in 10^{-3} or better. Going to the next multipole order, one
finds that the first non-vanishing higher multipole is the electric quadrupole
moment which is predicted to be -124 barn for the electron. Any non-zero value
of the electric quadrupole moment for the electron or the proton would be a
clear sign of curvature due to the implied violation of rotation invariance.
There is also a possible spherical modification of the Coulomb force
proportional to r^{-4}. However, the size of this effect is well below current
experimental limits. The corrections to the hydrogen spectrum are expected to
be small but possibly detectable.

drives inflation. We consider a multidimensional potential with a large number

as the system tunnels from the highest energy bowl to another bowl of lower
energy, and so on until it reaches the zero energy ground state. Such a
scenario can be motivated by the many vacua in the stringy landscape, and our
model can apply to other multidimensional potentials. The ''graceful exit''
problem of Old Inflation is resolved since reheating is easily achieved at each
stage. Coupling between the fields is crucial to the scenario. The model is
quite generic and succeeds for natural couplings and parameters. Chain
inflation succeeds for a wide variety of energy scales -- for potentials
ranging from 10MeV scale inflation to $10^{16}$ GeV scale inflation.

constraints unexplained by the Standard Model of particle physics, is

in time between pure gauge field configurations at the far past and future
associated with integer-charged bare quarks, named prequarks. This transition
conforms to a topologically nontrivial configuration of the weak gauge fields

that an effective topological charge equal to the ratio between baryon number

description of physical processes with real eigenvalues which has been
challenged notably by Carl Bender, is examined for the case of a Fock space
Hamilitonian which is bilinear in two creation and destruction operators. An
interpretation of this model as a Schr\""odinger operator leads to an
identification of the Hermitian form of the Hamiltonian as the Landau model of
a charged particle in a plane, interacting with a constant magnetic field at
right angles to the plane. When the parameters of the Hamiltonian are suitably
adjusted to make it non-Hermitian, the model represents two harmonic
oscillators at right angles interacting with a constant magnetic field in the
third direction, but with a pure imaginary coupling, and real energy
eigenvalues. It is now ${\cal PT}$ symmetric. Multiparticle states are
investigated.

wired boundary conditions and are denoted FMSF (free minimal spanning forest)
and WMSF (wired minimal spanning forest), respectively. The WMSF is also the
union of the trees that arise from invasion percolation started at all
vertices. We show that on any Cayley graph where critical percolation has no
infinite clusters, all the component trees in the WMSF have one end a.s. In
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ this was proved by Alexander [Ann. Probab. 23 (1995) 87--104],
but a different method is needed for the nonamenable case. We also prove that
the WMSF components are ``thin'' in a different sense, namely, on any graph,
each component tree in the WMSF has $p_{\mathrm{c}}=1$ a.s., where
$p_{\mathrm{c}}$ denotes the critical probability for having an infinite
cluster in Bernoulli percolation. On the other hand, the FMSF is shown to be
``thick'': on any connected graph, the union of the FMSF and independent
Bernoulli percolation (with arbitrarily small parameter) is a.s. connected. In
conjunction with a recent result of Gaboriau, this implies that in any Cayley
graph, the expected degree of the FMSF is at least the expected degree of the
FSF (the weak limit of uniform spanning trees). We also show that the number of
infinite clusters for Bernoulli($p_{\mathrm{u}}$) percolation is at most the
number of components of the FMSF, where $p_{\mathrm{u}}$ denotes the critical
probability for having a unique infinite cluster. Finally, an example is given
to show that the minimal spanning tree measure does not have negative
associations.

result of this paper involves the enumeration of all $m\times n$ word

$D_2 = C_2\times C_2$ acting on the set of word representations. This
enumeration is achieved by forming a linear combination of four exponential

for on-shell nucleons. These elements are sufficient for the calculation of a
quark core contribution to the nucleons' electromagnetic form factors. An
accurate description of the static properties is not possible with the core
alone but the error is uniformly reduced by the incorporation of meson-loop

nuclear structure of these isotopes is particularly interesting due to the
appearance of a parity-inverted ground state in 11-Be. Our study is performed
in the framework of the ab initio no-core shell model. Results obtained using
four different, high-precision two-nucleon interactions, in model spaces up to
9\hbar\Omega, are shown. For both nuclei, and all potentials, we reach
convergence in the level ordering of positive- and negative-parity spectra
separately. Concerning their relative position, the positive-parity states are
always too high in excitation energy, but a fast drop with respect to the
negative-parity spectrum is observed when the model space is increased. This
behavior is most dramatic for 11-Be. In the largest model space we were able to
reach, the 1/2+ level has dropped down to become either the first or the second
excited state, depending on which interaction we use. We also observe a
contrasting behavior in the convergence patterns for different two-nucleon
potentials, and argue that a three-nucleon interaction is needed to explain the
parity inversion. Furthermore, large-basis calculations of 13-C and 11-B are
performed. This allows us to study the systematics of the position of the first
unnatural-parity state in the N=7 isotone and the A=11 isobar. The 11-B run in

wavefunction $\Psi$ is represented as an antisymmetrised product of overlapping
many-electron group functions, $\Phi_{A}$, corresponding to each part (group)
$A$ of the system: $\Psi=\hat{A}\prod_{A}\Phi_{A}$. For extended (e.g.
infinite) systems the calculation is somewhat difficult, however, as mean

be divided by the normalisation integral $S=<\Psi|\Psi>$, which is given by an
AD expansion as well. A linked AD theorem suggested previously (L. Kantorovich,

reexamined in this paper using a simple Hartree-Fock problem of a

about their direction can be obtained from a pair of anti-parallel spins
compared to a pair of parallel spins, where the first member of the pair (which
we call the pointer member) can point equally along any direction in the Bloch
sphere. They argued that this was due to the difference in dimensionality
spanned by these two alphabets of states. Here we consider similar alphabets,
but with the first spin restricted to a fixed small circle of the Bloch sphere.
In this case, the dimensionality spanned by the anti-parallel versus parallel
alphabet is now equal. However, the anti-parallel alphabet is found to still
contain more information in general. We generalize this to having N parallel
spins and M anti-parallel spins. When the pointer member is restricted to a
small circle these alphabets again span spaces of equal dimension, yet in
general, more directional information can be found for sets with smaller |N-M|
for any fixed total number of spins. We find that the optimal POVMs for
extracting directional information in these cases can always be expressed in
terms of the Fourier basis. Our results show that dimensionality alone cannot
explain the greater information content in anti-parallel combinations of spins
compared to parallel combinations. In addition, we describe an LOCC protocol
which extract optimal directional information when the pointer member is
restricted to a small circle and a pair of parallel spins are supplied.

three dimensions with the initial wave function of a finite-mass atom taken in
the form of a finite-size wave packet. Recoil and wave-packet spreading are
taken into account. The total atom-photon wave function is found in the
momentum and coordinate representations as the solution of an initial-value
problem. The atom-photon entanglement arising in such a process is shown to be
closely related to the structure of atom and photon wave packets which can be
measured in the coincidence and single-particle schemes of measurements. Two
predicted effects, arising under the conditions of high entanglement, are
anomalous narrowing of the coincidence wave packets and, under different
conditions, anomalous broadening of the single-particle wave packets.
Fundamental symmetry relations between the photon and atom single-particle and
coincidence wave packet widths are established. The relationship with the
famous scenario of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen is discussed.

solution exhibits a limit cycle behavior and has infinitely many branches. We
show that a continuous choice for the solution corresponds to a given fixed
number of bound states and to low energy phase shifts that vary continuously
with energy. We study in detail the connection between this regularization
method and a conventional method modifying the short range part of the
potential with an infinitely repulsive hard core. We show that both methods
yield bound states results in close agreement even though the regularization
method of Beane \textit{et al.} does not include explicitly any new scale in
the problem. We further illustrate the use of the regularization method in the
computation of electron bound states in the field of neutral polarizable
molecules without dipole moment. We find the binding energy of s-wave
polarization bound electrons in the field of C$_{60}$ molecules to be 17 meV
for a scattering length corresponding to a hard core radius of the size of the
molecule radius ($\sim 3.37$ \AA). This result can be further compared with
recent two-parameter fits using the Lennard-Jones potential yielding binding
