microns, complemented with HST/UV and optical spectroscopy, of the narrow line
Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk766. The NIR spectrum is characterized by permitted lines
of HI, HeI, HeII and FeII, and forbidden lines of [SII], [SIII] and [FeII]
among others. High ionized species such as [SiIX], [SiX], [SIX] and [MgVII] are
also observed. The continuum has a complex shape, with contribution of the
central engine, circumnuclear stellar population and dust. This last component
is evidenced by the presence of an excess of emission peaking at 2.25 microns,
fitted by blackbody function with T_bb=1200K. That temperature is close to the
evaporation temperature of graphite grains. As such, it provides strong
evidence of hot dust, probably very close to the nucleus. Consistent modeling
of the line and broad band continuum spectrum by composite models, which
account for the photoionizing flux of the central engine and shocks, shows that
the shock velocities are between 100 and 500 km/s, the preshock densities
between 100 and 1000 cm^-3 and the radiation fluxes from the active centre
between 10^9 and 5x10^12 photons cm^-2 s^-1 eV^-1 at 1 Ryd with spectral
indices $\alpha_{UV}$=-1.5 and $\alpha_X$=-0.4. Adopting silicon grains,
dust-to-gas ratios are between 10^-{6} and 4x10$^{-4}$ by mass. The emitting
clouds are at an average distance of 160 pc from the centre, with high velocity
clouds closer and low velocity clouds farther from the centre. The N/H relative
abundance could be twice solar. In constrast, Fe is depleted from the gaseous
phase by a factor >2. Ratios of calculated to observed line ratios to Hbeta
indicate an average contribution of the broad line region to the observed Hbeta
of about 40%.

the Ginzburg-Landau spirit.In this new approach, the precise form of the
inflationary potential is constructed from the present WMAP data, and a useful
scheme is prepared to confront with the forthcoming data. In this approach, the
WMAP statement excluding the pure phi^4 potential implies the presence of an
inflaton mass term at the scale m sim 10^{13}GeV. Chaotic, new and hybrid
inflation is studied in an unified way. In all cases the inflaton potential
takes the form V(phi) = m^2 M_{Pl}^2 v(phi/M_{Pl}), where all coefficients in
the polynomial v(x) are of order one. If such potential corresponds to super
symmetry breaking, the susy breaking scale is sqrt{m M_{Pl}} \sim 10^{16}GeV
which turns to coincide with the GUT scale. The inflaton mass is therefore
given by a see-saw formula m sim M_{GUT}^2/M_{Pl}. The observables turn to be
two valued functions: one branch corresponds to new inflation and the other to
chaotic inflation,the branch point being the pure quadratic potential.For red
tilt spectrum, the potential which fits the best the present data and which
best prepares the way for the forthcoming data is a trinomial polynomial
withnegative quadratic term (new inflation).For blue tilt spectrum, hybrid
inflation turns to be the best choice. In both cases we find a formula relating
the inflaton mass with the ratio r of tensor/scalar perturbations and the
spectral index ns of scalar perturbations: 10^6 m/M_{Pl}= 127 sqrt{r|1-n_s|}
;(the coefficient 127 follows from the WMAP amplitude.Implications for string
theory are discussed.

a very hot neutron star (X-ray burst source). The model equations assume both
hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium, and the equation of state of an ideal
gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The equation of radiative
transfer includes terms describing Compton scattering of photons on free
electrons in fully relativistic thermal motion, for photon energies approaching
m_e *c^2. Model equations take into account many bound-free and free-free
energy-dependent opacities of hydrogen, helium, and the iron ions, and also a
dozen bound-bound opacities for the highest ions of iron. We solve model
equations by partial linearisation and the technique of variable Eddington
factors. Large grid of H-He-Fe model atmospheres of X-ray burst sources has
been computed for 10^7 < T_eff < 3*10^7 K, a wide range of surface gravity, and
various iron abundances. We demonstrate that the spectra of X-ray bursters with
iron present in the accreting matter differ significantly from pure H-He
spectra (published in an earlier paper), and also from blackbody spectra.
Comptonized spectra with significant iron abundance are generally closer to
blackbody spectra than spectra of H-He atmospheres. The ratio of color to
effective temperatures in our grid always remains in the range 1.2 < T_c/T_eff
< 1.85. The present grid of model atmospheres and theoretical X-ray spectra
will be used to determine the effective temperatures, radii and M/R ratios of

to buy or sell in financial markets [2, 19]. We show how this can be caused by
delays in market clearing. Under the common practice of order splitting, large
orders are broken up into pieces and executed incrementally. If the size of
such large orders is power law distributed, this gives rise to power law
decaying autocorrelations in the signs of executed orders. More specifically,
we show that if the cumulative distribution of large orders of volume v is
proportional to v to the power -alpha and the size of executed orders is
constant, the autocorrelation of order signs as a function of the lag tau is
asymptotically proportional to tau to the power -(alpha - 1). This is a
long-memory process when alpha < 2. With a few caveats, this gives a good match
to the data. A version of the model also shows long-memory fluctuations in
order execution rates, which may be relevant for explaining the long-memory of
price diffusion rates.

temperature, focusing on a parameter region with staggered flux (SF)/d-density
wave (DDW) order. To guide our numerical calculations, we first investigate the
location of a SF/DDW phase in the phase diagram of the half-filled weakly
interacting ladder using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) and
bosonization approach. For hole doping delta away from half-filling,
finite-size density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) calculations are used
to study ladders with up to 200 rungs for intermediate-strength interactions.
In the doped SF/DDW phase, the staggered rung current and the rung electron
density both show periodic spatial oscillations, with characteristic
wavelengths 2/delta and 1/delta, respectively, corresponding to ordering
wavevectors 2k_F and 4k_F for the currents and densities, where 2k_F =
pi(1-delta). The density minima are located at the anti-phase domain walls of
the staggered current. For sufficiently large dopings, SF/DDW order is
suppressed. The rung density modulation also exists in neighboring phases where
currents decay exponentially. We show that most of the DMRG results can be
qualitatively understood from weak-coupling RG/bosonization arguments. However,
while these arguments seem to suggest a crossover from non-decaying
correlations to power-law decay at a length scale of order 1/delta, the DMRG
results are consistent with a true long-range order scenario for the currents
and densities.

carbon-free (< 200 ppm) samples were prepared from a vacuum-treated precursor
by sintered at 900 &#730;C and cooling with 20 &#730;C /min in flowing oxygen
gas. The lower Tc (= 88 K) and higher oxygen content (y = 6.98) strongly
suggested the overdoping state, which was supported by the temperature
dependence of resisitivity and thermoelectric power. The nuclear quadrapole
resonance spectra and the Raman scattering spectra indicated that there was
almost no oxygen defect in the Cu-O chain in these samples. On the other hand,
in the same cooling condition, the samples sintered in air stayed at optimal
doping level with Tc = 93 K, and the intentionally carbon-doped sample was in
the underdoping state. It is revealed that about 60% of incorporated carbon was
substituted for Cu at the chain site in the form of CO32+, and the rest remains
at the grain boundary as carbonate impurities. Such incorporation affected the
oxygen absorption process in Y-123. It turned out that the oxygen content in
Y-123 cannot be controlled only by the annealing temperature and the oxygen
partial pressure but also by the incorporated carbon concentration.

metallic plutonium in both phases in agreement with experiment a nonmagnetic
ground state was found with Pu ions in f^6 configuration with zero values of
spin, orbital, and total moments. This result is determined by a strong
spin-orbit coupling in 5f shell that gives in LDA calculation a pronounced
splitting of 5f states on f^{5/2} and f^{7/2} subbands. A Fermi level is in a
pseudogap between them, so that f^{5/2} subshell is already nearly completely
filled with six electrons before Coulomb correlation effects were taken into
account. The competition between spin-orbit coupling and exchange (Hund)
interaction (favoring magnetic ground state) in 5f shell is so delicately
balanced, that a small increase (less than 15%) of exchange interaction
parameter value from J_H=0.48eV obtained in constrain LDA calculation would
result in a magnetic ground state with nonzero spin and orbital moment values.
For Pu compounds investigated in the present work, predominantly f^6

additional auxiliary chiral supermultiplet on a lattice. The model posssesses
an exact $\U(1)_R$ symmetry as a supersymmetric counterpart of the L\""uscher
lattice chiral $\U(1)$ symmetry. A restration of the supersymmetric
Ward-Takahashi identity in the continuum limit is analyzed in renormalized
perturbation theory. In the one-loop level, a supersymmetric continuum limit is
ensured by suitably adjusting a coefficient of a single local term $\tilde
F^*\tilde F$. The non-renormalization theorem holds to this order of
perturbation theory. In higher orders, on the other hand, coefficents of local
terms with dimension $\leq4$ that are consistent with the $\U(1)_R$ symmetry
have to be adjusted for a supersymmetric continuum limit. The origin of this
complexicity in higher-order loops is clarified on the basis of the Reisz power
counting theorem. Therefore, from a view point of supersymmetry, the present
formulation is not quite better than a lattice Wess-Zumino model formulated by
using Wilson fermions, although a number of coefficients which require
adjustment is much less due to the exact $\U(1)_R$ symmetry. We also comment on
an exact non-linear fermionic symmetry which corresponds to the one studied by
Bonini and Feo; an existence of this exact symmetry itself does not imply a
restoration of supersymmetry in the continuum limit without any adjustment of
parameters.

Spergel that on scales large compared with the relevant (interstellar

behave as a rigidity - stabilised solid, having an approximately isotropic

enough to be stable if the number of membranes meeting at a junction is even

nuclear generalized parton distributions (GPDs). Here, a realistic microscopic
calculation of the unpolarized quark GPD H_q of the 3He nucleus is reviewed. In
Impulse Approximation, H_q is obtained as a convolution between the GPD of the
internal nucleon and the non-diagonal spectral function, describing properly
Fermi motion and binding effects. The obtained formula has the correct limits.
Nuclear effects, evaluated by a modern realistic potential, are found to be
larger than in the forward case. In particular, they increase with increasing
the momentum transfer and the asymmetry of the process. Another feature of the
obtained results is that the nuclear GPD cannot be factorized into a
Delta^2-dependent and a Delta^2-independent term, as suggested in prescriptions
proposed for finite nuclei. The dependence of the obtained GPDs on different
realistic potentials used in the calculation shows that these quantities are
sensitive to the details of nuclear structure at short distances.

achieved a general scheme for the formation of basic material particles. A
basic particle, which may be e.g. an electron, is composed of a tiny free
aether-pole (a bare charge) and the mechanical wave disturbances -- identifying
with electromagnetic waves -- generated by it in the medium. When in motion, as
a result of a first kind source effect, this particle wave exhibits all of wave
and dynamic properties known for a de Broglie wave, and is here called a
Newton- de Broglie (NdB) particle wave. In a confined space, the Newtonian
solution for the NdB particle wave is equivalent to that given by Schrodinger's
quantum mechanics. Through this general scheme we have accomplished a basic
task of the unification of the classical- and the quantum- mechanics, both in
terms of the deduction of the latter from the former, and the convergence of
the latter into the former at high velocities. Through completing the task, we
unfold the origins of a series of phenomena including the electromagnetic
waves, the electromagnetic radiation and absorption, atomic and thermal
excitations, the inertial mass, the Schrodinger's wavefunction and de Broglie
wave, the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, the de Broglie relations, the
simultaneous existence of electron and positron or generally of particles and
their anti-particles, the (rest) mass-energy equivalence relation, etc. The

reveal the co-existence of two types of sales peaks: exogenous peaks occur
abruptly and are followed by a power law relaxation, while endogenous sale
peaks occur after a progressively accelerating power law growth followed by an
approximately symmetrical power law relaxation which is slower than for
exogenous peaks. We develop a simple epidemic model of buyers connected within
a network of acquaintances which propagates rumors and opinions on books. The
comparison between the predictions of the model and the empirical data confirms
the validity of the model and suggests in addition that social networks have
evolved to converge very close to criticality (here in the sense of critical

temperature environment on a Brownian test particle. We consider an Omhic
environment bilinearly coupled to an oscillator and compute the master
equation. From diffusive coefficients, we evaluate the decoherence time for the
usual quantum Brownian motion and also for an upside-down oscillator, as a toy
model of a quantum phase transition.

against the proposed attack by using a formula involved with the fraction of

  Quantum Computation","10 pages, 2 eps figures. Submitted to International Journal of
  Quantum Information","Int.J.Quant.Inf. 3 (2005) 611-621",,,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, it was shown that fundamental gates for theoretically efficient
quantum information processing can be realized by using single photon sources,
linear optics and quantum counters. One of these fundamental gates is the
NS-gate, that is, the one-mode non-linear sign shift. In this work, firstly, we
prove by a new rigorous proof that the upper bound of success probability of
NS-gates with only one helper photon and an undefined number of ancillary modes
is bounded by 0.25. Secondly, we explore the upper bound of success probability
of NS-gate with a new post-selection measurement. The idea behind this new
post-selection measurement is to condition the success of NS-gate
transformation to the observation of only one helper photon in whichever of the
output modes.
