galaxies (S0-Sab). We observed five early-type spiral galaxies with HII nuclei
(indicating circumnuclear starburst activities). These observations indicate
gas masses for the central kiloparsec of \sim 1-5% of the dynamical masses.
Such low gas mass fractions suggest that large-scale gravitational instability
in the gas is unlikely to be the driving cause for the starburst activities.
The Toomre Q values were >1 (mostly >3) within the central kiloparsec,
indicating that the gas disks are globally gravitationally stable. The area
filling factor of the gas disks is estimated to be about 0.05. This small value
indicates the existence of lumpy structure, i.e. molecular clouds, in the
globally-gravitationally stable disks. The typical surface density of the
molecular clouds is as high as \sim 3000 Msun pc^{-2}. We reconsider the nature
of the Toomre Q criterion, and conclude that the Q derived from CO observations
indicates neither star formation nor molecular cloud formation. This argument
should be valid not only for the circumnuclear disks but also for any region in
galactic disks. We tentatively explore an alternative model, i.e. cloud-cloud
collisions, as an initiating mechanism of star formation.

redshifts is calculated analytically. The clumps are initially assumed to be
galaxy group isothermal spheres with properties inferred from an extensive
survey. The average effect, which includes strong lensing, is exactly
counteracted by the beam divergence in between clumps (more precisely, the
average reciprocal magnification cancels the inverse Dyer-Roeder
demagnification). This conclusion is in fact independent of the matter density
function within each clump, and remains valid for arbitrary densities of matter
and dark energy. When tested against the CMB, a rather large lensing induced
{\it dispersion} in the angular size of the primary acoustic peaks of the TT
power spectrum is inconsistent with WMAP observations. The situation is
unchanged by the use of NFW profiles for the density distribution of groups.
Finally, our formulae are applied to an ensemble of NFW mass clumps or
isothermal spheres having the parameters of galaxy {\it clusters}. The acoustic
peak size dispersion remains unobservably large, and is also excluded by WMAP.
For galaxy groups, two possible ways of reconciling with the data are proposed,
both exploiting maximally the uncertainties in our knowledge of group
properties. The same escape routes are not available in the case of clusters,
however, because their properties are well understood. Here we have a more
robust conclusion: neither of the widely accepted models are good description
of clusters, or important elements of physics responsible for shaping zero
curvature space are missing from the standard cosmological model. When all the
effects are accrued, it is difficult to understand how WMAP could reveal no
evidence whatsoever of lensing by groups and clusters.

cases of strong and weak coupling to the molecular field are discussed. It is
found that BEC and BCS states give rise to an essentially coherent molecular
field with a momentum distribution determined by the zero-point motion in the
confining potential. On the other hand, a normal Fermi gas and the unpaired
atoms in the BCS state give rise to a molecular field with a broad momentum
distribution and thermal number statistics. It is shown that the first-order
correlations of the molecules can be used to measure second-order correlations

Clifford algebras and to relate such description to conformal maps in the
Clifford algebra over R(4,1), besides pointing out some applications of the
pure spinor formalism. We construct twistors in Minkowski spacetime as
algebraic spinors associated with the Dirac-Clifford algebra, using one lower
spacetime dimension than standard Clifford algebra formulations, since for this
purpose the Clifford algebra over R{4,1} is also used to describe conformal
maps, instead of R{2,4}. It is possible to identify the twistor fiber in four,
six and eight dimensions, respectively, with the coset spaces SO(4)/(SU(2) x
U(1)/Z_2) = CP1, SO(6)/(SU(3)x U(1)/Z_2) = CP3 and SO(8)/(Spin(6)x
Spin(2)/Z_2). The last homogeneous space is closely related to the SO(8) spinor
decomposition reserving SO(8) symmetry in type IIB superstring theory. Indeed,
aside the IIB theory, there is no SO(8) spinor decomposition preserving SO(8)
symmetry and, in this case, one can introduce distinct coordinates and
conjugate momenta only if the Spin(8) symmetry is broken by a Spin(6) x Spin(2)
subgroup of Spin(8). Also, it is reviewed how to generalize the Penrose
flagpole, constructing a flagpole that is more general than the Penrose one,
which arises in a particular case (Benn & Tucker description). We investigate
the well-known relation between this flagpole and the SO(2n)/U(n) twistorial
structure, which emerges when one considers the set X of all totally isotropic
subspaces of C{2n}, and an isomorphism from the set of pure spinors to X.
Finally we point out some relations between twistors fibrations and the
classification of compact homogeneous quaternionic-Kahler manifolds (the
so-called Wolf spaces), and exceptional Lie structures.

  Manifolds","21 pages, 17 figures","Physical Review A 70, 053405 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.70.053405",,"quant-ph",,"  We examine the conditions needed to accomplish stimulated Raman adiabatic
passage (STIRAP) when the three levels (g, e and f) are degenerate, with
arbitrary couplings contributing to the pump-pulse interaction (g - e) and to
the Stokes-pulse interaction (e-f). We show that in general a sufficient
condition for complete population removal from the g set of degenerate states
for arbitrary, pure or mixed, initial state is that the degeneracies should not
decrease along the sequence g, e and f. We show that when this condition holds
it is possible to achieve the degenerate counterpart of conventional STIRAP,
whereby adiabatic passage produces complete population transfer. Indeed, the
system is equivalent to a set of independent three-state systems, in each of
which a STIRAP procedure can be implemented. We describe a scheme of unitary
transformations that produces this result. We also examine the cases when this
degeneracy constraint does not hold, and show what can be accomplished in those
cases. For example, for angular momentum states when the degeneracy of the g
and f levels is less than that of the e level we show how a special choice for
the pulse polarizations and phases can produce complete removal of population
from the g set. Our scheme can be a powerful tool for coherent control in
degenerate systems, because of its robustness when selective addressing of the
states is not required or impossible. We illustrate the analysis with several
analytically solvable examples, in which the degeneracies originate from
angular momentum orientation, as expressed by magnetic sublevels.
