higher-order statistics as in the power spectrum at weakly nonlinear scales. We
discuss how one can use this information to determine the mean of the galaxy
halo occupation distribution (HOD) using only large-scale information, through
galaxy bias parameters determined from the galaxy bispectrum and trispectrum.
After introducing an averaged, reasonably fast to evaluate, trispectrum
estimator, we show that the expected errors on linear and quadratic bias
parameters can be reduced by at least 20-40%. Also, the inclusion of the
trispectrum information, which is sensitive to ""three-dimensionality"" of
structures, helps significantly in constraining the mass dependence of the HOD
mean. Our approach depends only on adequate modeling of the abundance and
large-scale clustering of halos and thus is independent of details of how
galaxies are distributed within halos. This provides a consistency check on the
traditional approach of using two-point statistics down to small scales, which
necessarily makes more assumptions. We present a detailed forecast of how well
our approach can be carried out in the case of the SDSS.

separated by the energy barriers and the transitions can be described as the
director slippage through these barriers. We extend our analysis to the case of
an asymmetric CLC cell in which the anchoring strengths at the two substrates

the intervals of twist wavenumbers representing locally stable configurations

will suppress the jump-like behaviour of the twist wavenumber.

exchangeable partition of the set of all natural numbers. This implies that the
weights $\W$ must be of a very special form depending on a single parameter

electronegative impurities of the order of ppb (O$_2$ equivalent). Such a high
purity is e.g. needed in a LAr drift chamber. The principle is to measure the
lifetime of quasifree electrons in LAr, since this is the important parameter
for the operation of a drift chamber. Free electrons are produced by ionizing
the LAr with $\alpha$-particles emitted by the $^{210}Po$ chain daughter of an
isotope $^{210}Pb$ source. From a measurement of the charge of the electron
cloud at the beginning and at the end of a drift path, together with the drift
time, the lifetime of the electrons is obtained. The $\alpha$-particles have a
very short range of about 50 \mu$m in LAr and the ionization density is very
high, typically between $750\div 1500\rm MeV/cm$, leading to a high
recombination rate. To suppress the recombination of the argon ions with the
electrons, the $\alpha$-source was put in a strong electric field of $40\div
150$ kV/cm. This was achieved by depositing the source on the surface of a
spherical high voltage cathode with a diameter of about 0.5 mm. The anode was
also made as a sphere of about the same diameter as the cathode, thus, close to
the axis between the two electrodes the electric drift field was approximately
a dipole field.

the two particular cases of non-entanglement (separable states) and maximal
entanglement (Bell's states). To this aim, we consider an internal (reversible)
measurement which preserves the probabilities by mirroring the states. We then
obtain logical judgements for both cases of separable and Bell's states.

  Lambda Configuration","7 pages and 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper, we study the suppression of adiabatic decoherence in a
three-level atom with $\Lambda$ configuration using bang-bang control
technique. We have given the decoupling bang-bang operation group, and
programmed a sequence of periodic radio frequency twinborn pulses to realize
the control process. Moreover, we have studied the process with non-ideal
situation and established the condition for efficient suppression of adiabatic
decoherence.
