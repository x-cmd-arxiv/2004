-- using the Las Campanas Du Pont 2.5 meter and Cerro Tololo Blanco 4 meter
telescopes in combination with a system of filters (Washington M, T_2 + DDO51)
useful for identifying low surface gravity, evolved stars. Identical
observations of nearby control fields provide a measure of the ``giant star''
background. Our data reach M_0=22 for three of the HVCs and M_0=21.25 for the
fourth, depths that allow the detection of any giant stars within 600 kpc.
Although we identify a number of faint late-type giant star candidates, we find
neither a coherent red giant branch structure nor a clear excess of giant
candidate counts in any HVC. This indicates that the giant candidates are
probably not related to the HVCs and are more likely to be either random Milky
Way giant stars or one of several classes of potential survey contaminants.
Echelle spectroscopy of the brightest giant candidates in one HVC and its
control field reveal radial velocities representative of the canonical Galactic
stellar populations. In addition to these null results, no evidence of any
young HVC stellar populations -- represented by blue main sequence stars -- is
found, a result consistent with previous searches. Our methodology,
specifically designed to find faint diffuse stellar populations, places the
tightest upper limit yet on the total stellar mass of HVCs of a few 10^5
M_{\sun}.

simulations. These suffer the disadvantage of having potential artefacts
arising from periodic boundary conditions but the advantage, when compared to
global simulations, of being able to capture much of the dynamics close to the
protoplanet at high resolution for low computational cost. Cases with and
without self sustained MHD turbulence are considered. The conditions for gap
formation and the transition from type I migration are investigated and found
to depend on whether the single parameter M_p R^3/(M_* H^3), with M_p, M_*, R
and H being the protoplanet mass, the central mass, the orbital radius and the
disk semi-thickness respectively exceeds a number of order unity. We also
investigate the coorbital torques experienced by a moving protoplanet in an
inviscid disk. This is done by demonstrating the equivalence of the problem for
a moving protoplanet to one where the protoplanet is in a fixed orbit which the
disk material flows through radially as a result of the action of an
appropriate external torque. For sustainable coorbital torques to be realized a
quasi steady state must be realized in which the planet migrates through the
disk without accreting significant mass. In that case although there is
sensitivity to computational parameters, in agreement with earlier work by
Masset & Papaloizou (2003) based on global simulations, the coorbital torques
are proportional to the migration speed and result in a positive feedback on
the migration, enhancing it and potentially leading to a runaway. This could
lead to a fast migration for protoplanets in the Saturn mass range in massive
disks and may be relevant to the mass period correlation for extrasolar planets
which gives a preponderance of sub Jovian masses at short orbital period.

suppressed, and the effects are most important when dissipation occurs below
the baryonic photosphere. In both cases an increased photospheric luminosity is
obtained. We suggest that the spectral peak in gamma ray bursts is essentially
due to the Comptonized thermal component from the photosphere, where the
comoving optical depth in the outflow falls to unity. Typical peak photon
energies range between those of classical bursts and X-ray flashes. The

that a wide range of predetermined scheduling algorithms result in planet
searches with similar sensitivities. We have developed adaptive scheduling
algorithms which have a solid basis in Bayesian inference and information
theory and also are computationally feasible for modern planet searches. We
have performed Monte Carlo simulations of plausible planet searches to test the
power of adaptive scheduling algorithms. Our simulations demonstrate that
planet searches performed with adaptive scheduling algorithms can
simultaneously detect more planets, detect less massive planets, and measure
orbital parameters more accurately than comparable surveys using a non-adaptive

SOFI at the ESO 3.5m New Technology Telescope. Because of wavelength dependence
of the attenuation, the detection of the Pa_alfa or Br_gamma line in the Ks
band should provide relevant constraints on SFR and the contribution of an AGN.
We find, however, that the intensities of the Pa_alfa and Br_gamma lines, even
corrected for slit losses, are on average only 10% and 40%, respectively, of
that expected from a normal starburst of similar bolometric luminosity. The
corresponding star formation rates, after correcting for the attenuation
derived from the NIR-optical emission line ratios, are 14% and 60% of that
expected if the far infrared luminosity were entirely powered by the starburst.
This confirms the existence of a recombination photon deficit, particularly in
the case of the Pa_alfa line, already found in the Br_gamma line in other
infrared galaxies of similar luminosity. In discussing the possible causes of
the discrepancy, we find unlikely that it is due to the presence of an AGN,
though two objects show evidence of broadening of the Pa_alfa line and of the
presence of coronal line emission. In fact, from our own observations and data
collected from the literature we argue that the studied galaxies appear to be
predominantly powered by a nuclear starburst. Two scenarios compatible with the
present data are that either there exists a highly attenuated nuclear star
forming region, and/or that a significant fraction of the ionizing photons are
absorbed by dust within the HII regions. We suggest that observations in the

detection of the 34.6um absorption line. Only 5 objects from the sample (3 red
supergiants and 2 galactic center sources) are found to show clear 34.6um
absorption (all of them already known) while two additional objects only
tentatively show this line. The 3 supergiants show similar pump rates and their
masers might be purely radiatively pumped. The pump rates of OH masers in late
type stars are found to be about 0.05, only 1/5 of the theoretical value of
0.25 derived by Elitzur (1992). We have also found 16 maser sources which,
according to the analysis assuming Elitzur's pump rate, should show the 34.6

explained by far-infrared photon pumping, clumpy nature of the OH masing region

ensures that SMS free energy satisfies the requirement of thermodynamic
stability everywhere including T=0, but need not represent a pysically
observable metastable state over the range where the entropy under continuation
becomes negative. We consider a 1-dimensional m-component axis-spin model
involving only nearest-neighbor interactions, which is solved exactly. The
high-temperature expansion of the model representys a polymer problem in which
m acts as the activity of a loop formation. We follow deGennes and trerat m as
a real variable. A thermodynamic phase transition occurs in the model for m<1.
The analytic continuation of the high-temperature disordered phase free energy
below the transition represents the free energy of the metastable state. The

two likely charged macroions can attract each other due to correlations of
Z-ions adsorbed on their surfaces. This ""correlation"" attraction is
short-ranged and decays exponentially with increasing distance between
macroions at characteristic distance A/2\pi, where A is the average distance
between Z-ions on the surfaces of macroions. In this work, we show that an
additional long range ""polarization"" attraction exists when the bare surface
charge densities of the two macroions have the same sign, but are different in
absolute values. The key idea is that with adsorbed Z-ions, two insulating
macroions can be considered as conductors with fixed but different electric
potentials. Each potential is determined by the difference between the entropic
bulk chemical potential of a Z-ion and its correlation chemical potential at
the surface of the macroion determined by its bare surface charge density. When
the two macroions are close enough, they get polarized in such a way that their
adjacent spots form a charged capacitor, which leads to attraction. In a salt
free solution this polarization attractive force is long ranged: it decays as a
power of the distance between the surfaces of two macroions, d. The
polarization force decays slower than the van der Waals attraction and
therefore is much larger than it in a large range of distances. In the presence
of large amount of monovalent salt, when A/2\pi<< d<< r_s (r_s is the
Debye-H\""{u}ckel screening radius), this force is still much stronger than the
van der Waals attraction and the correlation attraction mentioned above.

bridges, signatures of spatiotemporal inhomogeneities; we review their
geometrical characteristics and compare theoretical results with those of
independent simulations. {\it Cooperative} excitations due to local density
fluctuations are also responsible for relaxation at the angle of repose; the
{\it competition} between these fluctuations and external driving forces, can,
on the other hand, result in a (rare) collapse of the sandpile to the

granular compaction; we review here a random graph model, where three-spin

sensitivity to Planck-scale effects can be achieved, we should now rely on
detailed analyses of some reference test theories. I illustrate this point in
the specific example of studies of Planck-scale modifications of the
energy/momentum dispersion relation, for which I consider two test theories.
Both the photon-stability analyses and the Crab-nebula synchrotron-radiation
analyses, which had raised high hopes of ``beyond-Plankian'' experimental
bounds, turn out to be rather ineffective in constraining the two test
theories. Examples of analyses which can provide constraints of rather wide

observations of gamma-ray bursts, and the analyses of the cosmic-ray spectrum

$b=2m_c-M$ is introduced to regularize the infrared divergence of the vertex

divergences, for which we adopt a model dependent parametrization. If we
neglect possible strong phases in the hard spectator contributions, we obtain a
too small branching ratio for $\chi_{c0}K$ while too large one for
$\chi_{c2}K$, as can be seen from the ratio of the branching ratio of $B^+ \to

possible to accommodate the experimental data. This shows that, for $B\to

atom-cavity detuning and number of atoms. Data is compared with a rate equation
model and fully quantized treatment based on micromaser theory. Good agreement
between theory and experiment is found when the cavity is resonant with atoms
of the most probable velocity, but long lifetimes of metastable states preclude
the observation of true steady-state transition points. For nonzero atom-cavity
detuning the microlaser displays broadenings and shifts which are not yet
well-understood. Quantum trajectory simulations are performed to investigate
many-atom and finite transit time effects in the microlaser. We show that over

nanomagnetic planar design where a localized Angstrom-scale point in
three-dimensional space is created above the nanostructure with a non-zero
minimum of the magnetic field magnitude. The design thereby represents a
magnetic resonance microscopy lens where potentially only a single spin located
in the focus spot of the structure is resonant. Despite the presence of other
spins in the Angstrom-scale vicinity of the resonant spin, the high gradient
magnetic field of the lens renders those spins inactive in the detection
process.

ground atmosphere of 13km. It is shown that the desired entanglement can still
survive after the two entangled photons have passed through the noisy ground
atmosphere. This is confirmed by observing a space-like separated violation of
Bell inequality of $2.45 \pm 0.09$. On this basis, we exploit the distributed
entangled photon source to demonstrate the BB84 quantum cryptography scheme.
The distribution distance of entangled photon pairs achieved in the experiment
is for the first time well beyond the effective thickness of the aerosphere,
hence presenting a significant step towards satellite-based global quantum
communication.

specific dynamics of electronic states and vibrational wavefunction. We discuss
the dynamical formation of entanglement between electronic and vibrational
degrees of freedom in molecular aggregates with theory of electronic energy
transfer and the method of vibronic 2D wavepackets [Cina, Kilin, Humble, J.
Chem. Phys. 118, 46 (2003)]. The vibronic dynamics is also described by
applying Jaynes-Cummings model to the electronic energy transfer [Kilin,
Pereverzev, Prezhdo, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 11209 (2004);math-ph/0403023].
Following the ultrafast excitation of donor[chem-ph/9411004] the population of
acceptor rises by small portions per each vibrational period, oscillates force
and back between donor and acceptor with later damping and partial revivals of
this oscillation. The transfer rate gets larger as donor wavepacket approaches
the acceptor equilibrium configuration, which is possible at specific energy
differences of donor and acceptor and at maximal amount of the vibrational
motion along the line that links donor and acceptor equilibria positions. The
four-pulse phase-locked nonlinear wavepacket 2D interferograms reflect the
shape of the relevant 2D vibronic wavepackets and have maxima at longer delay
between excitation pulses for dimers with equal donor-acceptor energy
difference compare to dimers with activationless energy configuration [Cina,
Fleming, J. Phys. Chem. A. 108, 11196 (2004)].
