Survey (SDSS) quasars. We compute the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of
SDSS quasars in redshift space at $8h^{-1}{\rm Mpc} < s < 500h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$,
with particular attention to its baryonic signature. Our sample consists of
19986 quasars extracted from the SDSS Data Release 4 (DR4). The redshift range
of the sample is $0.72 \le z \le 2.24$ (the mean redshift is $\bar z = 1.46$)
and the reddening-corrected $i$-band apparent magnitude range is $15.0 \le
m_{i,{\rm rc}} \le 19.1$. Due to the relatively low number density of the
quasar sample, the bump in the power spectrum due to the baryon density,
$\Omega_{\rm b}$, is not clearly visible. The effect of the baryon density is,
however, to distort the overall shape of the 2PCF.The degree of distortion
makes it an interesting alternate measure of the baryonic signature. Assuming a
scale-independent linear bias and the spatially flat universe, i.e.,
$\Omega_{\rm b} + \Omega_{\rm d} + \Omega_\Lambda =1$, where $\Omega_{\rm d}$
and $\Omega_\Lambda$ denote the density parameters of dark matter and the
cosmological constant, we combine the observed quasar 2PCF and the predicted
matter 2PCF to put constraints on $\Omega_{\rm b}$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. Our
result is fitted as $0.80- 2.8\Omega_{\rm b} < \Omega_\Lambda < 0.90 -
1.4\Omega_{\rm b}$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, which is consistent with
results from other cosmological observations such as WMAP. (abridged)

one-dimensional mass power spectrum is inversely proportional to the number of
lines of sight that are sampled from each random field. The correlation between
lines of sight in a single field may alter the covariance. However, lines of
sight that are sampled far apart are only weakly correlated, so that they can
be treated as independent samples. Using N-body simulations, we find that the
covariance matrix of the one-dimensional mass power spectrum is not diagonal
for the cosmic density field due to the non-Gaussianity and that the variance
is much higher than that of Gaussian random fields. From the covariance, one
will be able to determine the cosmic variance in the measured one-dimensional

temperatures. This study differs from previous studies done at infinite
temperature in that the vacancy here executes highly active walks, which are
subjected to nonlinear feedbacks, instead of the random walks that take place
in the limit of T ->infinity. We find that the slope of the log-log plot of
A(L; T; t) vs. t for finite temperatures follows the temperature dependence
given by the Gompertz function and reaches a limiting value of 1/2 only as the
temperature approaches infinity. For the structure factors, namely, Sk(t) vs.
t, the overall features are similar to those found at infinite T. The two key
differences between our results and those at infinite T are the saturated value
and the intermediate region in which the portion of the graph whose slope is

clusters of a normal phase is considered. Transition of the superconductor into
a resistive state corresponds to the percolation transition from a pinned
vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices are free to move. The
motion of the magnetic flux transferred by these vortices gives rise to the
region of initial dissipation on current-voltage characteristic. The influence
of normal phase clusters on distinctive features of current-voltage
characteristics of percolative type-II superconductors is considered. It is
found that an increase in the fractal dimension of the normal phase clusters
causes the initial dissipation region to broaden out. The reason of this effect
is an increase in the density of free vortices broken away from the pinning
centers by the Lorentz force. Dependencies of the free vortex density on the
fractal dimension of the normal phase cluster boundaries are obtained.

formulated in terms of link variables which are subject to the Bianchi
constraints. Using this representation we derive exact and local dual
formulation for the partition function of such models on a cubic lattice in
arbitrary dimension D. Locality means that the dual action is given by a sum
over some subset of hypercubes of the dual lattice and the interaction between
dual variables ranges over one given hypercube. Dual variables are in general
discrete-valued and live on (D-2)-cell of the dual lattice, in close analogy
with the XY model. We use our construction to study in details the dual of
SU(2) principal chiral model in two dimensions. We give dual expressions also
for two-point correlation function in arbitrary representation and for the free
energy of defects. Leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the dual
Boltzmann factor are computed and it is proven that at low temperatures it
converges to a certain Gaussian distribution uniformly in all fluctuations of
dual variables. This result enables us to define the semiclassical limit of the
dual formulation and to determine an analog of the vortex--spin-wave
representation for the partition function. Such representation is used to
extract leading perturbative contribution to the correlation function which
shows power-like decay at weak coupling. We also present some analytical
evidences that the low-temperature limit of the dual formulation is completely
described by ISO(2)-like approximation of SU(2) matrix elements.

model, the equation of state of hot asymmetric nuclear matter and its isospin
dependence have been investigated. The critical temperature of liquid-gas phase
transition for symmetric nuclear matter has been calculated and compared with
other predictions. It turns out that the three-body force gives a repulsive
contribution to the equation of state which is stronger at higher density and
as a consequence reduces the critical temperature of liquid-gas phase
transition. The calculated energy per nucleon of hot asymmetric nuclear matter
is shown to satisfy a simple quadratic dependence on asymmetric parameter
$\beta$ as in the zero-temperature case. The symmetry energy and its density
dependence have been obtained and discussed. Our results show that the
three-body force affects strongly the high-density behavior of the symmetry
energy and makes the symmetry energy more sensitive to the variation of
temperature. The temperature dependence and the isospin dependence of other
physical quantities, such as the proton and neutron single particle potentials
and effective masses are also studied. Due to the additional repulsion produced
by the three-body force contribution, the proton and neutron single particle
potentials are correspondingly enhanced as similar to the zero-temperature
case.

structure has been observed in the calculated isotherms (of pressure) for
symmetric nuclear matter implying the presence of the liquid-gas phase
transition. The critical temperature of the phase transition is calculated and
its dependence on the proton-to-neutron ratio is discussed. It is shown that
the three-body force gives a repulsive contribution to the nuclear equation of
state and reduces appreciably the critical temperature and the mechanical
instable region. At fixed temperature and density the pressure of asymmetric
nuclear matter increases monotonically as a function of isospin asymmetry. In
addition, it turns out that the domain of mechanical instability for hot
asymmetric nuclear matter gradually shrinks with increasing asymmetry and
temperature. We have compared our results with the predictions of other
theoretical models especially the Dirac Brueckner approach. A possible
explanation for the discrepancy between the values of the critical temperature
predicted by the present non-relativistic Brueckner calculations including the
three-body force and the relativistic Dirac-Brueckner method is given.

threshold baryon density for kaon condensation in chemical equilibrium neutron
star matter and on the composition of the kaon condensed phase in the framework
of the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach. Our results show that the nuclear
three-body force affects strongly the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry
energy and consequently reduces considerably the critical density for kaon
condensation provided that the proton strangeness content is not very large.
The dependence of the threshold density on the symmetry energy becomes weaker
as the proton strangeness content increases. The kaon condensed phase of
neutron star matter turns out to be proton-rich instead of neutron-rich. The
three-body force has an important influence on the composition of the kaon
condensed phase. Inclusion of the three-body force contribution in the nuclear
symmetry energy results in a significant reduction of the proton and kaon
fractions in the kaon condensed phase which is more proton-rich in the case of
no three-body force. Our results are compared to other theoretical predictions
by adopting different models for the nuclear symmetry energy. The possible
implications of our results for the neutron star structure are also briefly
discussed.

is used to study the $2\nu\beta\beta$ properties of ten isotopes, exhibiting
various quadrupole deformations. The mother and daughter nuclei exhibit
different quadrupole deformations. Since the projected basis enables a unified
description of deformed and spherical nuclei, situations where the nuclei
involved in the double beta decay process are both spherical, both deformed or
one spherical and another deformed, can be treated through a sole formalism.
Dependence of single $\beta^-$ and $\beta^+$ strength distribution on atomic
mass number and nuclear deformation is analyzed. For the double beta decay
process, the Gamow-Teller transition amplitudes and half lives are calculated.
Results are compared with the experimental data as well as with the predictions

derived. The law is universal for all species, from single cell yeast to
humans. It includes no characteristics of animal- environment interactions
(metabolism etc) which are a must for life. Such law is unique for live systems
with their homeostatic self-adjustment to environment. Its universal dynamics
for all animals, with their drastically different biology, evolutionary
history, and complexity, is also unique for live systems-cf different
thermodynamics of e.g. liquids and glasses. The law which is valid for all
live, and only live, systems is a life specific law of nature. Mortality is an
instrument of natural selection and biological diversity. Its law which is
preserved in evolution of all species is a conservation law of mortality,
selection, evolution, biology. The law implies new kind of mortality and
adaptation which dominate in evolutionary unprecedented protected populations
and, in contrast to species specific natural selection, proceed via universal
stepwise rungs. The law demonstrates that intrinsic mortality and at least
certain aspects of aging are disposable evolutionary byproducts, and directed
genetic and/or biological changes may yield healthy and vital Methuselah
lifespan. This is consistent with experiments. Universality implies that single
cell yeast may provide a master key to the cellular mechanism of universal
mortality, aging, selection, evolution, and its regulation in all animals. One
may look for its manifestations in animal cells also, e.g., in their
replicative senescence.

against multiple targets. We propose that the final effect of partial, but
multiple drug actions might often surpass that of complete drug action at a
single target. The future success of this novel drug design paradigm will
