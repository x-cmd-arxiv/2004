provide valuable clues that can help pin down the mechanism responsible for the
acceleration and collimation of GRB jets. The most promising way of probing it
is through polarization measurements of the synchrotron emission from the GRB
ejecta, which includes the gamma-ray emission and the reverse shock emission.
Measuring polarization in gamma-rays with current instruments is extremely
difficult: so far there is only one claim of detection (in GRB 021206) which
despite the favorable conditions remains very controversial. The emission from
the reverse shock that propagates into the ejecta as it is decelerated by the
ambient medium peaks in the optical after tens of seconds (the `optical flash')
and dominates the optical emission up to about ten minutes after the GRB.
Unfortunately, no polarization measurements of this optical emission have been
made to date. However, after the reverse shock finishes crossing the shell of
GRB ejecta, the shocked ejecta cools adiabatically and radiates at lower and
lower frequencies, peaking in the radio after $\sim 1$ day (the `radio flare').
We use VLA data of radio flares from GRBs to constrain the polarization of this
emission. We find only upper limits for both linear and circular polarization.
Our best limits are for GRB 991216, for which we find $3\sigma$ upper limits on
the linear and circular polarization of 7% and 9%, respectively. These limits
provide interesting constraints on existing GRB models. Specifically, our
results are hard to reconcile with a predominantly ordered toroidal magnetic
field in the GRB outflow together with a `structured' jet, where the energy per
solid angle drops as the inverse square of the angle from the jet axis, that is
expected in models where the outflow is Poynting flux dominated.

playing the role of the dark energy is exponentially coupled to the Ricci

equivalent to a tracking solution with equation of state w=-1/3, providing a
large basin of attraction for the initial dark energy density regardless of the
properties of the potential energy yielding acceleration today. We derive the
up to date constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) on the present

trajectories of the dark energy scalar field in the early universe. We compute
the cosmological perturbation spectra in these cosmologies. For a fixed value
of omegaJBD0, the projection and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects on the cosmic
microwave background anisotropy are considerably larger in the exponential case
with respect to a quadratic non-minimal coupling, reflecting the fact that the
effective gravitational constant depends exponentially on the dynamics of the

a unique role in these studies by imaging thermal dust emission in a
representative sample of protoplanetary disks at unprecedented sub-AU scales in
the innermost regions, including the ``habitable zone'' that lies within a few
AU of the central stars. Radio observations will probe the evolution of dust
grains up to centimeter-sized ``pebbles'', the critical first step in
assembling giant planet cores and terrestrial planets, through the wavelength
dependence of dust emissivity, which provides a diagnostic of particle size.
High resolution images of dust emission will show directly mass concentrations
and features in disk surface density related to planet building, in particular
the radial gaps opened by tidal interactions between planets and disks, and
spiral waves driven by embedded protoplanets. Moreover, because orbital
timescales are short in the inner disk, synoptic studies over months and years
will show proper motions and allow for the tracking of secular changes in disk
structure. SKA imaging of protoplanetary disks will reach into the realm of
rocky planets for the first time, and they will help clarify the effects of the

such scenario, the fact that massive spheroidal galaxies appear to have formed
much earlier and faster than predicted by previous semi-analytical models.
After having assessed the values of the two parameters that control the effect
of the complex radiative transfer processes on the time-dependent SEDs we have
compared the model predictions with a variety of IR to mm data. Our results
support a rather strict continuity between objects where stars formed and
evolved massive early-type galaxies, indicating that large spheroidal galaxies
formed most of their stars when they were already assembled as single objects.
The model is successful in reproducing the observed z distribution of K\le20
galaxies at z>1, in contrast with both the classical monolithic and the
semi-analytic models, the ratio of star-forming to passively evolving spheroids
and the counts and z distributions of EROs. The model also favourably compares
with the ISOCAM 6.7 mu counts, with the corresponding z distribution, and with
IRAC counts, which probe primarily the passive evolution phase, and with the
submm SCUBA and MAMBO data, probing the active star-formation phase. The
observed fraction of 24mu selected sources with no detectable emission in

star-forming spheroids with 8mu fluxes below the detection limit. Predictions
for the z distributions of 24mu sources detected by MIPS surveys are pointed

differential rotation of rapidly rotating cool stars but, in a small number of
cases, also about temporal variations, which possibly are analogous to the
solar torsional oscillations. Given the present difficulties in resolving the
precise nature of such variations, due to both the short length and poor
resolution of the available data, theoretical input is vital to help assess the
modes of behaviour that might be expected, and will facilitate interpretation
of the observations. Here we take a first step in this direction by studying
the variations in the convection zones of such stars, using a two dimensional
axisymmetric mean field dynamo model operating in a spherical shell in which
the only nonlinearity is the action of the azimuthal component of the Lorentz
force of the dynamo generated magnetic field on the stellar angular velocity.
We consider three families of models with different depths of dynamo-active
regions. For moderately supercritical dynamo numbers we find torsional
oscillations that penetrate all the way down to the bottom of the convection
zones, similar to the case of the Sun. For larger dynamo numbers we find
fragmentation in some cases and sometimes there are other dynamical modes of
behaviour, including quasi-periodicity and chaos. We find that the largest
deviations in the angular velocity distribution caused by the Lorentz force are
of the order of few percent, implying that the original assumed `background'
rotation field is not strongly distorted.

lines to different stellar parameters. We have obtained consistent fits of the
UV and the optical spectrum to derive the effective temperature, surface
gravity, surface composition, and microturbulent velocity of each star. Stellar
radii, masses, luminosities and ages then follow. Similarly to more limited
recent studies, we derive cooler temperatures than the standard Teff
calibration of O stars. We propose a new calibration between the spectral type
and effective temperature based on our results from UV metal lines as well as
optical hydrogen and helium lines. For stars of the same spectral subtype, we
find a general good agreement between Teff determinations obtained with TLUSTY,
CMFGEN, and FASTWIND models. We derive ionizing luminosities that are smaller
by a factor of 3 compared to luminosities inferred from previous standard
calibrations. The chemical composition analysis reveals that the surface of
about 3/4 of the program stars is moderately to strongly enriched in nitrogen,
while showing the original helium, carbon, and oxygen abundances. Our results
support the new stellar evolution models that predict that the surface of fast
rotating stars becomes N-rich during the main sequence phase because of
rotationally-induced mixing. Most stars exhibit the ``mass discrepancy''
problem. This discrepancy too is a result of fast rotation which lowers the

atmosphere and wind codes, TLUSTY and CMFGEN. We have derived the stellar and
wind parameters and the surface composition of the two stars. The surface of
HD190429A has a composition typical of an evolved O supergiant (N-rich, C and
O-poor), while HD96715 exhibits surface N enhancement similar to the enrichment
found in SMC O dwarfs and attributed to rotationally-induced mixing. We find
that homogeneous wind models could not match the observed profile of O V1371
and require very low phosphorus abundance to fit the P V1118-1128 resonance
lines. However, we are able to match the O V and P V lines using clumped wind
models. We find that N IV1718 is also sensitive to wind clumping. For both
stars, we have calculated clumped wind models that match well all these lines
from different species and that remain consistent with Halpha data. These fits
therefore provide a coherent and thus much stronger evidence of wind clumping
in O stars than earlier claims. We find that the wind of these two stars is
highly clumped, as expressed by very small volume filling factors, namely
f=0.04 for HD190429A and f=0.02 for HD96715. In agreement with our analysis of
SMC stars, clumping starts deep in the wind, just above the sonic point. The
most crucial consequence of our analysis is that the mass loss rates of O stars
need to be revised downward significantly, by a factor of 3 and more.
Accounting for wind clumping is essential when determining the wind properties
of O stars. Our study therefore calls for a fundamental revision in our
understanding of mass loss and of O-type star winds. (abridged)

absorption systems along lines of sight to bright quasars have opened a new
window onto the ``warm-hot intergalactic medium'' (WHIM). These systems appear
to provide a significant reservoir for baryons in the local universe, and
comparison to cosmological simulations suggests that their abundance roughly
matches theoretical predictions. Here we use analytic arguments to elucidate
the physical properties of the absorbers and their role in structure formation.
We first show that if the absorbers result from structure-formation shocks, the
observed column densities naturally follow from postshock-cooling models, if we
include fast-cooling shocks as well as those that cannot cool within a Hubble
time. In this case, the known OVI absorbers should show stronger OVII
absorption than expected from collisional-ionization equilibrium (and much more
than expected for photoionized systems). We then argue that higher-temperature
shocks will be spatially associated with more massive virialized objects even
well outside the virial radius. Thus the different oxygen ions will trace
different structures; OVII absorbers are the most common because that ion
dominates over a wide temperature range (corresponding to a large range in halo
mass). If each dark-matter halo is surrounded by a network of shocks with total
cross section a few times the size of the virialized systems, then we can
reproduce the observed number densities of absorbers with plausible parameters.
A simple comparison with simulations shows that these assumptions are
reasonable, although the actual distribution of shocked gas is too complex for
analytic models to describe fully. Our models suggest that these absorbers
cannot be explained as a single-temperature phase.

the closed field line region of the magnetosphere of its normal pulsar
companion B. A's radio beam only illuminates B's magnetosphere for about 10
minutes surrounding the time of eclipse. During this time it heats particles at
r\gtrsim 10^9 cm to relativistic energies and enables extra plasma to be
trapped by magnetic mirroring. An enhancement of the plasma density by a factor
\sim 10^2 is required to match the duration and optical depth of the observed
eclipses. The extra plasma might be supplied by a source near B through B\gamma
pair creation by energetic photons produced in B's outer gap. Excitation of
pairs' gyrational motions by cyclotron absorption of A's radio beam can result
in their becoming trapped between conjugate mirror points in B's magnetosphere.
Because the trapping efficiency decreases with increasing optical depth, the
plasma density enhancement saturates even under steady state illumination. The
result is an eclipse with finite, frequency dependent, optical depth. After
illumination by A's radio beam ceases, the trapped particles cool and are lost.
The entire cycle repeats every orbital period. We speculate that the
asymmetries between eclipse ingress and egress result in part from the
magnetosphere's evolution toward a steady state when illuminated by A's radio
beam. We predict that A's linear polarization will vary with both eclipse phase
and B's rotational phase.

function drops by almost two orders of magnitude from 1 M_Sun stellar
companions to the brown dwarf desert and then rises by more than an order of

in the number of companions in the brown dwarf regime, compared to the initial

either a different spectrum of gravitational fragmentation in the formation

test the compatibility of our results with data drawn from a larger volume. We
find that at all redshifts, the SSFR decreases with increasing galaxy stellar
mass suggesting that star formation contributes more to the growth of low mass
galaxies than to the growth of high mass galaxies, and that high mass galaxies
formed the bulk of their stellar content before z=1. At each epoch we find a
ridge in SSFR versus stellar mass that is parallel to lines of constant SFR and
evolves independently of galaxy stellar mass to a particular turnover mass.
Galaxies above this turnover mass show a sharp decrease in the SFR compared to
the average at each epoch and the turnover mass increases with redshift. The
SFR along the SSFR ridge decreases by roughly a factor of 10, from 10 Msun/yr
at z=1.5 to 1 Msun/yr at z=0. High mass galaxies could sustain the observed
rates of star formation over the 10 Gyr observed, but low mass galaxies likely

substructure--substructure interactions, the last of which has previously been
ignored in analytic models of substructure evolution. Our semi-analytical
treatment reproduces both the spatial distribution of substructures and their
mass function as obtained from the most recent N-body cosmological calculations
of Gao et al. (2004). We find that, if mass loss is taken into account, the
present distribution of substructures is practically insensitive to dynamical
friction and scatterings from other substructures.
  Implementing these phenomena leads to a slight increase (~5%) in the number
of substructures at r<0.35 r_vir, whereas their effects on the mass function
are negligible. We find that mass loss processes lead to the disruption of
substructures before dynamical friction and gravitational scattering can
significantly alter their orbits. Our results suggest that the present
substructure distribution at r>0.35 r_vir reflects the orbital properties at
infall and is, therefore, purely determined by the dark matter environment
around the host halo and has not been altered by dynamical evolution.

evidence such as the characteristic gamma-ray signature of decaying pions has
been found so far. These pions would be a direct tracer of hadronic CRp
interactions with the ambient thermal gas also yielding observable synchrotron
and inverse Compton emission by additionally produced secondary electrons. The
obvious question concerns the type of galaxy clusters most likely to yield a
signal: Particularly suited sites should be cluster cooling cores due to their
high gas and magnetic energy densities. We studied a nearby sample of clusters
evincing cooling cores in order to place stringent limits on the cluster CRp
population by using non-detections of EGRET. In this context, we examined the
possibility of a hadronic origin of Coma-sized radio halos as well as radio
mini-halos. Especially for mini-halos, strong clues are provided by the very
plausible small amount of required CRp energy density and a matching radio
profile. Introducing the hadronic minimum energy criterion, we show that the
energetically favored CRp energy density is constrained to 2% +/- 1% of the
thermal energy density in Perseus. We also studied the CRp population within
the cooling core region of Virgo using the TeV gamma-ray detection of M 87 by
HEGRA. Both the expected radial gamma-ray profile and the required amount of
CRp support this hadronic scenario.

Silberberg's hypotheses. We demonstrate that for ultrathin films where the
thickness, $H$, is smaller than the excluded volume screening length (blob
size), $\xi$, the chain size parallel to the walls diverges logarithmically,
$R^2/2N \approx b^2 + c \log(N)$ with $c \sim 1/H$. The corresponding bond-bond
correlation function decreases like a power law, $C(s) = d/s^{\omega}$ with $s$
being the curvilinear distance between bonds and $\omega=1$. % Upon increasing
the film thickness, $H$, we find -- in contrast to Flory's hypothesis -- the
bulk exponent $\omega=3/2$ and, more importantly, an {\em decreasing} $d(H)$
that gives direct evidence for an {\em enhanced} self-interaction of chain
segments reflected at the walls. Systematic deviations from the Kratky plateau
as a function of $H$ are found for the single chain form factor parallel to the
walls in agreement with the {\em non-monotonous} behaviour predicted by theory.
This structure in the Kratky plateau might give rise to an erroneous estimation
of the chain extension from scattering experiments. For large $H$ the
deviations are linear with the wave vector, $q$, but are very weak. In
contrast, for ultrathin films, $H<\xi$, very strong corrections are found
(albeit logarithmic in $q$) suggesting a possible experimental verification of
our results.

small c-axis magnetic field penetrates in the form of vortex chains. In
general, the structure of a single chain is determined by the ratio of the
London [$\lambda$] and Josephson [$\lambda_{J}$] lengths, $\alpha=
\lambda/\lambda_{J}$. The chain is composed of tilted vortices at large
$\alpha$'s (tilted chain) and at small $\alpha$'s it consists of a crossing
array of Josephson vortices and pancake-vortex stacks (crossing chain). We
study chain structures at intermediate $\alpha$'s and found two types of phase
transitions. For $\alpha\lesssim 0.6$ the ground state is given by the crossing
chain in a wide range of pancake separations $a\gtrsim [2-3]\lambda_J$.
However, due to attractive coupling between deformed pancake stacks, the
equilibrium separation can not exceed some maximum value depending on the
in-plane field and $\alpha$. The first phase transition takes place with
decreasing pancake-stack separation $a$ at $a=[1-2]\lambda_{J}$, and rather
wide range of the ratio $\alpha$, $0.4 \lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.65$. With
decreasing $a$, the crossing chain goes through intermediate strongly-deformed

phase transition. Another phase transition occurs at very small densities of
pancake vortices, $a\sim [20-30]\lambda_J$, and only when $\alpha$ exceeds a
certain critical value $\sim 0.5$. In this case a small c-axis field penetrates
in the form of kinks. However, at very small concentration of kinks, the kinked
chains are replaced with strongly deformed crossing chains via a first-order
phase transition. This transition is accompanied by a very large jump in the
pancake density.

towards a holographic approach to gravity which is independent of the detailed
microstructure of spacetime. These features of the EH action include: (a) the
existence of second derivatives of dynamical variables; (b) a non trivial
relation between the surface term and the bulk term; (c) the fact that surface
term is non analytic in the coupling constant, when gravity is treated as a
spin-2 perturbation around flat spacetime and (d) the form of the variation of
the surface term under infinitesimal coordinate transformations. The surface
term can be derived directly from very general considerations and using (d) one
can obtain Einstein's equations {\it just from the surface term of the action}.
Further one can relate the bulk term to the surface term and derive the full EH
action based on purely thermodynamic considerations. The features (a), (b) and
(c) above emerge in a natural fashion in this approach. It is shown that action
$A_{grav}$ splits into two terms $-S+\beta E$ in a natural manner \textit{in
any stationary spacetime with horizon}, where $E$ is essentially an integral
over ADM energy density and $S$ arises from the integral of the surface gravity
over the horizon. This analysis shows that the true degrees of freedom of
gravity reside in the surface term of the action, making gravity intrinsically
holographic. It also provides a close connection between gravity and gauge
theories, and highlights the subtle role of the singular coordinate
transformations.

characteristic of QCD: for real photons ($K^2=0$) electromagnetic gauge
invariance constrains the first moment to vanish; the limit for asymptotic
photon virtuality ($m_\rho^2 \ll K^2 \ll Q^2$) is governed by the
electromagnetic $U_A(1)$ axial anomaly and the approach to asymptopia by the
gluonic anomaly; for intermediate values of $K^2$, it reflects the realisation
of chiral symmetry and is determined by the off-shell radiative couplings of
the pseudoscalar mesons; finally, like many polarisation phenomena in QCD, the
first moment of $g_1^\gamma$ involves the gluon topological susceptibility. In
this paper, we review the original sum rule proposed by Narison, Shore and
Veneziano and extend the relation with pseudoscalar mesons. The possibility of
measuring the sum rule in future polarised $e^+ e^-$ colliders is then
considered in detail, focusing on the International Linear Collider (ILC) and

scenario in which the resulting baryon to entropy ratio is determined by the
amplitude of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The model
involves a new $SU(2)_L$ scalar field which generates a Dirac neutrino mass and
which is excited by quantum fluctuations during inflation, yielding a
CP-violating phase. During the scalar field decay after inflation, an asymmetry
in the left-handed neutrino number is generated, which then converts to a net
baryon asymmetry via sphalerons. A lower limit on the expected initial value of
the scalar field translates to a lower limit on the baryon to entropy ratio
(which also depends on the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling). Consistency with
the limits on baryonic isocurvature perturbations requires that the spectral
index of adiabatic perturbations produced during inflation be very close to
unity. In a variant of our scenario in which the scalar is a gauge singlet, the
connection between the baryon to entropy ratio and the inflationary scale is
lost, although the basic mechanism of baryogenesis remains applicable.

The lightest neutralino is the wino which is a perfect cold dark matter

gluon mass M lead to a precise specification of the long-range non-relativistic
part of the potential binding the gluon to the quarks with no undetermined
phenomenological parameters, in the limit of large interquark separation R. Our
major tool (also used earlier by Simonov) is the use of proper-time methods to
describe gluon propagation within the quark system, which reveals the gluon
Wilson line as a composite of co-located quark and antiquark lines. We show
that (aside from color-Coulomb and similar terms) the gluon potential energy in
the presence of quarks is accurately described via attaching these three
strings to the gluon, which in equilibrium sits at the middle of the Y-shaped
string network joining the three quarks. The gluon undergoes small harmonic
fluctuations that slightly stretch these strings and quasi-confine the gluon to
the neighborhood of the middle. In the non-relativistic limit (large R) we use
the Schrodinger equation, ignoring mixing with l=2 states. Relativistic
corrections (smaller R) are applied with a variational principle for the
relativistic harmonic oscillator. We also consider the role of color-Coulomb
contributions. We find leading non-relativistic large-R terms in the gluon
string energy which behave like the square root of K/(MR). The relativistic
energy goes like the cube root of K/R. We get an acceptable fit to lattice data
with M = 500 MeV. We show that in the quark-antiquark hybrid the gluon is a
bead that can slide without friction on a string joining the quark and
anti-quark. We comment briefly on the significance of our findings to

We revise WT theory using a generalisation of the random phase approximation

the amplitudes of the wave Fourier modes are random quantities and it is called
the ``Random Phase and Amplitude'' approach. This approach allows to
systematically derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum from the the
Peierls-Brout-Prigogine (PBP) equation for the multi-mode probability density
function (PDF). The PBP equation was originally derived for the three-wave
systems and in the present paper we derive a similar equation for the four-wave
case. Equation for the multi-mode PDF will be used to validate the statistical
assumptions about the phase and the amplitude randomness used for WT closures.
Further, the multi-mode PDF contains a detailed statistical information, beyond
spectra, and it finally allows to study non-Gaussianity and intermittency in
WT, as it will be described in the present paper. In particular, we will show
that intermittency of stochastic nonlinear waves is related to a flux of

ensembles of weakly interacting waves, commonly called Wave Turbulence. In its
traditional formulation, RPA assumes that phases of interacting waves are
random quantities but it usually ignores randomness of their amplitudes.
Recently, RPA was generalised in a way that takes into account the amplitude
randomness and it was applied to study of the higher momenta and probability
densities of wave amplitudes. However, to have a meaningful description of wave
turbulence the RPA properties assumed for the initial fields must be proven to
survive over the nonlinear evolution time, and such a proof is the main goal of
the present paper. We derive an evolution equation for the full probability
density function which contains the complete information about the joint
statistics of all wave amplitudes and phases. We show that, for any initial
statistics of the amplitudes, the phase factors remain statistically
independent uniformly distributed variables. If in addition the initial
amplitudes are also independent variables (but with arbitrary distributions)
they will remain independent when considered in small sets which are much less
than the total number of modes. However, if the size of a set is of order of
the total number of modes then the joint probability density for this set is
not factorisable into the product of one-mode probabilities. In the other
words, the modes in such a set are involved in a ``collective'' (correlated)
motion. We also study new type of correlators describing the phase statistics.

neither negative-energy states for $E=-1$, nor symmetry between the $l = j -

present any degeneracy pattern apart from that associated with the rotational

between the $l = j - {1/2}$ states corresponding to small, intermediate and
very large $j$ values in the sense that only for the first ones supersymmetry
remains unbroken, while for the second ones no bound state does exist.

neutrino momentum, and the measurement of the beta-neutrino correlation, in a
more direct fashion than previously possible. The beta-neutrino correlation

Namely: 1) sublevels of the fine structure are defined by an additional quantum
number: product of helicity of the wave and its orbital moment; 2) for a
waveguide with a parabolic profile of the refractive index each level of the
scalar approximation splits into N sublevels (N is the principal quantum
number), while for any other profile it splits into 2 sublevels; 3) each level
of the fine structure remains twice degenerated due to local axial symmetry of

retraction is powered by a strong molecular motor protein, PilT, producing very
high forces that can exceed 150 pN. The molecular details of the motor
mechanism are still largely unknown, while other features have been identified,
such as the ring-shaped protein structure of the PilT motor. The surprisingly
high forces generated by the PilT system motivate a model investigation of the
generation of large forces in molecular motors. We propose a simple model,
involving a small ensemble of motor subunits interacting through the
deformations on a circular backbone with finite stiffness. The model describes
the motor subunits in terms of diffusing particles in an asymmetric,
time-dependent binding potential (flashing ratchet potential), roughly
corresponding to the ATP hydrolysis cycle. We compute force-velocity relations
in a subset of the parameter space and explore how the maximum force (stall
force) is determined by stiffness, binding strength, ensemble size, and degree
of asymmetry. We identify two qualitatively different regimes of operation
depending on the relation between ensemble size and asymmetry. In the
transition between these two regimes, the stall force depends nonlinearly on
the number of motor subunits. Compared to its constituents without
interactions, we find higher efficiency and qualitatively different
force-velocity relations. The model captures several of the qualitative
features obtained in experiments on pilus retraction forces, such as roughly
constant velocity at low applied forces and insensitivity in the stall force to
changes in the ATP concentration.

Opt. 7 (2005) 293--299","10.1088/1464-4266/7/9/010",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we consider an alternative formulation of a class of stochastic
wave and master equations with scalar noise that are used in quantum optics for
modelling open systems and continuously monitored systems. The reformulation is
obtained by applying J.M.C. Clark's pathwise reformulation technique from the
theory of classical nonlinear filtering. The pathwise versions of the
stochastic wave and master equations are defined for all driving paths and
depend continuously on them. In the case of white noise equations, we derive
analogs of Clark's robust approximations. The results in this paper may be
useful for implementing filters for the continuous monitoring and measurement
feedback control of quantum systems, and for developing new types of numerical
methods for unravelling master equations. The main ideas are illustrated by an
example.

develop a low temperature expansion for general spin chains. We then apply this

We show that optimal times for extraction of output states are almost
independent of the temperature which lowers only the fidelity of the channel.
Moreover we show that thermal effects are smaller in the anti-ferromagnetic
chains than the ferromagnetic ones.

the mathematical formalization is given of the idea that an instrument is a
channel which accepts a quantum state as input and produces a probability and
an a posteriori state as output. Then, by using mutual entropies on von Neumann
algebras and the identification of instruments and channels, many old and new
informational inequalities are obtained in a unified manner. Such inequalities
involve various quantities which characterize the performances of the
instrument under study; in particular, these inequalities include and
generalize the famous Holevo's bound.

  probability","4 pages, no figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Grover's algorithm is one of the most important quantum algorithms, which
performs the task of searching an unsorted database without a priori
probability. Recently the adiabatic evolution has been used to design and
reproduce quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm. In this paper, we
show that quantum search algorithm by adiabatic evolution has two properties
that conventional quantum search algorithm doesn't have. Firstly, we show that
in the initial state of the algorithm only the amplitude of the basis state
corresponding to the solution affects the running time of the algorithm, while
other amplitudes do not. Using this property, if we know a priori probability
about the location of the solution before search, we can modify the adiabatic
evolution to make the algorithm faster. Secondly, we show that by a factor for
the initial and finial Hamiltonians we can reduce the running time of the
algorithm arbitrarily. Especially, we can reduce the running time of adiabatic
search algorithm to a constant time independent of the size of the database.
The second property can be extended to other adiabatic algorithms.

describing entanglement of the block with the rest of the chain, is computed.
Recent calculations have revealed that the entropy in the XX model diverges
logarithmically with the size of the subsystem. We show that the presence of
the energy current increases the prefactor of the logarithmic growth. This
result indicates that the emergence of the energy current gives rise to an
increase of entanglement.

in reconstruction of optical objects from diffraction-limited images. Taking as
example of an input object two closely spaced Gaussian peaks we demonstrate
that one can improve the resolution in the reconstructed object over the
classical Rayleigh limit. We show that the ultimate quantum limit of resolution
in such reconstruction procedure is determined not by diffraction but by the
signal-to-noise ratio in the input object. We formulate a quantitative measure
of super-resolution in terms of the optical point-spread function of the
system.

bounds for the lowest energy is presented. Unlike perturbative or variational
techniques, this method does not involve the computation of any integral (a
normalisation factor or a matrix element). It just requires the determination
of the absolute minimum and maximum in the whole configuration space of the
local energy associated with a normalisable trial function (the calculation of
the norm is not needed). After a general introduction, the method is applied to
three non-integrable systems: the asymmetric annular billiard, the many-body
spinless Coulombian problem, the hydrogen atom in a constant and uniform
magnetic field. Being more sensitive than the variational methods to any local
perturbation of the trial function, this method can used to systematically
improve the energy bounds with a local skilled analysis; an algorithm relying
on this method can therefore be constructed and an explicit example for a
one-dimensional problem is given.
