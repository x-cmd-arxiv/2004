(MANETs) used by routing protocols to discover routes and in group
communication operations. NWB is commonly performed via flooding, which has
been shown to be expensive in dense MANETs because of its high redundancy.
Several efforts have targeted reducing the redundancy of floods. In this work,
we target another problem that can substantially impact the success of NWBs:
since MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, it is possible for critical
rebroadcasts to be lost, leading to a significant drop in the node coverage.
This is especially true under heavy load and in sparse topologies. We show that
the techniques that target reducing the overhead of flooding, reduce its
inherent redundancy and harm its reliability. In addition, we show that static
approaches are more vulnerable to this problem. We then present a selective
rebroadcast approach to improve the robustness of NWBs. We show that our
approach leads to considerable improvement in NWB coverage relative to a
recently proposed solution to this problem, with a small increase in overhead.
The proposed approaches do not require proactive neighbor discovery and are
therefore resilient to mobility. Finally, the solution can be added to
virtually all NWB approaches to improve their reliability.

from the exponential Laplace Sum Rules (LSR). We do not find any sum rule
window for extracting optimal and reliable results from the LSR, due to the
unusual slow convergence of the OPE and to the exceptional important role of
the QCD continuum into the spectral function in this channel. Instead, we use
in this channel,for the first time, Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR), which
exhibit a nice stability in the QCD continuum threshold t_c, at which one can
extract, with a good accuracy, the mass of the lowest resonance. Including the
D=7, 9 condensate contributions in the OPE, we obtain M_Theta=(1513+- 114) MeV,
and the corresponding residue lambda_Theta^2= -(0.14-- 0.49)x 10^{-9} GeV^{12},
which favours the I=0, J=1/2, and negative parity S-wave interpretation of the
Theta (1540). However, our analysis indicates a degeneracy between the unmixed
I=0 and I=1 S-wave states. In the I=0, J=1/2, P-wave channel, we obtain, for
the P-resonance, M_P = (1.99+- 0.19) GeV and lambda_P= -(0.7--7.1)x 10^{-9}
GeV^{14}, which we expect to be discovered experimentally. Our results also
suggest that some intuitive choices of the continuum threshold used in the LSR
literature are inconsistent with the FESR results. Finally, a study of the
Theta-K-N coupling using a vertex sum rule shows that, for the I=0, S-wave
channel, the leading OPE contributions only start to order alpha_s^2 in the
chiral limit m_s=0, indicating that the Theta is very narrow.
