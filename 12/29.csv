been demonstrated that interstellar scintillation (ISS) is the principal cause
of such rapid variability. Observations of ISS can be used to probe very
compact, microarcsecond-scale structure in quasar inner jets, as well as
properties of turbulence in the local Galactic ISM. A few sources show
unusually rapid, intra-hour variations, evidently due to scattering in very
nearby, localized turbulence. We present recent findings for the rapidly
scintillating quasar PKS 1257-326. The large-scale MASIV VLA Survey showed that

us to derive their three-dimensional distributions of velocity, emissivity and

kinematics with measurements of the external pressure and density derived from
Chandra observations, we can also determine the jet dynamics via a
conservation-law approach. The result is a detailed and quantitative picture of
jet deceleration. We discuss the potential application of these techniques on
VLBI scales. Our fundamental assumption is that the jets are intrinsically
symmetrical, axisymmetric, relativistic flows. Although this is likely to be a
good approximation on average, the effects of non-stationarity in the flow
(e.g. shocks/knots) may limit its applicability on pc scales. We also stress
the need for both the main and counter-jet to be detected with good transverse
resolution in linear polarization as well as total intensity. Two foreground
effects (free-free absorption and Faraday rotation) must also be corrected. We
comment on the implications of observed VLBI polarization and Faraday rotation
for the field structure (and, by implication, collimation) of pc-scale jets.
Where our VLA observations start to resolve the jets, about 1 kpc from the
nucleus, they are travelling at about 0.8c. We briefly discuss the deceleration
of jets from a much faster initial speed.

expected, especially at the fainter radio flux density levels, where star
forming galaxies are thought to dominate both the radio and mid-IR source
counts. Spitzer detects many sources that have no counter-part in the radio.

a rescaled payoff matrix described by a single parameter Tau, which measures
the ratio of 'temptation to defect' to 'reward for cooperation'. Depending on
the region of the parameter space Tau, the system self-organizes - after a

channels with random states (e.g., slow fading channels) so as to minimize the
average distortion. The general problem is unsolved. Hence, we focus on
comparing two commonly used source and channel encoding systems which
correspond to exploiting diversity either at the physical layer through
parallel channel coding or at the application layer through multiple
description source coding.
  For on-off channel models, source coding diversity offers better performance.
For channels with a continuous range of reception quality, we show the reverse
is true. Specifically, we introduce a new figure of merit called the distortion
exponent which measures how fast the average distortion decays with SNR. For
continuous-state models such as additive white Gaussian noise channels with
multiplicative Rayleigh fading, optimal channel coding diversity at the
physical layer is more efficient than source coding diversity at the
application layer in that the former achieves a better distortion exponent.
  Finally, we consider a third decoding architecture: multiple description
encoding with a joint source-channel decoding. We show that this architecture
achieves the same distortion exponent as systems with optimal channel coding
diversity for continuous-state channels, and maintains the the advantages of
multiple description systems for on-off channels. Thus, the multiple
description system with joint decoding achieves the best performance, from
among the three architectures considered, on both continuous-state and on-off
channels.

has finite size the observed radiation will occur during some finite time. Its
redshift and bending angle are affected by the strong gravitational field. We
obtain a simple expression for the observed flux of the radiation as a function
of time. To find an explicit expression for the flux we develop an analytical
approximation for the bending angle and time delay for null rays emitted by a
collapsing surface. In the case of the bending angle this approximation is an
improved version of the earlier proposed Beloborodov-Leahy-approximation. For
rays emitted at $R > 2R_g$ the accuracy of the proposed improved approximations
for the bending angle and time delay is of order (or less) than 2-3%. By using
this approximation we obtain an approximate analytical expression for the
observed flux and study its properties.

employ a simple geometric algorithm which enables us to ""solve"" the Ansatz
including all three CP violating phases. Specifically, given the known neutrino
oscillation data and an assumed two parameter (the third neutrino mass $m_3$
and the Dirac CP phase $\delta$) family of inputs we predict the neutrino
masses and Majorana CP phases. Despite the two parameter ambiguity, interesting
statements emerge.
  There is a characteristic pattern of interconnected masses and CP phases. For
large $m_3$ the three neutrinos are approximately degenerate. The only
possibility for a mass hierarchy is to have $m_3$ smaller than the other two. A
hierarchy with $m_3$ largest is not allowed.
  Small CP violation is possible only near two special values of $m_3$. Also,
the neutrinoless double beta decay parameter is approximately bounded as 0.020

the scaling exponents characterizing its scaling behavior when approaching the
thermodynamic limit. For this, we use a simple model of coexistence of hadronic
gas and color-singlet Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases in a finite volume. The
Color-Singlet Partition Function (CSPF) of the QGP cannot be exactly calculated
and is usually derived within the saddle point approximation. When we try to do
calculations with such an approximate CSPF, a problem arises in the limit of
small temperatures and/or volumes (VT3<<1), requiring then additional
approximations if we want to carry out calculations. We propose in this work a
new method for an accurate calculation of any quantity of the finite system,
without explicitly calculating the CSPF itself and without any approximation.
By probing the behavior of some useful thermodynamic response functions on the
hole range of temperature, it turns out that in a finite size system, all
singularities in the thermodynamic limit are smeared out and the transition
point is shifted away. A numerical finite size scaling analysis of the obtained
data allows us to determine the scaling exponents of the QCD DPT. Our results
expressing the equality between their values and the space dimensionality is a
consequence of the singularity characterizing a first order phase transition
and agree very well with the predictions of other FSS theoretical approaches
and with the results of both lattice QCD and Monte Carlo models calculations.

calculated binding energy of the alpha particle differs by ~1 MeV from

"physics/0412174","Liqiang Wei","Liqiang Wei","Single-Particle Green Function Approach and Correlated Atomic or
  Molecular Orbitals",,,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.other cond-mat.soft physics.atm-clus",,"  In this paper, we propose a generic and systematic approach for study of the
electronic structure for atoms or molecules. In particular, we address the
issue of single particle states, or orbitals, which should be one of the most
important aspects of a quantum many-body theory. We argue that the
single-particle $\it{Green}$ function provides a most general scheme for
generating these single particle states or orbitals. We call them the
$\it{correlated}$ atomic or molecular orbitals to make a distinction from those
determined from $\it{Hartree-Fock}$ equation. We present the calculation of the
single particle properties (i.e., the electron affinities $(EA's)$ and
ionization potentials $(IP's)$) for the $H_{2}O$ molecule using the correlated
molecular orbitals in the context of quantum chemistry with a second-order self
energy. We also calculate the total ground state energy with a single $Slater$
wavefunction determined only from the hole states. Comparisons are made with
available experimental data as well as with those from the $\it{Hartree-Fock}$
or density functional theory $(DFT)$ calculations. We conclude that the
correlated atomic or molecular orbital approach provides a strictest and most
powerful method for studying the single-particle properties of atoms or
molecules. It also gives a better total energy than do the $\it{Hartree-Fock}$
and $\it{DFT}$ even at the single $\it{Slater}$ determinant level. It promises
that a correlation theory based on the correlated atomic or molecular orbitals
will become an approach which possesses the advantages and also overcomes their
shortcomings of current quantum chemistry methods based on either the
conventional quantum many-body theory or the $DFT$.

genetic network and robust dependencies underlying differentiation. The data
considered is in the form of a binary matrix and represent the expression of
the nine genes across the ninety-nine colonies. The report is divided into two
parts: the first part identifies significant pair-wise dependencies from the
given binary matrix using linear correlation and mutual information. A new
method is proposed to determine statistically significant dependencies
estimated using the mutual information measure. In the second, a Bayesian
approach is used to obtain an approximate description (equivalence class) of
network structures. The robustness of linear correlation, mutual information
and the equivalence class of networks is investigated with perturbation and
decreasing colony number. Perturbation of the data was achieved by generating
bootstrap realizations. The results are refined with biological knowledge. It
was found that certain dependencies in the network are immune to perturbation
and decreasing colony number and may represent robust features, inherent in the
differentiation program of osteoblast progenitor cells. The methods to be
discussed are generic in nature and not restricted to the experimental paradigm
addressed in this study.

serve as a source of light with nonclassical properties. Properties of the
generated fields are substantially modified by scattering of the nonlinearly
interacting fields in a photonic band-gap structure inside the waveguide. A
quantum model of linear operator amplitude corrections to amplitude mean-values
provides conditions for an efficient squeezed-light generation as well as
generation of light with sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics. Destructive
influence of phase mismatch of the nonlinear interaction can fully be
compensated using a suitable photonic-band gap structure inside the waveguide.
Also an increase of signal-to-noise ratio of an incident optical field can be
reached in the waveguide.

the quantum optics experiment of Pan et al. By presenting a model that operates
on independent computers, we show that this belief is unfounded. Three remote
computers (Alice, Bob and Claire), that never communicate with each other, send
measurement results to a fourth computer that is in charge of collecting the
data and computing correlations. The result obtained by our local simulation is
in better agreement with the ideal quantum result than the Pan et al.
experiment. We also show that the local model presented by Pan et al. that can
not explain the quantum results contains inappropriate reasoning with profound
consequences for the possible results of any local model that uses probability
theory.

are equivalent to monotonicity under local operations and classical

invariance under adding local ancilla in arbitrary state 3) on mixtures of
states possessing local orthogonal flags the function is equal to its average.
The result holds for multipartite systems. It is intriguing that the obtained
conditions are equalities. The only inequality is hidden in the condition of
convexity.
