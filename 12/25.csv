model in which the phantom field has interaction with the dark matter. We
discuss the existence and stability of scaling solutions for two types of
specific interactions. One is motivated by the conformal transformation in
string theory and the other is motivated by analogy with dissipation. In the
former case, there exist no scaling solutions. In the latter case, there exist
stable scaling solutions, which may give a phenomenological solution of the
coincidence problem. Furthermore, the universe either accelerates forever or
ends with a singularity, which is determined by not only the model parameters
but also the initial velocity of the phantom field.

  explosions","26 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J. 623 (2005) 1000-1010","10.1086/428496",,"astro-ph",,"  In order to infer the effects of rotation on the revival of a stalled shock
in supernova explosions, we investigated steady accretion flows with a standing
shock. We first obtained a series of solutions for equations describing
non-rotating spherically symmetric flows and confirmed the results of preceding
papers that, for a given mass accretion rate, there is a critical luminosity of
irradiating neutrinos, above which there exists no steady solution. Below the
critical value, we found two branches of solutions; one is stable and the other
is unstable against radial perturbations. With a simple argument based on the
Riemann problem, we can identify the critical luminosity as the one, at which
the stalled shock revives. We also obtained the condition satisfied by the flow
velocity for the critical luminosity, which can be easily applied to the
rotational case. If a collapsing star rotates, the accretion flow is
non-spherical due to centrifugal forces. Flows are accelerated near the
rotation axis whereas they are decelerated near the equatorial plane. As a
result, the critical luminosity is lowered, that is, rotation assists the
revival of a stalled shock. According to our calculations, the critical
luminosity is $\sim25$% lower for the mass accretion rate of 1M$_{\odot}$/sec
and the rotation frequency of 0.1 Hz at a radius of 1000 km than that of the
spherically symmetric flow with the same mass accretion rate. We found that the
condition of the flow velocity at the critical luminosity is first satisfied at
the rotation axis. This suggests that the shock revival is triggered on the
rotation axis and a jet-like explosion ensues.

the formation of a set of ferromagnetically correlated regions localized near
impurities (bound magnetic polarons). At finite temperatures, the magnetic
structure of the chain was calculated simultaneously with the wave function of
a conduction electron bound by an impurity. The calculations were performed
using an approximate variational method and a Monte Carlo simulation. Both
these methods give similar results. The analysis of the temperature dependence
of correlation functions for neighboring local spins demonstrated that the
ferromagnetic correlations inside a magnetic polaron remain significant even
above the N\'eel temperature $T_N$ implying rather high stability of the
magnetic polaron state. In the case when the electron-impurity coupling energy
$V$ is not too high (for $V$ lower that the electron hopping integral $t$), the
magnetic polaron could be depinned from impurity retaining its magnetic
structure. Such a depinning occurs at temperatures of the order of $T_N$. At
even higher temperatures ($T \sim t$) magnetic polarons disappear and the chain
becomes completely disordered.

\epsilon a small parameter. We study the measures which are the limits of the

  In the case of a general MS field $b$, such a limit measures is the sum of a
linear combination of Dirac measures located at the singular point of $b$ and a
linear combination of measures supported by the limit cycles of b.
  When b is a MS-gradient vector field, we use a Blow-up analysis to determine
how the sequence concentrates on the critical point set. We prove that the set
of critical points that a critical point belongs to the support of a limit
measure only if the Topological Pressure defined by a variational problem is
achieved there. Also if a sequence converges to a measure in such a way that
every critical points is a limit point of global maxima of the eigenfunction,

stress, \dot\epsilon: shear rate) of the samples stored (gelatinized) at
20^{\circ}C for 10min after the addition of NaOH solution with the normality
0.090 - 0.175N, were measured by a cone-plate type rotational viscometer. For
the flow analysis a care was taken for the ambiguity of the analysis range of
flow data. The samples added with 0.14 - 0.16N NaOH displayed an apparently
dilatant flow. As the normality of added NaOH increased, apparent viscosity
\eta_a was steeply enhanced in the vicinity of 0.14N and started to grow almost
exponentially. Next, the storage time dependence of flow properties was
investigated for samples gelatinized for 6<t[min]<230 after the addition of
0.146N NaOH solution. A Newtonian analysis of the flow (\sigma - \dot\epsilon)
data indicated that viscosity \eta increased exponentially in the early stage
(6<t<35) and did linearly in the middle. It was argued that the observed time
dependence of viscosity could be described by a first-order reaction hypothesis
combined with the fluidity (\eta^{-1}) mixing rule with respect to
ungelatinized and gelatinized fractions of starch. The application of this
theoretical treatment to the present data suggested that the gelatinization
process was composed of plural phases with different values of a rate constant.
For the observed kinetic characteristic of alkali gelatinization, the
discussions were presented on the basis of amylose complex formation.
