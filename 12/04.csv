above 5 sigma, this catalogue of submm galaxies (SMGs) is significantly more
robust than previous samples, typically selected above 3.0-3.5 sigma, with a
much-reduced likelihood of real, faint SMGs (beneath and around the confusion
limit) entering the catalogue via superposition with noise. Our selection
technique yields 19 SMGs of which we expect at most two to be due to chance
superposition of SCUBA and MAMBO noise peaks. The flux limit of the sample
(~5mJy at 0.85mm), which is sensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme
redshifts, is optimally matched to a deep 1.4-GHz image (4.6 uJy/beam rms)
which probes starbursts in the z<~4 regime. A high fraction of these robust
SMGs (~80%) have radio counterparts which, given the probable ~10%
contamination by spurious sources, suggests that very distant SMGs (z>~3-4) are
unlikely to make up more than ~10% of the bright SMG population. Finally, the
accurate radio positions are used to test the accuracy of positions determined
in the submm, with important implications for upcoming surveys with SCUBA-2.

analysis to study the propagation of acoustic waves along coronal loops. We
show that the intensity perturbation of a wave depends on a number of factors,
including dissipation of the wave energy, pressure and temperature gradients in
the loop atmosphere, work action between the wave and a flow, and the
sensitivity properties of the observing instrument. In particular, the scale
length of the intensity perturbation varies directly with the dissipation scale
length (i.e., damping length) and the scale lengths of pressure, temperature,
and velocity. We simulate wave propagation in three different equilibrium loop
models and find that dissipation and pressure and temperature stratification
are the most important effects in the low corona where the waves are most
easily detected. Velocity effects are small, and cross-sectional area
variations play no direct role for lines-of-sight that are normal to the loop
axis. The intensity perturbation scale lengths in our simulations agree very
well with the scale lengths we measure in a sample of loops observed by TRACE.
The median observed value is 4.35x10^9 cm. In some cases the intensity
perturbation increases with height, which is likely an indication of a
temperature inversion in the loop (i.e., temperature that decreases with
height). Our most important conclusion is that thermal conduction, the primary
damping mechanism, is accurately described by classical transport theory. There
is no need to invoke anomalous processes to explain the observations.

view of the cosmological model: namely the power law Lambda-CDM. The recent
WMAP results comfort this new standard model. Nevertheless, some degeneracy in
the CMB physics do not allow one to exclude alternative models. A combined
analysis with other cosmological observations is thus needed. An example of
such work is shown here, focusing on the abundance of local clusters. The
latter is a traditional way to derive the amplitude of matter fluctuations, but
which suffers from a lack of accurate knowledge of their masses. Here we show
that the mass temperature relation can be specified for any cosmological model
from consistency arguments, removing most of this uncertainty. This allows to
obtain an estimation of the amplitude of matter fluctuations with an accuracy
of 5%. Quite remarkably, this amplitude can be also tightly constrained from
existing CMB measurements. However, the amplitude inferred in this way in a
concordance model (Lambda-CDM) is significantly larger than the value derived
from x-ray clusters. Such a discrepancy may reveal the existence of a new dark
component in the Universe. It may alternatively reveal a significant depletion
of the gas during the formation of clusters. In all cases, an essential element
of clusters formation history seems to be missing.

polarization state of a light beam is described by a tensor constructed from
the time average of quadratic products of the electric field components in a

ideal for calculations involving the boosting of polarized light beams between
Lorentz frames, and is more flexible than the traditional Stokes parameter
approach in which a separate set of polarization basis vectors is required for
each photon. The covariant kinetic equation for Compton scattering of partially
polarized light by relativistic electrons is obtained in the tensor formalism

Accepted for publication in ApJ","Astrophys.J. 622 (2005) 235-243","10.1086/427867",,"astro-ph",,"  The mid-infrared (10-20 um) luminosity of elliptical galaxies is dominated by
the integrated emission from circumstellar dust in red giant stars. As a single
stellar population evolves, the rate of dusty mass loss from red giant stars
decreases with time, so the mid-infrared luminosity should also decline with
stellar age. To seek such a correlation, we have used archival ISO observations
to determine surface brightness profiles and central fluxes at 15 um in 17
early-type galaxies for which stellar ages have been determined from optical
spectral indices. The radial surface brightness distributions at 15 um
generally follow the stellar de Vaucouleurs profile as expected. We find that
the surface brightness ratio mu_{15um}/mu_{I-band} is systematically higher in
elliptical galaxies with ages < 5 Gyrs and in galaxies that exhibit evidence of
recent mergers. Within the accuracy of our observations, mu_{15um}/mu_{I-band}
shows no age dependence for ages > 5 Gyrs. The corresponding flux ratios
F_{15um}/F_{I-band} within apertures scaled to the effective radius (R_e/8) are
proportional to the mu_{15um}/mu_{I-band} ratios at larger galactic radii,
indicating that no 15 um emission is detected from central dust clouds visible
in optical images in some of our sample galaxies. Emission at 15 um is observed
in non-central massive clouds of dust and cold gas in NGC1316, an elliptical
galaxy that is thought to have had a recent merger. Recent {\it Spitzer Space
Telescope} data also indicate the presence of PAH emission at 8 um. Several
ellipticals have extended regions of 15 um emission that have no obvious
counterparts at other frequencies.

of initial metal content from Z=0.01 to 0.03, and include metallicity
enhancements within the stellar convection zone corresponding to
Delta-Z=0.005-0.03. We find that the primary effects of metal enhancement on
stellar structure and evolution are expansion of the convection zone and
downward shift of effective temperature. In addition, we have computed the

of pollution; there appears to be no correlation with present observational

  briefly","Astrophys.J. 628 (2005) 298-314","10.1086/430693",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper, within the popular internal shock scenario of GRBs, we
calculate the early optical afterglow lightcurves of a neutron-fed GRB fireball
for different assumed neutron fractions in the fireball and for both ISM- and
wind-interaction models. The cases for both long and short GRBs are considered.
We show that as long as the neutron fraction is significant (e.g. the number of
neutrons is comparable to that of protons), rich afterglow signatures would
show up. For a constant density (ISM) model, a neutron-rich early afterglow is
characterized by a slowly rising lightcurve followed by a sharp re-brightening
bump caused by collision between the leading neutron decay trail ejecta and the
trailing ion ejecta. For a massive star stellar-wind model, the neutron-rich
early afterglow shows an extended plateau lasting for about 100 seconds before
the lightcurve starts to decay. The plateau is mainly attributed to the
emission from the unshocked neutron decay trail. When the overlapping of the
initial prompt $\gamma-$rays with the shocks and the trail is important, as is
common for the wind model and is also possible in the ISM model under some
conditions, the IC cooling effect suppresses the very early optical afterglow
significantly, making the neutron-fed signature dimmer. For short GRBs powered
by compact star mergers, a neutron-decay-induced step-like re-brightening is
predicted, although the amplitude is not large. All these neutron-fed
signatures are likely detectable by the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) on
board the {\em Swift} observatory if GRB fireballs are indeed baryonic and
neutron-rich. Close monitoring of early afterglows from 10s to 1000s of
seconds, when combined with detailed theoretical modeling, could be used to
potentially diagnose the existence of the neutron component in GRB fireballs.

The approach is based on a fully vectorial treatment of the generalized kinetic

coherent gain are implemented exactly by novel, additional terms in the WI. As
a result of resonant (Mie) scattering from the individual scatterers, all

being a version of EM, inside-outside estimation also inherits the good
convergence behavior of EM. Therefore, the as yet imperfect line of
argumentation can be transformed into a coherent proof.

key goal of any framework is to allow people to more easily express, explore,
and communicate ideas, and hence, we illustrate how our framework can be used
to describe a variety of commonly used patterns, such as frequent patterns,
frequent closed patterns, indirect association patterns, hub patterns and
authority patterns. To further illustrate the usefulness of the framework, we
also present two new kinds of patterns that derived from the framework: clique
pattern and bi-clique pattern and illustrate their practical use.

Both hard and soft mechanisms provide universal dependence of the partial
amplitude of the high energy elastic hadron- hadron scattering on the impact
parameter ${\bf b}$ and result in the radius of interaction proportional to
$\ln (s/s_0)$. We find that with increase of the collision energies hard
interactions lead to a faster increase of the impact parameter range where the
partial wave amplitudes are approaching the unitarity limit. Consequently, we
argue that at super high energies whenthe radius of hadronic interactions
significantly exceeds static radii of the interacting hadrons(nuclei) the ratio
of total cross sections of nucleon-nucleon, meson-nucleon, hadron-nucleus,
nucleus-nucleus collisions becomes equal to one. The same universality is also
expected for the structure functions of nuclei: $F_{2 A}(x,Q^2)/F_{2 N}(x,Q^2)>
\to 1$, at very small $x$, and for the ratio $>\sigma_{gamma
A}/>\sigma_{>\gamma p}\to 1$ at superhigh energies. We analyze how accounting
for the energy dependence of the interaction radii changes the geometry of
hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, the energy dependence of total,
absorption and inelastic cross sections, the distribution over the number of
wounded nucleons in proton-nucleus collisions and find that these effects are
noticeable already for the LHC energies and even more so close to the

chiral symmetry breaking. A special solution of QCD is involved, with a
high-energy S-Matrix that can be constructed ``semi-perturbatively'' via the
chiral anomaly and reggeon diagrams. An infra-red fixed point and color
superconductivity are crucial components of the construction. Infinite momentum
physical states contain both quarks and a universal ``anomalous wee gluon''
component, and the spectrum is more limited than is required by confinement and
chiral symmetry breaking. The pomeron is approximately a regge pole and the
Critical Pomeron describes asymptotic cross-sections.
  The strong coupling of the pomeron to the electroweak sector could produce
large $x$ and $Q^2$ events at HERA, and vector boson pairs at Fermilab. Further
evidence for the sextet sector at Fermilab would be a large $E_T$ jet excess,
due in part to the non-evolution of ${\alpha}_s$, and other phenomena related
to the possibility that top quark production is due to the $\eta_6$.
  The sextet proton and neutron are the only new baryonic states. Sextet states
dominate high energy hadronic cross-sections and stable sextet neutrons could
produce both dark matter and ultra high energy cosmic rays. The cosmic ray
spectrum knee suggests the effective sextet threshold is between Fermilab and
LHC energies, with large cross-section effects expected at the LHC. Jet and
vector boson cross-sections will be very much larger than expected, and sextet
baryons should also be produced. Double pomeron produced states could provide
definitive evidence for the existence of the sextet sector in the initial low

significant fraction of the energy density from annihilation will be deposited
on the Standard Model brane, even if it is separated from the inflationary
throat by being in some more deeply warped throat. This is due to the
exponential growth of the massive Kaluza-Klein wave functions toward the
infrared ends of the throats. We argue that the possibility of this process
removes a conceptual obstacle to the construction of multi-throat models,
wherein inflation occurs in a different throat than the one in which the
Standard Model brane resides. Such multi-throat models are desirable because
they can help to reconcile the scale of inflation with the supersymmetry
breaking scale on the Standard Model brane, and because they can allow cosmic
strings to be sufficiently long-lived to be observable during the present
epoch.

independence of the results requires assuming that at the quantum level
supergauge invariance is not broken by nonanticommutative geometry. In this
paper we use an alternative approach which allows studying these theories in a
manifestly gauge independent superspace setup. This is accomplished by
generalizing the background field method to the NAC case, by moving to a
momentum superspace where star products are treated as exponential factors and
by developing momentum supergraph techniques. We compute the one--loop gauge
effective action for NAC U(N) gauge theories with matter in the adjoint
representation. Despite the appearance of divergent contributions which break
(super)gauge invariance, we prove that the effective action at this order is

recently built and begun to operate the world's first Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD)network under DARPA sponsorship. The DARPA Quantum Network became fully
operational on October 23, 2003 in BBN's laboratories, and in June 2004 was
fielded through dark fiber under the streets of Cambridge, Mass., to link our
campuses with non-stop quantum cryptography, twenty-four hours per day. As of
December 2004, it consists of six nodes. Four are 5 MHz, BBN-built BB84 systems
designed for telecommunications fiber and inter-connected by a photonic switch.
Two are the electronics subsystems for a high speed free-space system designed
and built by NIST. This paper describes the motivation for our work, the
current status of the DARPA Quantum Network, its unique optical switching and
key relay protocols, and our future plans.

  316--329, Plenum, 1976",,,"quant-ph",,"  We consider two variants of a quantum-statistical generalization of the
Cramer-Rao inequality that establishes an invariant lower bound on the mean
square error of a generalized quantum measurement. The proposed complex variant
of this inequality leads to a precise formulation of a generalized uncertainty
principle for arbitrary states, in contrast to Helstrom's symmetric variant in
which these relations are obtained only for pure states. A notion of canonical
states is introduced and the lower mean square error bound is found for
estimating of the parameters of canonical states, in particular, the canonical
parameters of a Lie group. It is shown that these bounds are globally
attainable only for canonical states for which there exist efficient
measurements or quasimeasurements.

  and Technology in the USSR, Mir Publisher 1988",,,"quant-ph",,"  We give a review of the most important results on optimal tomography as
mathematical wave-pattern recognition theory emerged in the 70's in connection
with the problems of optimal estimation and hypothesis testing in quantum
theory. In quantum theory such problems are sometimes referred as the problem
of optimal measurement of an unknown quantum state, and are the main subject of
the emerging mathematical theory of quantum statistics.
  We develop the results of quantum pattern recognition theory, most of which
belong to VPB, further into the direction of wave, rather than particle
statistical estimation and hypothesis testing theory, with the aim to include
not only quantum matter waves but also classical wave patterns like optical and
acoustic waves. We conclude that Hilbert space and operator methods developed
in quantum theory are equally useful in the classical wave theory, as soon as
the possible observations are restricted to only intensity distributions of
waves, i.e. when the wave states are not the allowed observables, as they are
not the observables of individual particles in the quantum theory. We show that
all characteristic attributes of quantum theory such as complementarity,
entanglement or Heisenberg uncertainty relations are also attributes of the
generalized wave pattern recognition theory.

of semi-direct product groups $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_q$, for p and
q prime. We first present a classification of these groups in five classes.
Then, we describe a polynomial-time quantum algorithm solving the HSP over all
the groups of one of these classes: the groups of the form
$\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_p$, where p is an odd prime. Our algorithm
works even in the most general case where the group is presented as a black-box
group with not necessarily unique encoding. Finally, we extend this result and
present an efficient algorithm solving the HSP over the groups
$\mathbb{Z}^m_{p^r}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_p$.
