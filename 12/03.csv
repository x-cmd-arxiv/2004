inhomogeneous disks, the reserve of disk strength against the growth of bending
instability is smaller than that for a homogeneous layer. The spheroidal
component (a dark halo, a bulge) is shown to have a stabilizing effect. The
latter turns out to depend not only on the total mass of the spherical
component, but also on the degree of mass concentration toward the center. We
conclude that the presence of a compact (not necessarily massive) bulge in
spiral galaxies may prove to be enough to suppress the bending perturbations
that increase the disk thickness. This conclusion is corroborated by our
$N$-body simulations in which we simulated the evolution of almost equilibrium,

The final disk thickness at the same total mass of the spherical component

measurements from recently published work on higher redshift clusters, up to
almost z=1. We focus our attention on galaxies in the cluster core, ie.
galaxies with r<0.7h^{-1}_{70}Mpc. Averaging over clusters in redshift bins, we
find that the fraction of galaxies with strong [OII] emission is < 20% in
cluster cores, and the fraction evolves little with redshift. In contrast,
field galaxies from the survey show a very strong increase over the same
redshift range. It thus appears that the environment in the cores of rich
clusters is hostile to star formation at all the redshifts studied. We compare
this result with the evolution of the colours of galaxies in cluster cores,
first reported by Butcher & Oemler (1984). Using the same galaxies for our
analysis of the [OII] emission, we confirm that the fraction of blue galaxies,
which are defined as galaxies 0.2 mag bluer in the rest frame B-V than the red
sequence of each cluster, increases strongly with redshift. Since the colours
of galaxies retain a memory of their recent star formation history, while
emission from the [OII] line does not, we suggest that these two results can
best be reconciled if the rate at which the clusters are being assembled is
higher in the past, and the galaxies from which it is being assembled are
typically bluer.

remain even with these stars. The many discrepancies in the relationships
between [X/Fe] as seen in Sculptor compared with Galactic field stars indicates
that our halo cannot be made up in bulk of stars similar to those presently

formation of the halo from such objects.

orbital period of the underlying binary, not a ""superhump"" as initially

flux distribution (F_nu ~ nu^1.3), and therefore a large bolometric correction.
Other evidence (the very strong He II 4686 emission, and a ROSAT detection in
soft X-rays) also indicates a strong EUV source, and comparison to
helium-atmosphere models suggests a temperature of 130+-10 kK. For a distance
of 350 pc, we estimate a luminosity of (0.8-1.7)x10^34 erg/s, yielding a mass
accretion rate of (2-4)x10^-9 M_sol/yr onto an assumed 0.7 M_sol white dwarf.
This appears to be about as expected for white dwarfs orbiting each other in a
10 minute binary, assuming that mass transfer is powered by gravitational
radiation losses. We estimate mean accretion rates for other helium-rich
cataclysmic variables, and find that they also follow the expected M-dot ~

apparent size of the luminous region) that the mass transfer stream in ES Cet
directly strikes the white dwarf, rather than circularizing to form an

from a dozen stars to many millions of stars. Embedded clusters containing more

There are observational indications that the expulsion of gas from such
clusters may occur within, or even quicker than, a stellar crossing-time scale.
Because the star-formation efficiency is empirically deduced to be typically
lower than 40 per cent, such clusters are left severely out of dynamical
equilibrium with a super-virial velocity dispersion when they are exposed. As a
consequence, they expand drastically.
  The velocity dispersion of expanding star-burst clusters may achieve values
of a few tens km/s, which would have a significant impact on the stellar
velocity distribution function and therefore the morphology of a galaxy. An
application of these ideas to the vertical structure of the Milky Way (MW) disk
suggests that such popping star clusters may constitute the missing heat source
for understanding the age-velocity-dispersion relation. If the early MW disk
experienced a vigorous epoch of star formation then perhaps even the thick disk
may have formed from popping clusters. Thus we have an alternative hypothesis
to understanding thick disks which does not rely on, or may act in addition to,
sinking galaxy satellites or sinking cosmological sub-structures. The GAIA
mission will test this hypothesis by allowing the kinematical fields around
young clusters to be mapped to exquisite precision.

structure and evolution of low-mass W UMa type contact binaries without angular
momentum loss (AML). The models exhibit cyclic behavior about a state of
marginal contact on a thermal time-scale. Part of the time of each cycle is
spent in contact and part in a semi-detached state. According to observations,
W UMa systems suffer AML. We present the models of low-mass contact binaries
with AML due to gravitational wave radiation (GR) or magnetic stellar wind
(MSW) are presented. We find that gravitational radiation cannot prevent the
cyclic evolution of W UMa systems, and the effect of gravitational radiation on
the cyclic behavior of contact binary evolution is almost negligible. We also
find that the most likely AML mechanism for W UMa systems is magnetic braking,
and that magnetic braking effects can increase the period of the cyclic
evolution, and shorten the fraction of the time spent in the poor thermal
contact state. If W UMa stars do not undergo cyclic evolution, and their
angular momentum loss is caused simultaneously by MSW of both components, we
find that the value of the parameter, $\lambda$, should be taken a larger value
in comparison with those derived from observations of single stars. This
indicates that the AML efficiency in W UMa systems may be lowered in comparison
with non-contact stars because of the less mass contained in the convective
envelopes of the components in W UMa systems. If W UMa systems lose their
angular momentum at a constant rate. An angular momentum rate of $\frac{{\rm

mainly from the infrared ones. The maximum energy of the relativistic electrons
can reach a Lorentz factor of $10^5$. We calculate the spectrum of the
synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering radiation from the electrons in the
torus. The relativistic electrons in the torus radiate non-thermal emission
from radio to $\gamma$-ray, which isotropically diffuses in the region of the
torus. We find the most prominent character is a peak at $\sim 0.5-1$ GeV. We
apply this model to NGC 1068 and find that the observed radio emission from the
core component $S_1$ can be explained by the synchrotron emission from the
relativistic electrons. We predict that there is a $\gamma$-ray emission with a
luminosity of $10^{40}$ erg/s peaking at $\sim 1$ GeV from the torus, which
could be detected by {\em Gamma-Ray Large-Array Space Telescope} in the future.
This will provide a new clue to understand the physics in the torus. The

second parameter. The dominance of the jet, parameterized as the ratio of the

suggest an observational scenario in which ABCG 209 is undergoing a strong
dynamical evolution with the merging of two or more subclumps along the SE-NW
direction in a plane which is not parallel to the plane of sky. The effect of
cluster environment on the global properties of the cluster galaxies is
examined through the analysis of the LFs, colour-magnitude relations, and

strong influence on galaxy evolution, so it is performed a detailed study of

support an evolutionary scenario in which ABCG 209 is characterized by a sum of
two components: an old galaxy population, formed very earlier (z >~ 3), and a

over a temperature range (300K to 870K) covering the orbital ordering
transition (710K). The Mn-O distances splitting into short and long bonds (1.95

octahedra remain locally Jahn-Teller distorted. Discontinuities in the Mn local
structure are identified in the extended x-ray fine structure spectra at this
temperature, associated to a reduction of the disorder in the super-exchange
angle and to the removal of the anisotropy in the radial disorder within the
coordination shell. Subtle changes in the electronic local structure also take
place at the Mn site at the transition temperature. The near edge spectra show
a small drop of the Mn 4p hole count and a small enhancement in the pre-edge

decomposing a metric space locally, at varying speeds, according to the density
of some probability measure. This provides a refined and unified framework for
the two primary methods of constructing Frechet embeddings for finite metrics,
due to [Bourgain, 1985] and [Rao, 1999]. We prove that any n-point metric space
(X,d) embeds in Hilbert space with distortion O(sqrt{alpha_X log n}), where
alpha_X is a geometric estimate on the decomposability of X. As an immediate
corollary, we obtain an O(sqrt{(log lambda_X) \log n}) distortion embedding,
where \lambda_X is the doubling constant of X. Since \lambda_X\le n, this
result recovers Bourgain's theorem, but when the metric X is, in a sense,
``low-dimensional,'' improved bounds are achieved.
  Our embeddings are volume-respecting for subsets of arbitrary size. One
consequence is the existence of (k, O(log n)) volume-respecting embeddings for
all 1 \leq k \leq n, which is the best possible, and answers positively a
question posed by U. Feige. Our techniques are also used to answer positively a
question of Y. Rabinovich, showing that any weighted n-point planar graph
embeds in l_\infty^{O(log n)} with O(1) distortion. The O(log n) bound on the
dimension is optimal, and improves upon the previously known bound of O((log

primal-dual potential reduction method for solving a class of semidefinite
programs. When the problem data is sparse, the dual variable is also sparse,
but the primal one is not. To avoid working with the dense primal variable, we
apply Fukuda et al.'s theory of partial matrix completion and work with partial
matrices instead. The other place in the algorithm where sparsity should be
exploited is in the computation of the search direction, where the gradient and
the Hessian-matrix product of the primal and dual barrier functions must be
computed in every iteration. By using an idea from automatic differentiation in
backward mode, both the gradient and the Hessian-matrix product can be computed
in time proportional to the time needed to compute the barrier functions of
sparse variables itself. Moreover, the high space complexity that is normally
associated with the use of automatic differentiation in backward mode can be
avoided in this case. In addition, we suggest a technique to efficiently
compute the determinant of the positive definite matrix completion that is
required to compute primal search directions. The method of obtaining one of
the primal search directions that minimizes the number of the evaluations of
the determinant of the positive definite completion is also proposed. We then
implement the algorithm and test it on the problem of finding the maximum cut
of a graph.

beta decay (\beta\beta 0 \nu). The expected performance of the detector has
been successfully achieved. Half-lives of the two neutrinos double beta decay
(\beta\beta 2 \nu$) have been measured for ^{100} Mo, ^{82}Se, ^{96}Zr,
^{116}Cd and ^{150}Nd. After 265 days of data collection from February 2003
until March 2004, no evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay (\beta\beta 0
\nu) was found from \sim 7 kg of ^{100} Mo and \sim 1 kg of ^{82} Se. The
corresponding lower limits for the half-lives are 3.5 \times 10^{23} years at
90% C.L for ^{100} Mo and 1.9 \times 10^{23} years for ^{82}Se. Limits for the
effective Majorana neutrino mass are < \hspace{-0.5mm} m_{\nu} \hspace{-0.5mm}

today and a Radon-free purification system will be in operation by the end of
september 2004. The NEMO-3 expected sensitivity after 5 years of data is 0.2
eV.

These searches are based on data collected by the CDF and the \D0 experiments
operating at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider with $\sqrt{s}$ =
1.96 TeV. The review focuses on searches for squarks and gluinos in final
states with missing transverse energy and jets. Emphasis will be given to the
search for the gluino decaying into a sbottom and $b$ quark with each sbottom
decaying into a $b$ quark and a neutralino. This scenario yields events

inspired by recent formulations of anisotropic QED$_3$ as an effective theory
of the non-superconducting portion of the cuprate phase diagram, with
relativistic fermion degrees of freedom defined near the nodes of the gap
function on the Fermi surface, and massless photon degrees of freedom
reproducing the dynamics of the phase disorder of the superconducting order

isotropic limit, our results show that the renormalised anisotropy, defined in
terms of the ratio of correlation lengths of gauge invariant bound states in
the $x$ and $y$ directions, exceeds the explicit anisotropy $\kappa$ introduced
in the lattice action, implying in contrast to recent analytic results that
anisotropy is a relevant deformation of QED$_3$. There also appears to be a
chiral symmetry restoring phase transition at $\kappa_c\simeq4.5$, implying
that the pseudogap phase persists down to T=0 in the cuprate phase diagram.

dispersive treatments. Finally, we briefly discuss magnetic moments and show

mixing angle is approximately the Cabibbo angle, i.e. QLC relation. We argue
that it is not plausible that this deviation from maximality, be it a
coincidence or not, comes from the charged lepton mixing. Consequently we have
calculated the required corrections to the exactly bimaximal neutrino mass
matrix ansatz necessary to account for the solar mass difference and the solar
mixing angle. We point out that the relative size of these two corrections
depends strongly on the hierarchy case under consideration. We find that the
inverted hierarchy case with opposite CP parities, which is known to guarantee
the RGE stability of the solar mixing angle, offers the most plausible scenario
for a high energy origin of a QLC-corrected bimaximal neutrino mass matrix.
This possibility may allow us to explain the QLC relation in connection with
the origin of the charged fermion mass matrices.

the generalization of the Burnett-Kroll theorem for polarized vector-meson
states is held only if $g=2$. In addition, radiative interferences between the
electric charge and any gauge invariant term is found to be parametrized by a
common global factor which can be used to extract information of the involved
states by a proper choice of the kinematical region, where they could be
relevant.

and its approximation by bulk semi-classical methods begun by earlier authors.
At the end, the Lorentzian treatment is self-contained and requires no analytic
continuation from the Euclidean. The new features involve a careful study of
boundary terms associated with an initial time $t_-$ and a final time $t_+$.
These boundary terms are determined by a choice of quantum states. The main
results in the semi-classical approximation are 1) The times $t_\pm$ may be
finite, and need only label Cauchy surfaces respectively to the past and future
of the points at which one wishes to obtain CFT correlators. Subject to this
condition on $t_\pm$, we provide a bulk computation of CFT correlators that is
manifestly independent of $t_\pm$. 2) As a result of (1), all CFT correlators
can be expressed in terms of a path integral over regions of spacetime {\it
outside} of any black hole horizons. 3) The details of the boundary terms at
$t_\pm$ serve to guarrantee that, at leading order in this approximation, any
CFT one-point function is given by a simple boundary value of the classical
bulk solution at null infinity, $I$. This work is dedicated to the memory of
Bryce S. DeWitt. The remarks in this paper largely study the relation of the
AdS/CFT dictionary to the Schwinger variational principle, which the author
first learned from DeWitt as a Ph.D. student.

space and a motion on the boundary of the domain. Then, we show that the

transition, probed after it is excited by an intense, linearly polarized,
collinear laser, tuned to resonance for one hyperfine line of the forbidden
6S-7S transition in a longitudinal electric field. We report here a 3.5 fold
increase, of the one-second-measurement sensitivity, and subsequent reduction
by a factor of 3.5 of the statistical accuracy compared with our previous
result [J. Gu\'ena et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 143001 (2003)]. Decisive
improvements to the set-up include an increased repetition rate, better
extinction of the probe beam at the end of the probe pulse and, for the first
time to our knowledge, the following: a polarization-tilt magnifier,
quasi-suppression of beam reflections at the cell windows, and a Cs cell with
electrically conductive windows. We also present real-time tests of systematic
effects, consistency checks on the data, as well as a 1% accurate measurement
of the electric field seen by the atoms, from atomic signals. PV measurements
performed in seven different vapor cells agree within the statistical error.
Our present result is compatible with the more precise Boulder result within
our present relative statistical accuracy of 2.6%, corresponding to a 2 \times
10^{-13} atomic-unit uncertainty in E_1^{pv}. Theoretical motivations for
further measurements are emphasized and we give a brief overview of a recent

creating conditions where asymmetry amplification is much greater.

problem of classical electrodynamics. We introduce the concept of resonant
dissipation, i.e. a motion that radiates the center-of-mass energy while the
interparticle distance performs bounded oscillations about a metastable orbit.
The stability mechanism is established by the existence of a quartic resonant
constant generated by the stiff eigenvalues of the linear stability problem.
This constant bounds the particles together during the radiative recoil. The
condition of resonant dissipation predicts angular momenta for the metastable
orbits in reasonable agreement with the Bohr atom. The principal result is that
the emission lines agree with the predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED)
with 1 percent average error even up to the $40^{th}$ line. Our angular momenta
depend logarithmically on the mass of the heavy body, such that the deuterium
and the muonium atoms have essentially the same angular momenta, in agreement
with QED. Analogously to QED, our stability analysis naturally uses the
eigenvalues of an infinite-dimensional linear operator; the
infinite-dimensionality is brought in by the delay of the electromagnetic
interaction.

thermodynamic constraints on the stability of the native state influence
protein evolution in a site-specific manner. To this end, we represent both
protein sequences and protein structures as vectors: Structures are represented
by the principal eigenvector (PE) of the protein contact matrix, a quantity
that resembles closely the effective connectivity of each site; Sequences are
represented through the ``interactivity'' of each amino acid type, using novel
parameters that are correlated with hydropathy scales. These interactivity
parameters are more strongly correlated than the other hydropathy scales that
we examine with: (1) The change upon mutations of the unfolding free energy of
proteins with two-states thermodynamics; (2) Genomic properties as the
genome-size and the genome-wide GC content; (3) The main eigenvectors of the
substitution matrices. The evolutionary average of the interactivity vector
correlates very strongly with the PE of a protein structure. Using this result,
we derive an analytic expression for site-specific distributions of amino acids
across protein families in the form of Boltzmann distributions whose ``inverse
temperature'' is a function of the PE component. We show that our predictions
are in agreement with site-specific amino acid distributions obtained from the
Protein Data Bank, and we determine the mutational model that best fits the
observed site-specific amino acid distributions. Interestingly, the optimal
model almost minimizes the rate at which deleterious mutations are eliminated
by natural selection.

network models with canalyzing rules for a variety of architectures. For all
power law, exponential, and flat in-degree distributions, we find that the
networks are dynamically stable. Furthermore, for architectures with few inputs
per node, the dynamics of the networks is close to critical. In addition, the
fraction of genes that are active decreases with the number of inputs per node.
These results are based upon investigating ensembles of networks using
analytical methods. Also, for different in-degree distributions, the numbers of
fixed points and cycles are calculated, with results intuitively consistent
with stability analysis; fewer inputs per node implies more cycles, and vice
versa. There are hints that genetic networks acquire broader degree
distributions with evolution, and hence our results indicate that for single
cells, the dynamics should become more stable with evolution. However, such an
effect is very likely compensated for by multicellular dynamics, because one
expects less stability when interactions among cells are included. We verify
this by simulations of a simple model for interactions among cells.
