and conclusions of Paper I, and is thus consistent with the steady nature of
the 1D streamline line-driven disk wind models of Murray and collaborators and
the 2.5D line-driven disk wind models of Pereyra and collaborators. When
including gas pressures effects, as is routinely done in time-dependent
numerical models, I find that the spatial dependence of the nozzle function
continues to play a key role in determining the steady/unsteady nature of
supersonic line-driven wind solutions. I show here that the
existence/nonexistence of local wind solutions can be proved through the nozzle
function without integrating the equation of motion. This work sets a detailed
framework with which we will analyze, in a following paper, more realistic
models than the ""simple"" models of Paper I.

a direct continuation of the LSP sequence toward fainter stars, what might
suggest that the LSP phenomenon is related to binarity but there are strong

have been performed on globular clusters or elliptical galaxies, which are
mostly dust-free systems. However, many recent studies of integrated stellar
populations have focused on spiral galaxies which may contain significant
amounts of dust. It is almost universally assumed that the effects of dust
extinction on absorption-line measurements are entirely negligible given the
narrow baseline of the spectral features, but no rigorous study has yet been
performed to verify this conjecture. In this analysis, we explore the
sensitivity of the standard set of Lick absorption-line indices, the
higher-order Balmer line indices, the 4000 A break, the near-IR calcium triplet
indices, and the Rose indices to dust absorption according to population
synthesis models that incorporate a multi-component model for the line and
continuum attenuation due to dust. The latter takes into account the finite
lifetime of stellar birth clouds. While dust does not greatly affect the
line-index measurements for single stellar populations, its effect can be
significant for the 4000 A break or when there is a significant amount of
current star formation.

extended analysis incorporates the observed submillimetre (850 micron) flux
densities of radio sources, employs a new method which allows us to deal with
non detections, and focuses on the high-luminosity population. First, we
conclude that the submillimetre luminosity L_{850} of low-frequency-selected
radio sources is correlated with the bolometric luminosity L_{Bol} of their
quasar nuclei via an approximate scaling relation L_{850} \propto L_{Bol}^{0.7

fact that radio quasars are brighter in both narrow emission lines and
submillimetre luminosity than radio galaxies matched in radio luminosity and
redshift. Third, we note that the combination of a receding-torus-like scheme
and the assumption that the observed submillimetre emission is dominated by
quasar-heated dust yields a scaling relation L_{850} \propto L_{Bol}^{0.5}

theoretical assumptions by utilising the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS).
We derive empirically the halo occupation and galaxy radial distributions in
the haloes of the 2dF Percolation-Inferred Galaxy Group (2PIGG) catalogue. The
mean halo occupation number is found to be well-fitted by a power-law, <N|M> ~
M^b, at high masses, with b = 1.05, 0.88, 0.99 for red, blue and all galaxies

spectrum to these results, we compare these empirical predictions of the halo
model with the observed correlation functions for these same 2dF galaxy
populations. We conclude that subject to some fine tuning it is an acceptable
model for the two-point correlations. Our analysis also explains why the
correlation function slope of the red galaxies is steeper than that of the blue
galaxies. It is mainly due to the number of red and blue galaxies per halo,
rather than the radial distribution within the haloes of the two galaxy
species.

comprehensive parameter study varying galaxy properties (mass, vertical
structure of the gas disk) and covering a large range of ICM conditions,
reaching from high density environments like in cluster centres to low density
environments typical for cluster outskirts or groups. We find that the ICM-ISM
interaction proceeds in three phases: firstly the instantaneous stripping
phase, secondly the dynamic intermediate phase, thirdly the quasi-stable
continuous viscous stripping phase. The stripping efficiency depends slightly
on the Mach number of the flow, however, the main parameter is the ram
pressure. The stripping efficiency does not depend on the vertical structure
and thickness of the gas disk. We discuss uncertainties in the classic estimate
of the stripping radius of \citet{gunn72}, and adapt the estimate used by

pressure). We find that the latter estimate predicts the radius and mass of the
gas disk remaining at the end of the second phase very well, and better than
the \citet{gunn72} criterion. From our simulations we conclude that gas disks
of galaxies in high density environments are heavily truncated or even

SX Phoenicis stars discovered in the field of the cluster. For most of the
stars we have reliable absolute magnitudes and colors. Except of one, or

behaviour is very diversified. Multiperiodic variability with at least part of
the excited modes being nonradial is most common but there are also many cases
of high amplitude, presumably radial mode, pulsators. In a number of such cases
we have evidence for two radial modes being excited. Parameters of radial mode
pulsators are in most cases consistent with standard evolutionary models for
stars in the mass range 0.9-1.15 Mo. However, in four cases we have evidence
that the masses are significantly lower than expected. Three objects show
frequency triplets that may be interpreted in terms of rotational frequency
splitting of l=1 modes. Implied equatorial velocities of rotation are from 10
to over 100 km/s. Nearly all measured frequencies fall in the ranges predicted
for unstable modes. Two cases of low frequency variability are interpreted as
being caused by tidal distortion induced by close companions.

brane inflation. We show how they can be distinguished from the conventional
ones. The cosmic strings in angled inflation are the daughter $D_{p-2}$ branes
that are extended between the mother $D_p$ branes. In the effective action, the
strings should have a moduli, since the endpoints of the $D_{p-2}$ branes can
move freely on the $D_p$ branes. Then naturally the position of the $D_{p-2}$
branes, which corresponds to the moduli of the $(1+1)$-dimensional effective
action, can vary along the cosmic strings. The variation of the moduli results
in the peculiar $(1+1)$-dimensional kink configurations. The kinks are the
monopoles on the strings. Therefore, the cosmic strings in angled inflation
become necklaces. The loops of the necklaces can shrink to produce stable
winding states, which look like coils. We show why the cosmological
implications of the brane necklaces are important. We point out that the cosmic
strings in generic models of brane inflation should become necklaces, depending
on the structure of the compactified space and the effective potential of the
model.

algebra coincides with the algebra of invariants of a single unipotent

algebras of constants of triangular linear derivations of finitely generated

the algebras are free in some sense (in most of the cases relatively free
algebras in varieties of associative or Lie algebras). In this case the algebra
of constants also coincides with the algebra of invariants of some unipotent

subalgebra of constants of a factor algebra can be lifted to the subalgebra of
constants. 2. For all varieties of associative algebras which are not nilpotent
in Lie sense the subalgebras of constants of the relatively free algebras of
rank $\geq 2$ are not finitely generated. 3. We describe the generators of the
subalgebra of constants for all factor algebras $K< x,y>/I$ modulo a
$GL_2(K)$-invariant ideal $I$. 4. Applying known results from commutative

that the frequency of the sound is the frequency of the relative motion of the

motions. The existence of a velocity threshold in both experiments further
shows that this synchronization comes from an acoustic resonance within the

  Krasnoholovets (Nova Science Publishers Inc., New York, 2004), pp. 85-109",,,"physics.gen-ph physics.atom-ph",,"  It is the matter of fact that quantum mechanics operates with notions that
are not determined in the frame of the mechanics' formalism. Among them we can
call the notion of ""wave-particle"" (that, however, does not appear in both
classical and high energy physics), the probabilistic interpretation of the
Schroedinger wave \psi-function and hence the probability amplitude and its
phase, long-range action, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the passage to
the so-called operators of physical values, etc. Orthodox quantum mechanics was
constructed as a physical theory developed in the phase space of the mentioned
notions. That is why the formalism of quantum mechanics is aimed only at
detailed calculations of the stationary states of the energy of the quantum
system studied and is not able to describe a real path running by the system in
the real space; instead, the formalism gives an averaged probabilistic
prediction. Thus, if we are able to develop quantum mechanics in the real
space, an option to clarify all the difficulties associated with the above
notions would appear. Such a theory of quantum mechanics developed in the real
space in fact has recently been constructed by the author. The theory started
from deeper first principles, namely, from the consideration of the notion of a
4D space-time. So, the notion of fundamental particle, the principles of the
motion of a particle and other characteristics have been made clear. The
theory, rather a submicroscopic one, is characterized by short-range action
that automatically means the introduction of a new kind of carriers, i.e.
carriers of the quantum mechanical force. The existence of the carriers called
""inertons"" (because they carry inert properties of matter) has indeed been
verified in a number of experiments.
