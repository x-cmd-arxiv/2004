lines in the spectra of thermonuclear bursts from EXO 0748-676, we have
investigated the information about neutron star structure and the geometry of
the emission region that can be obtained by analyzing the profiles of atomic
lines formed at the surface of the star. We have calculated the detailed
profiles of such lines, taking into account the star's spin and the full
effects of special and general relativity, including light-bending and
frame-dragging. We discuss the line shapes produced by rotational Doppler
broadening and magnetic splitting of atomic lines, for the spin rates and
magnetic fields expected in neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems. We
show that narrow lines are possible even for rapidly spinning stars, if the
emission region or the line of sight are close to the spin axis. For most
neutron stars in low-mass systems, magnetic splitting is too small to obscure
the effects of special and general relativity. We show that the ratio of the
star's mass to its equatorial radius can be determined to within 5% using
atomic line profiles, even if the lines are broad and skewed. This is the
precision required to constrain strongly the equation of state of neutron star
matter. We show further that if the radius and latitude of emission are known
to ~ 5-10% accuracy, then frame-dragging has a potentially detectable effect on
the profiles of atomic lines formed at the stellar surface.

Dust has a profound effect on the appearance of the simulated galaxies. At peak
luminosities, about 90% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed, and the dust
obscuration scales with luminosity in such a way that the brightness at
UV/visual wavelengths remains roughly constant. A general relationship between
the fraction of energy absorbed and the ratio of bolometric luminosity to
baryonic mass is found. Comparing to observations, the simulations are found to
follow a relation similar to the observed IRX-Beta relation found by Meurer et
al (1999) when similar luminosity objects are considered. The
highest-luminosity simulated galaxies depart from this relation and occupy the
region where local (U)LIRGs are found. This agreement is contingent on the
presence of Milky-Way-like dust, while SMC-like dust results in far too red a
UV continuum slope to match observations. The simulations are used to study the
performance of star-formation indicators in the presence of dust. The
far-infrared luminosity is found to be reliable. In contrast, the H-alpha and
far-UV luminosity suffer severely from dust attenuation, and dust corrections
can only partially remedy the situation.

on the thermal state of the clumpy intergalactic medium (IGM). The model
assumes that patchy reionization develops as a result of the discrete
distribution of QSOs. It includes various recipes for the propagation of the
ionizing photons, and treats photo-heating self-consistently. The model
provides the fraction of He III, the mean temperature in the IGM, and the He II
mean optical depth -- all as a function of redshift. It also predicts the
evolution of the local temperature versus density relation during reionization.
Our findings are as follows: The fraction of He III increases gradually until
it becomes close to unity at $z\sim 2.8-3.0$. The He II mean optical depth
decreases from $\tau\sim 10$ at $z\geq 3.5$ to $\tau\leq 0.5$ at $z\leq 2.5$.
The mean temperature rises gradually between $z\sim 4$ and $z\sim 3$ and
declines slowly at lower redshifts. The model predicts a flattening of the
temperature-density relation with significant increase in the scatter during
reionization at $z\sim 3$. Towards the end of reionization the scatter is
reduced and a tight relation is re-established. This scatter should be
incorporated in the analysis of the Ly$\alpha$ forest at $z\leq 3$. Comparison
with observational results of the optical depth and the mean temperature at
moderate redshifts constrains several key physical parameters.

an integral over all separate star-formation events. Since most stars form in
star clusters with different masses the integrated IMF becomes an integral of
the (universal or invariant) canonical stellar IMF over the star-cluster mass
function. This integrated IMF is steeper (contains fewer massive stars per
G-type star) than the canonical stellar IMF. Furthermore, observations indicate
a relation between the star-formation rate of a galaxy and the most luminous
stellar cluster in it. This empirical relation can be transformed into one
between the star-formation rate of a galaxy and a maximum cluster mass. The
assumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of a young-cluster mass
function leads to a connection of the star-formation rate and the slope of
integrated IMF for massive stars. This integrated IMF varies with the
star-formation history of a galaxy. Notably, large variations of the integrated
IMF are evident for dwarf galaxies. One important result is that the number of
type II supernovae per star is supressed relative to that expected for a
canonical IMF, and that dwarf galaxies have a supressed number of supernovae
per star relative to massive galaxies. For dwarf galaxies the number of
supernovae per star also varies substantially depending on the galaxy assembly

calculate how it affects their observational appearance. Our model involves the
detailed solution of the coagulation equation at every location in the disk. At
regular time intervals we feed the resulting 3-D dust distribution functions
into a continuum radiative transfer code to obtain spectral energy
distributions. We find that, even if only the very basic -- and well understood
-- coagulation mechanisms are included, the process of grain growth is much too
quick to be consistent with infrared observations of T Tauri disks. Small
grains are removed so efficiently that, long before the disk reaches an age of
1E6 years typical of T Tauri stars, the SED shows only very weak infrared
excess. This is inconsistent with observed SEDs of most classical T Tauri
stars. Small grains somehow need to be replenished, for instance by aggregate
fragmentation through high-speed collisions. A very simplified calculation
shows that when aggregate fragmentation is included, a quasi-stationary grain
size distribution is obtained in which growth and fragmentation are in
equilibrium. This quasi-stationary state may last 1E6 years or even longer,
dependent on the circumstances in the disk, and may bring the time scales into
the right regime. We conclude that a simple evolutionary scenario in which
grains slowly grow from pristine 0.1 micron grains to larger grains over a
period of a few Myr is most likely incorrect.

departing from ionisation equilibrium, violating the basic assumptions

find also that line intensities tend to be lower where velocities of the order
of 30 km/s or higher are measured in transition region lines. The DEM analysis
is also exploited to improve the line identification performed by Brooks et al

blurring due to optical beam smearing and seeing). Using these fits, the

This confirms our previous analysis which was limited to ground-based imaging.
The observed overluminosity of low-mass galaxies is at variance with
predictions from simulations. On the other hand, at given Vmax, we find
slightly smaller disk sizes towards higher redshifts, in compliance with the

limit required for spectroscopy. Wide-field surveys of nearby groups using
mosaic CCDs on large telescopes are able to reach much fainter absolute
magnitudes, about M_R = -10. These diffuse, spiral-rich groups are thought to
be typical environments for galaxies so their luminosity functions should be
the same as the field luminosity function. The luminosity function of the
groups at the bright end (M_R < -17) is limited by Poisson statistics and is
far less precise than that derived from redshift surveys. Here we combine the
results of the SDSS and the surveys of nearby groups and supplement the results

logarithmic slope of the field luminosity function between M_R = -19 and M_R =

the entire magnitude range. We also determine the luminosity function of galaxy
clusters and demonstrate that it is different from the field luminosity
function at a high level of significance: there are many more dwarf galaxies in

densest area of the molecular cloud near IRAS16362-4845, we also find a group

some other stars beyond the edge of the molecular cloud. The intense ionizing
radiation field by the O stars in NGC6193 is a clear candidate trigger of star
formation in the molecular cloud, and we suggest that the existence and

their formation may be a consequence of this. However, IR excess stars are also
present in some areas of the opposite side of the cloud, where no obvious
candidate external trigger is identified. The existence of such tracers of
recent star formation scattered across the more massive molecular cloud

to the less massive cloud close to NGC 6193, which seems to be more evolved and
mostly already recycled into stars, and whose internal kinematics show hints of

The survey completeness is limited by the small epoch differences between many
2MASS and UKI observations. Hence we only recover 22% of Luyten objects with
favourable photometry. However the Luyten study is itself unquantifiably
incomplete. We discuss the prospect of enhancing the survey volume by reducing
the lower proper motion limit.

harmonics in the current spectra are detected, which provide information about
higher--order conductivity coefficients. Our method ensures that these
higher--order conductivity coefficients are exclusively governed by
field--dependent ion transport and are not influenced by Joule heating effects.
We use the low-field dc conductivity $\sigma_{1,dc}$ and the higher--order dc
conductivity coefficient $\sigma_{3,dc}$ to calculate apparent jump distances
for the mobile ions, $a_{\rm app}$. Over a temperature range from 283 K to 353

considerably larger than typical values published in the literature for various
ion conducting glasses. These values were obtained by applying dc electric
fields. Our results provide clear evidence that the equation used in the
literature to calculate the apparent jump distances does not provide an

novel approach which entails an initial coarse-grained Monte Carlo (MC) scheme
followed by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent.
The MC evolution occurs in a simplified free-energy landscape and allows an
efficient selection of marginally-compact structures which are taken as viable
initial conformations for the MD. The coarse-grained MC structural
representation is connected to the one with atomic resolution through a
``fine--graining'' reconstruction algorithm. This two-stage strategy is used to
select and follow the dynamics of seven different unrelated conformations of

state, yielding a typical RMS deviation of the core region of only 2.4 A from
the closest NMR model (the typical RMSD over the whole structure being 4.0A).
The analysis of the various MC-MD trajectories provides valuable insight into
the details of the folding and mis-folding mechanisms and particularly about
the delicate influence of local and non-local interactions in steering the
folding process.

zero-range process with open boundaries for arbitrary bulk and boundary hopping
rates. When such a distribution exists, the steady state has no correlations
between sites and is uniquely characterized by a space-dependent fugacity which
is a function of the boundary rates and the hopping asymmetry. For strong
boundary drive the system has no stationary distribution. In systems which on a
ring geometry allow for a condensation transition, a condensate develops at one
or both boundary sites. On all other sites the particle distribution approaches
a product measure with the finite critical density \rho_c. In systems which do
not support condensation on a ring, strong boundary drive leads to a condensate
at the boundary. However, in this case the local particle density in the
interior exhibits a complex algebraic growth in time. We calculate the bulk and
boundary growth exponents as a function of the system parameters.

the driven fluid mediates an effective long-range attraction between the two

function of the interaction parameters. Depending on the amplitude b the two
probes may form one of three states: (a) an unbound state, where the distance
grows diffusively with time; (b) a weakly bound state, in which the distance
grows sub-diffusively; and (c) a strongly bound state, where the average

study of the question of the ''anomalous'' (non-Fickian) diffusion that it is
involved in experiments of cyclic voltammetry in electro-physical chemistry. In
them one is dealing with the fractal-like structure of the thin film morphology
present in eletrodes in microbatteries which leads to fractional-power laws for
describing voltammetry measurements and in the determination of the interphase
width derived using atomic force microscopy. The fractional-powers associated
to these quantities are related to each other and to the statistical fractal
dimension, and can be expressed in terms of a power index, on which depends
Renyi's statistical mechanics. It is clarified the important fact that this
index, which is limited to a given interval, provides a measure of the
microroughness of the electrode surface, and is related to the dynamics
involved, the non-equilibrium thermodynamic state of the system, and to the
experimental protocol. \\

employ a normalization factor in the definition of the decay operator in the

that neutrinos have non-zero mass, but without pinning down their absolute
masses. While it is established that the effect of light neutrinos on the
evolution of cosmic structure is small, the upper limits derived from
large-scale structure could help significantly to constrain the absolute scale
of the neutrino masses. It is also important to know the sum of neutrino masses
as it is degenerate with the values of other cosmological parameters, e.g. the
amplitude of fluctuations and the primordial spectral index. A summary of
cosmological neutrino mass limits is given. Current results from cosmology set
an upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of ~1 eV, somewhat depending

the k-chameleon field and background matters can be neglected, the behavior of
the k-chameleon therefore is the same as that of the ordinary k-essence. After
the onset of matter domination, the strong coupling between the k-chameleon and
matters dramatically changes the result of the ordinary k-essence. We find that
during the matter-dominated epoch, only two kinds of attractors may exist: one
is the familiar {\bf K} attractor and the other is a completely {\em new},
dubbed {\bf C} attractor. Once the universe is attracted into the {\bf C}
attractor, the fraction energy densities of the k-chameleon $\Omega_{\phi}$ and

a power-law accelerated expansion. One can adjust the model so that the {\bf K}

basis for the topology of the spacetime ordered under inclusion. The category
of sectors, is equivalent to the category of 1-cocycles of the poset with
values in the net. We succeed to analyze the structure of this category because
we show how topological properties of the spacetime are encoded in the poset
used as index set: the first homotopy group of a poset is introduced and it is
shown that the fundamental group of the poset and the one of the underlying
spacetime are isomorphic; any 1-cocycle defines a unitary representation of
these fundamental groups. Another important result is the invariance of the

$E$, any other RCLL stochastic process $X$ adapted to the filtration induced by

understood as an extension of a stochastic process to a standard Borel space
enjoying nice properties. Moreover, the trajectories of the factorized
stochastic process defined on $D_E[0,\infty)$ inherit the properties of being
continuous, non-decreasing, and of bounded variation, resp., from those of $X$.
  Considering situations which are invariant under the factorization procedure,
the main theorem is a reduction tool to assume the underlying measurable space
be a standard Borel space. In an example, we pick the existence theorem of
regular conditional probabilities on standard Borel spaces to simplify a

equation is investigated. Although the Dirac equation is written usually in the
relativistically covariant form, the dynamic system S_D is not completely
relativistic, because its description contains such absolute objects as $\gamma
$-matrices $\gamma ^{k}$, forming a matrix vector. By means of the proper
change of variables the $\gamma $-matrices are eliminated, but instead of them
the constant timlike vector $f^{k}$ appears. The vector $f^{k}$ describes an
absolute splitting of the space-time into space and time, which is
characteristic for the nonrelativistic description. To investigate a degree of
the violation of the S_D relativistic description, we consider the classical
Dirac particle S_{Dcl}, obtained from S_D by means of the relativistic dynamic
disquantization. The classical dynamic system S_{Dcl} appears to be composite,
because it has ten degrees of freedom. Six translational degrees of freedom are
described relativistically (without a reference to $f^{k}$), whereas four
internal degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically, because their
description refers to $f^{k}$. Coupling the absolute vector $f^{k}$ with the
energy-momentum vector of S_{Dcl}, the classical Dirac particle S_{Dcl} is
modified minimally. The vector $f^{k}$ ceases to be absolute, and the modified
classical Dirac particle S_{mDcl} becomes to be completely relativistic. The
dynamic equations for S_{mDcl} are solved. Solutions for S_{Dcl} and S_{mDcl}

electrons. This model allows the computation of the thermodynamic properties of
dense helium over an extended range of density and temperature and leads to the
computation of the phase diagram of dense fluid helium, with its various
temperature and pressure ionization contours. One of the predictions of the
model is that pressure ionization occurs abruptly at $\rho \simgr 10$ g
cm$^{-3}$, {\it i.e.} $P\simgr 20$ Mbar, from atomic helium He to fully ionized
helium He$^{2+}$, or at least to a strongly ionized state, without He$^{+}$

dominant. These predictions and this phase diagram provide a guide for future
dynamical experiments or numerical first-principle calculations aimed at
studying the properties of helium at very high density, in particular its
metallization. Indeed, the characterization of the helium phase diagram bears
important consequences for the thermodynamic, magnetic and transport properties

of primers and the off-lattice character of the primer distribution on the
surface. The sigmoidal character of the primer occupation by DNA, observed
experimentally, is reproduced in the simulation. We discuss an influence of two
parameters on the efficience of the amplification process: the initial density
p_0 of the occupied primers from the interfacial amplification and the ratio r
of the molecule length to the average distance between primers. The number of
cycles till the saturation decreases with p_0 roughly as p_0^{-0.26}. For
r=1.5, the number of occupied primers is reduced by a factor two, when compared
to the case of longer molecules. Below r=1.4, the effectivity of SPA is reduced
by a factor 100.

quantitative terms. In particular, the expression of genes is regularly
characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Whether
discussing the level of gene expression in a bacterium or its precise location
within a developing embryo, the natural language for these experiments is that
of numbers. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. We review a
class of models (""thermodynamic models"") which exploit statistical mechanics to
compute the probability that RNA polymerase is at the appropriate promoter.
This provides a mathematically precise elaboration of the idea that activators
are agents of recruitment which increase the probability that RNA polymerase
will be found at the promoter of interest. We discuss a framework which
describes the interactions of repressors, activators, helper molecules and RNA
polymerase using the concept of effective concentrations, expressed in terms of
a function we call the ""regulation factor"". This analysis culminates in an
expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of
interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell. In a
companion paper [1], these ideas are applied to several case studies which
illustrate the use of the general formalism.

of transcription factors, and apply the thermodynamic framework to these

description useful for higher-level studies, e.g., of genetic networks, without
the need to invoke the biochemical details of every component. Moreover, it can

minimum $\xi$ are not optimal for single-shot measurements of an arbitrary

figure-of-merit for this case. We show that (unlike the states that minimize
$\xi$), the states that minimize $\zeta$ can be created by evolving an
unentangled state (coherent spin state) by the well-known 2-axis
counter-twisting Hamiltonian. We analyse these and other states (for example
the maximally entangled state, analogous to the optical ""NOON"" state $|\psi> =

$\zeta$, the coefficients in the pseudo angular momentum basis (in the three
