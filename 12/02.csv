luminosity evolution of early-type gravitational lens galaxies. The method is
based on the fundamental plane, which we interpret using the aperture
mass-radius relations derived from lensed image geometries. We apply this
method to our previous sample of 22 lens galaxies with measured redshifts and
excellent photometry. Modeling the population with a single mass profile and
evolutionary history, we find that early-type galaxies are nearly isothermal
(logarithmic density slope n = 2.06 +/- 0.17, 68% C.L.), and that their stars
evolve at a rate of dlog(M/L)_B/dz = -0.50 +/- 0.19 (68% C.L.) in the rest
frame B band. For a Salpeter IMF and a concordance cosmology, this implies a
mean star formation redshift of <z_f> > 1.5 at 95% confidence. While this model
can neatly describe the mean properties of early-type galaxies, it is clear
that the scatter of the lens sample is too large to be explained by
observational uncertainties alone. We therefore consider statistical models in
which the galaxy population is described by a distribution of star formation
redshifts. We find that stars must form over a significant range of redshifts
(Delta z_f > 1.7, 68% C.L.), which can extend as low as z_f = 1 for some
acceptable models. However, the typical galaxy will still have an old stellar
population (<z_f> > 1.5). The lens sample therefore favors early star formation
in field ellipticals -- even if we make no a priori assumption regarding the
shape of the mass distribution in lenses, and include the range of possible
deviations from homology in the uncertainties. Our evolution results call into
question several recent claims that early-type galaxies in low-density
environments have much younger stars than those in rich clusters.

the equipartition magnetic field strengths. The relative ease with which the
lobe X-ray emission is detected is a consequence of the (1+z)^4 increase in the
energy density of the CMB. An HST image of one of the sources shows that the
X-ray emission could also be produced by a reservoir of hot, shocked gas, as
evidenced by a bright, optical bow-shock.
  By stacking our data we created a deep, 100 ksec exposure to search for
diffuse X-ray emission from intra-cluster gas. We detect no diffuse emission

We recover the atmospheric signal in the presence of instrument noise by
calculating the correlation between signals from distinct elements of the ACBAR
bolometer array. With this method, it is possible to measure atmospheric
brightness fluctuations with high SNR even under the most stable atmospheric
conditions. The observed atmospheric signal is characterized by the parameters
of the Komolgorov-Taylor (KT) model, which are the amplitude and power law
exponent describing the atmospheric power spectrum, and the two components of
the wind angular velocity at the time of the observation. The KT model is
typically a good description of the observed fluctuations, and fits to the data
produce values of the Komolgorov exponent that are consistent with theoretical
expectations. By combining the wind angular velocity results with measurements
of the wind linear velocity, we find that the altitude of the observed
atmospheric fluctuations is consistent with the distribution of water vapor
determined from radiosonde data. For data corresponding to frequency passbands

equal to the period of the orbit. If a second planet is introduced the orbit is

analytically several limiting cases: (i) interior perturbing planets with much
smaller periods; (ii) exterior perturbing planets on eccentric orbits with much
larger periods; (iii) both planets on circular orbits with arbitrary period
ratio but not in resonance; and (iv) planets on initially circular orbits
locked in resonance. Case (iv) is perhaps the most interesting case since some
systems are known to be in resonances and the perturbations are the largest. As
long as the perturber is more massive than the transiting planet, the timing
variations would be of order of the period regardless of the perturber mass!
For lighter perturbers, we show that the timing variations are smaller than the
period by the perturber to transiting planet mass ratio. An earth mass planet
in 2:1 resonance with a 3-day period transiting planet (e.g. HD 209458b) would
cause timing variations of order 3 minutes, which would be accumulated over a
year. These are easily detectable with current ground-based measurements. For
the case of both planets on eccentric orbits, we compute numerically the
transit timing variations for several cases of known multiplanet systems
assuming they were edge-on. Transit timing measurements may be used to
constrain the masses and radii of the planetary system and, when combined with
radial velocity measurements, to break the degeneracy between mass and radius

young, embedded sources, to emission in optically revealed stars, and to
complete absence in older debris disk systems for both low- and

around 10 um. Although most of the emission spectra show broad classical
features attributed to amorphous silicates, variations in the shape/strength
may be linked to dust processing, including grain growth and/or silicate
crystallization. We study quantitatively the evidence for evolutionary trends
in the 8--13 um spectra through a variety of spectral shape diagnostics. Based
on the lack of correlation between these diagnostics and broad-band infrared
luminosity characteristics for silicate emission sources, we conclude that
although spectral signatures of dust processing are present, they can not be
connected clearly to disk evolutionary stage (for optically thick disks) or
optical depth (for optically thin disks). The diagnostics of silicate
absorption features (other than the central wavelength of the feature),
however, are tightly correlated with optical depth.

due to high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) with contributions from inverse Compton
radiation, while the soft component is likely from a superwind. We also
detected extended X-ray emission from four extra-nuclear HII region complexes.
This emission may be due to HMXBs or to diffuse gas heated by winds from
supernovae, if the X-ray production efficiency L(X)/L(mech) is high (~5%). To
estimate L(X)/L(mech), we collected published data for well-studied HII regions
and superbubbles in nearby galaxies. For young HII regions (<3.5 Myrs), the
median L(X)/L(mech) ~ 0.02%, while for older regions, L(X)/L(mech) ~ 0.2-7%.
Thus gas heating by supernovae may be sufficient to account for the HII region
emission. In galaxies much more distant than NGC 7714, for example, the
Cartwheel galaxy, HII region complexes similar to those in NGC 7714 will be
unresolved by Chandra and will mimick ULXs.

general, the peak brightness location is coincident with the photocenter of the

dust is visible in half of the galaxies. The presence and strength of dust
correlates with nuclear emission. The prevalence of dust and its morphology
suggests that dust clouds form, settle to the center, and disappear repeatedly
on ~10^8 yr timescales. We discuss the hypothesis that cores are created by the
decay of a massive black hole binary. Apart from their brightness profiles,
there are no strong differences between cores and power-laws that demand this
scenario; however, the rounder shapes of cores, their lack of disks, and their
reduced color gradients may be consistent with it.

dusty torus covers a significant portion of the viewing angles to the accretion
disk and the BH. The system is classified as a type-I AGN if the accretion disk
is viewed through the opening part; otherwise it is called a type-II AGN.
Therefore the ratio of type-II to type-I AGNs serves as a sensitive probe to
the unification model. A surprising discovery made from several large sky
coverage and/or deep AGN surveys has found a significant anti-correlation
between the type-II fraction and the observed X-ray luminosity between 2-10
keV. This suggests two different luminosity functions for the two types of
AGNs, thus challenging the AGN unification model. However this observed
anti-correlation is a natural consequence of the AGN unification model with
only one intrinsic luminosity function if the inclination angle effects of the
X-ray emitting accretion disk are taken into account. Thus the AGN unification
model survived another critical test.

redshift of z~2.4. Removing obvious AGN, we find that the predicted H-alpha
star formation rates in this diverse population are suppressed (by ~10x)
compared to those derived from their far-infrared luminosities. We estimate
that AGN are present in at least 40% of the galaxies in our sample. To further
investigate this, we construct a composite rest-frame spectrum for both the
entire sample and for those galaxies which individually show no signs of
nuclear activity. We find [NII]/H-alpha ratios for both composite spectra which
suggest that the energy output of the galaxies is star-formation- rather than
AGN-dominated. The median H-alpha line width for our sample (removing obvious
AGN) is 400+/-70km/s (FWHM), and the typical spatial extent of the H-alpha
emission in our narrow-band observations is < 4-8kpc, which indicates a
dynamical mass of 1-2 x 10^11 Mo. This estimate is larger than recent estimates
of the dynamical masses of UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts derived in
an identical manner. We also compared our H-alpha and far-infrared luminosities

obscuration and actively-fueled AGN which are likely to be the progenitors of

far-infrared morphology of these dusty, luminous galaxies. In ~30% of the
sample the radio appears unresolved, suggesting that the emission is compact:
either an obscured AGN or nuclear starburst. However, in the majority, ~70%
(8/12), the radio emission is resolved by MERLIN/VLA on scales of ~1"" (10 kpc).
For these galaxies the radio morphologies are broadly similar to their
restframe UV emission seen by HST. We discuss the probable mechanisms for the
extended emission and conclude that their luminous radio and submm emission
arises from a large, spatially-extended starburst. The median SFRs are
1700Mo/yr occuring within a ~40kpc^2 region, giving a star formation density of
45Mo/yr/kpc^2. Such vigorous and extended starbursts appear to be uniquely
associated with the submm population. A more detailed comparison of the
distribution of UV and radio emission shows that the broad similarities on
large scales are not carried through to smaller scales, where there is rarely a
one-to-one correspondance. We interpret this as resulting from highly
structured internal obscuration, suggesting that the vigorous activity is
producing wind-blown channels through the obscuration in these galaxies. If
correct this underlines the difficulty of using UV morphologies to understand
structural properties of this population and also may explain the surprising
frequency of Ly-alpha emission in their spectra. [Abridged]

physical conditions ($T_{dust}$, $L$, $M$) and the chemical composition of each

$L_{submm}/L_{bol}$ ratio, the dust temperature and the molecular line

maser spots increased in flux density, no new spots developed and no changes in
morphology were observed. This rules out any mechanism which disturbs the
masing region itself, implying that the flares are caused by a change in either
the seed or pump photon levels. A time delay of 1--2 weeks was observed between
groups of maser features. These delays can be explained by light travel time
between maser groups. The regularity of the flares can possibly be explained by
a binary system.

K, Halpha and Na D as well as HeI 10830, 5876, 584 and HeII 304 AA lines have

models of the chromosphere and low transition region of an active region,
taking into account the estimated total number of photoionizing photons
impinging on the target active region and their spectral distribution. We
obtained a model that matches very well all the observed line profiles, using a
standard value for the He abundance ([He]=0.1) and a modified distribution of
microturbulence. For this model we study the influence of the coronal radiation
on the computed helium lines. We find that, even in an active region, the
incident coronal radiation has a limited effect on the UV He lines, while it
results of fundamental importance for the 5876 and 10830 lines. Finally we
build two more models assuming values of He abundance [He]= 0.07 and 1.5, only
in the region where temperatures are larger than 1.* 10^4 K. This region,
between the chromosphere and transition region, has been indicated as a good
candidate for processes that might be responsible for strong variations of
[He]. The set of our observables can still be well reproduced in both cases
changing the atmospheric structure mainly in the low transition region. This
implies that,to choose between different values of [He], it is necessary to
constrain the transition region with different observables, independent on the
He lines.

growth in the number of transistors on a chip requires spectacular reduction of
the transistor size. For electrons in semiconductors, the laws of quantum
mechanics take over at the nanometre scale, and the conventional wisdom for
progress (transistor cramming) must be abandoned. This realization has
stimulated extensive research on ways to exploit the spin (in addition to the
orbital) degree of freedom of the electron, giving birth to the field of
spintronics. Perhaps the most ambitious goal of spintronics is to realize
complete control over the quantum mechanical nature of the relevant spins. This
prospect has motivated a race to design and build a spintronic device capable
of complete control over its quantum mechanical state, and ultimately,
performing computations: a quantum computer.
  In this tutorial we summarize past and very recent developments which point
the way to spin-based quantum computing in the solid-state. After introducing a
set of basic requirements for any quantum computer proposal, we offer a brief
summary of some of the many theoretical proposals for solid-state quantum
computers. We then focus on the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal for quantum computing
with the spins of electrons confined to quantum dots. There are many obstacles
to building such a quantum device. We address these, and survey recent
theoretical, and then experimental progress in the field. To conclude the
tutorial, we list some as-yet unrealized experiments, which would be crucial
for the development of a quantum-dot quantum computer.

verify the main scaling properties expected for such a phenomenon, but we find
also somewhat unexpected very long transients before the asymptotic scaling
regions are reached. In particular, instead of the expected scaling $R\sim

less fast than $N^{1/2}$, even for extremely long chains.

limited set of sources by using traceroute-like probes. This methodology, akin
to the merging of different spanning trees to a set of destination, has been
argued to introduce uncontrolled sampling biases that might produce statistical
properties of the sampled graph which sharply differ from the original ones. In
this paper we explore these biases and provide a statistical analysis of their
origin. We derive an analytical approximation for the probability of edge and
vertex detection that exploits the role of the number of sources and targets
and allows us to relate the global topological properties of the underlying
network with the statistical accuracy of the sampled graph. In particular, we
find that the edge and vertex detection probability depends on the betweenness
centrality of each element. This allows us to show that shortest path routed
sampling provides a better characterization of underlying graphs with broad
distributions of connectivity. We complement the analytical discussion with a
throughout numerical investigation of simulated mapping strategies in network
models with different topologies. We show that sampled graphs provide a fair
qualitative characterization of the statistical properties of the original
networks in a fair range of different strategies and exploration parameters.
Moreover, we characterize the level of redundancy and completeness of the
exploration process as a function of the topological properties of the network.
Finally, we study numerically how the fraction of vertices and edges discovered
in the sampled graph depends on the particular deployements of probing sources.
The results might hint the steps toward more efficient mapping strategies.

provide an effective limit of quantum gravity in almost-flat regime. Some
experiments will soon be able to test some low energy effects of quantum
gravity, and DSR is a very promising candidate to describe these latter.
Unfortunately DSR is up to now plagued by many conceptual problems (in
particular how it describes macroscopic objects) which forbids a definitive
physical interpretation and clear predictions. Here we propose a consistent
framework to interpret DSR. We extend the principle of relativity: the same way
that Special Relativity showed us that the definition of a reference frame
requires to specify its speed, we show that DSR implies that we must also take
into account its mass. We further advocate a 5-dimensional point of view on DSR
physics and the extension of the kinematical symmetry from the Poincare group
to the Poincare-de Sitter group (ISO(4,1)). This leads us to introduce the
concept of a pentamomentum and to take into account the renormalization of the
DSR deformation parameter kappa. This allows the resolution of the ""soccer ball
problem"" (definition of many-particle-states) and provides a physical
interpretation of the non-commutativity and non-associativity of the addition
the relativistic quadrimomentum. In particular, the coproduct of the
kappa-Poincare algebra is interpreted as defining the law of change of
reference frames and not the law of scattering. This point of view places DSR
as a theory, half-way between Special Relativity and General Relativity,
effectively implementing the Schwarzschild mass bound in a flat relativistic
context.

the cosmological effects of vacuum energy. Non-static extra dimensions can
generally lead to a variable vacuum energy, which in turn may explain the
present accelerated cosmic expansion. We concentrate our attention in models
where the vacuum energy decreases as an inverse power law of the scale factor.
These models agree with the observed accelerating universe, while fitting
simultaneously the observational data for the density and deceleration
parameter. The redshift at which the vacuum energy can start to dominate
depends on the mass density of ordinary matter. For Omega = 0.3, the transition
from decelerated to accelerated cosmic expansion occurs at z approx 0.48 +/-
0.20, which is compatible with SNe data. We set a lower bound on the
deceleration parameter today, namely q > - 1 + 3 Omega/2, i.e., q > - 0.55 for
Omega = 0.3. The future evolution of the universe crucially depends on the time
when vacuum starts to dominate over ordinary matter. If it dominates only
recently, at an epoch z < 0.64, then the universe is accelerating today and
will continue that way forever. If vacuum dominates earlier, at z > 0.64, then
the deceleration comes back and the universe recollapses at some point in the
distant future. In the first case, quintessence and Cardassian expansion can be
formally interpreted as the low energy limit of our model, although they are
entirely different in philosophy. In the second case there is no correspondence
between these models and ours.

high-energy p-pbar collisions, such as at the Tevatron, bottom anti-bottom
production can be schematically categorized into three mechanisms. The
leading-order (LO) process is ``flavor creation,'' where both the bottom and
anti-bottom quarks substantially participate in the hard scattering and result
in a distinct back-to-back signal in final state. The ``flavor excitation'' and
the ``gluon splitting'' processes, which appear at next-leading-order (NLO),
are known to make a comparable contribution to total bottom anti-bottom cross
section, while providing very different opening angle distributions from the LO
process. An azimuthal opening angle between bottom and anti-bottom, Delta phi,
has been used for the correlation measurement to probe the interaction creating
bottom anti-bottom pairs. The Delta phi distribution has been obtained from two
different methods. One method measures the Delta phi between bottom hadrons
using events with two reconstructed secondary vertex tags. The other method
uses b-bbar --> (J/psi X)(l X') events, where the charged lepton (l) is an
electron or a muon, to measure Delta phi between bottom quarks. The bottom
anti-bottom purity is determined as a function of Delta phi by fitting the
decay length of the J/psi and the impact parameter of the lepton. Both methods
quantify the contribution from higher-order production mechanisms by the
fraction of the b-bbar pairs produced in the same azimuthal hemisphere,
f_toward. The measured f_toward values are consistent with both parton shower
Monte Carlo and NLO QCD predictions.

annihilation of Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles in a model of universal
extra dimensions (UED). This process gives a nearly mono-energetic gamma-ray
line with energy equal to the KK dark matter particle mass. We find that the
cross section is large enough that if a continuum signature is detected, the
energy distribution of gamma-rays should end at the particle mass with a peak
that is visible for an energy resolution of the detector at the percent level.
This would give an unmistakable signature of a dark matter origin of the
gamma-rays, and a unique determination of the dark matter particle mass, which
in the case studied should be around 800 GeV. Unlike the situation for
supersymmetric models where the two-gamma peak may or may not be visible
depending on parameters, this feature seems to be quite robust in UED models,
and should be similar in other models where annihilation into fermions is not
helicity suppressed. The observability of the signal still depends on largely
unknown astrophysical parameters related to the structure of the dark matter
halo. If the dark matter near the galactic center is adiabatically contracted
by the central star cluster, or if the dark matter halo has substructure
surviving tidal effects, prospects for detection look promising.

designed which incorporates gluon and diquark fields. The deconfinement
transition takes place when the diquark fields undergo Bose-Einstein
condensation. (ii) Rather than using eigenstates of the particle number
operator, I propose to perform simulations for a fixed expectation value of the
baryonic Noether current. This approach changes the view onto the finite
density regime, but evades the sign and overlap problems. The latter proposal
is exemplified for the LET: Although the transition from the confinement to the
condensate phase is first order in the coupling constant space at zero baryon
densities, the transition at finite densities appears to be a crossover.

N_f light quarks in the adjoint representation (aQCD). Renormalization-group
arguments show that the transition can be continuous if a stable fixed point
exists in the renormalization-group flow of the corresponding three-dimensional
Phi^4 theory with a complex 2N_f x 2N_f symmetric matrix field and
symmetry-breaking pattern SU(2N_f)->SO(2N_f). This issue is investigated by
exploiting two three-dimensional perturbative approaches, the massless
minimal-subtraction scheme without epsilon expansion and a massive scheme in
which correlation functions are renormalized at zero momentum. We compute the
renormalization-group functions in the two schemes to five and six loops
respectively, and determine their large-order behavior.
  The analyses of the series show the presence of a stable three-dimensional
fixed point characterized by the symmetry-breaking pattern SU(4)->SO(4). This
fixed point does not appear in an epsilon-expansion analysis and therefore does
not exist close to four dimensions. The finite-temperature chiral transition in
two-flavor aQCD can therefore be continuous; in this case its critical behavior
is determined by this new SU(4)/SO(4) universality class. One-flavor aQCD may
show a more complex phase diagram with two phase transitions. One of them, if
continuous, should belong to the O(3) vector universality class.

algebraic equation coupling the Dirichlet and the Neumann spectral values on
the perimeter of the triangle. As Lam\'e correctly pointed out, infinite series
are inadequate for expressing the solution of more complicated problems, such

its distribution. Using this, it is possible to derive scaling limits for the
points where these processes hit straight lines through the origin, and the
minimum distance from the origin that they can attain. The power of N that
gives the appropriate scaling is surprising. For example if T is the time that

tensor-diffusivity model of turbulent flows with an additional spatial filter
of width alpha ($\alpha$). We show the global well-posedness of this model with
constant Navier-Stokes (eddy) viscosity. Moreover, we establish the existence
of a finite dimensional global attractor for this dissipative evolution system,
and we provide an anaytical estimate for its fractal and Hausdorff dimensions.
Our estimate is proportional to $(L/l_d)^3$, where $L$ is the integral spatial
scale and $l_d$ is the viscous dissipation length scale. This explicit bound is
consistent with the physical estimate for the number of degrees of freedom
based on heuristic arguments. Using semi-rigorous physical arguments we show
that the inertial range of the energy spectrum for the Clark-$\aa$ model has
the usual $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov power law for wave numbers $k\aa \ll 1$ and
$k^{-3}$ decay power law for $k\aa \gg 1.$ This is evidence that the
Clark$-\alpha$ model parameterizes efficiently the large wave numbers within
the inertial range, $k\aa \gg 1$, so that they contain much less translational
kinetic energy than their counterparts in the Navier-Stokes equations.

solution of a system of nonlinear ODEs. Although the question of the global
existence of solution of this system remains open, it appears that this is the
first time in the literature that such a characterization is explicitely
described for a nonlinear evolution PDE defined on the interval; this result is
the extension of the analogous result of [4] and [6] from the half-line to the

provides a simple model of the above phenomenon. The physical situation
corresponds to the solution of the Dirichlet problem on the half-line, which
decays as $x \to \infty$ and which is {\it time periodic}. We show that the
Dirichlet problem, where the usual prescription of the initial condition is now

recently appeared in the literature. As an application of this methodology the
solution $q(x,t)$ of the sine-Gordon equation can be obtained in terms of the
solution of a $2\times 2$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. This problem is
formulated in the complex $k$-plane and is uniquely defined in terms of the so
called spectral functions $a(k)$, $b(k)$, and $B(k)/A(k)$. The functions $a(k)$
and $b(k)$ can be constructed in terms of the given initial conditions $q(x,0)$
and $q_t(x,0)$ via the solution of a system of two {\it linear} ODE's, while
for \emph{arbitrary} boundary conditions the functions $A(k)$ and $B(k)$ can be
constructed in terms of the given boundary condition via the solution of a
system of four {\it nonlinear} ODEs. In this paper we analyse two
\emph{particular} boundary conditions: the case of constant Dirichlet data,
$q(0,t) = \chi$, as well as the case that $q_x(0,t)$, $\sin (q(0,t)/2)$, and
$\cos(q(0,t)/2)$ are linearly related by two constants $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$.
We show that for these particular cases, the system of the above nonlinear ODEs

$\{a(k),b(k),\chi\}$ and $\{a(k),b(k), \chi_1, \chi_2\}$ respectively. Thus

Gaussian two-body operator of variable range, finding weak renormalization of
long range operators (e.g., quadrupole) in a fixed model space. This is
understood in terms of the two-body cluster approximation which accounts mainly
for short-range correlations. Consequently, short range operators, such as the

Acquisition System (XDAS) with the Xchip developed by the CCLRC.
  Studies concerning the collection efficiency dependence on the polarization
voltage and on the dose rate have been made in order to optimize the device
operation.
  In the first tests we have studied dose rate and energy dependences, and
signal reproducibility. Dose rate dependence was found lower than 2.5 % up to 5
Gy min$^{-1}$, and energy dependence lower than 2.1 % up to 20 cm depth in
solid water. Output factors and penumbras for several rectangular fields have
been measured with the linear array and were compared with the results obtained
with a 0.125 cm$^{3}$ air ionization chamber and radiographic film,
respectively. Finally, we have acquired profiles for an IMRT field and for a
virtual wedge. These profiles have also been compared with radiographic film
measurements. All the comparisons show a good correspondence. Signal
reproducibility was within a 2% during the test period (around three months).
  The device has proved its capability to verify on-line therapy beams with
good spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio.

treat the infinite wall as the limit of a solvable exponential potential.
Before the limit is taken, the corresponding $\*$-genvalue equation involves
the Wigner function at momenta translated by imaginary amounts. We show that it

  Short time decay of fidelity of initial Gaussian wave packets is also
studied, with respect to two time scales introduced in the semiclassical

group and its applications to both classical and quantum mechanics. We continue
the development of $p$-mechanics which is a consistent physical theory capable
of describing both classical and quantum mechanics simultaneously.
$p$-Mechanics starts from the observation that the one dimensional
representations of the Heisenberg group play the same role in classical
mechanics which the infinite dimensional representations play in quantum
mechanics.
  In this thesis we introduce the idea of states to $p$-mechanics.
$p$-Mechanical states come in two forms: elements of a Hilbert space and
integration kernels. In developing $p$-mechanical states we show that quantum
probability amplitudes can be obtained using solely functions/distributions on
the Heisenberg group. This theory is applied to the examples of the forced,
harmonic and coupled oscillators. In doing so we show that both the quantum and
classical dynamics of these systems can be derived from the same source. Also
using $p$-mechanics we simplify some of the current quantum mechanical
calculations.
  We also analyse the role of both linear and non-linear canonical
transformations in $p$-mechanics. We enhance a method derived by Moshinsky for
studying the passage of canonical transformations from classical to quantum
mechanics. The Kepler/Coulomb problem is also examined in the $p$-mechanical
context. In analysing this problem we show some limitations of the current
$p$-mechanical approach. We then use Klauder's coherent states to generate a
Hilbert space which is particularly useful for the Kepler/Coulomb problem.
