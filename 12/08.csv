towards a sample of 130 high-mass protostellar candidates with DEC<-30 deg.
This is the first step of the southern extension of a project started more than
a decade ago aimed at the identification of massive protostellar candidates. We
selected from the IRAS PSC 429 sources which potentially are compact molecular
clouds. The sample is divided into two groups: the 298 sources with
[25-12]>0.57 and [60-12]>1.30 we call 'High' sources, the remaining 131 we call
'Low' sources. In this paper, we check the association with dense gas and dust
in 130 'Low' sources. We find a detection rate of ca. 85% in CS, demonstrating
a tight association with dense molecular clumps. Among the sources detected in
CS, ca. 76% have also been detected in C17O and ca. 93% in the 1.2 mm cont.
Mm-cont. maps show the presence of clumps with diameters 0.2-2 pc and masses
from a few Msun to 10^5 Msun; H2 volume densities lie between ca. 10^{4.5} and
10^{5.5} cm^{-3}. The L(bol) are 10^3-10^6 Lsun, consistent with embedded
high-mass objects. Based on our results and those found in the literature for
other samples, we conclude that our sources are massive objects probably in a
stage prior to the formation of an HII region. We propose a scenario in which
'High' and 'Low' sources are both made of a massive clump hosting a high-mass
protostellar candidate and a nearby stellar cluster. The difference might be
due to the fact that the IRAS 12mu flux, the best discriminant between the two
groups, is dominated by the emission from the cluster in 'Lows' and from the
massive protostellar object in 'Highs'.

physical size encompassing a mean interior density ~ 5 times the critical
density, similar to the turnaround value in a classical Einstein-deSitter
model. We relate mhalo to other scales currently used to define halo mass
(m200, mvir, m180b) and find that m200 is approximately half of the total
asymptotic cluster mass, while m180b follows the evolution of the inner zero
velocity surface for a < 2 but becomes much larger than the total bound mass
for a > 3. The radial density profile of all bound halo material is well fit by
a truncated Hernquist profile. An NFW profile provides a somewhat better fit
interior to r200 but is much too shallow in the range r200 < r < rhalo.

measuring mass, age, radius, metallicity and luminosity data for brown dwarfs
in fully eclipsing binary systems around late K and early M dwarfs identified
by ultra-wide-field transit surveys. These surveys will monitor approximately a
million K and M dwarfs at a level sufficient to detect transits of low
luminosity companions. We look at the current observational evidence for such
systems, and suggest that about 1% of late K and early-mid M dwarfs could have
a very close BD companion. With this assumption, and using the SuperWASP
transit survey as an example, our simulation predicts that 400 brown dwarfs in
fully eclipsing binary systems could be discovered. All of these eclipsing
binaries could yield accurate brown dwarf mass and radius measurements. By
inferring the brown dwarf effective temperature distribution, assuming a
uniform age spread and an alpha=0.5 companion brown dwarf mass function, the
simulation estimates that brown dwarf brightness could also be measurable (at
the 10% level) for about 60 of these binary systems from the secondary eclipse.
Irradiation of the brown dwarfs will be below the 10% level for about 70% of
these systems, meaning that the measured brown dwarf brightnesses should
generally be the same as those of free-floating counterparts. The predicted age
distribution of the primaries is dominated by young systems, and about 20
binaries could be younger than 1Gyr. We suggest that many of these young binary
systems will be members of ``kinematic moving groups'', allowing their ages to
be accurately constrained.

use deep multicolor data in the Fors Deep Field (FDF; I-selected reaching

estimate stellar masses based on fits to composite stellar population models
for 5557 and 3367 sources, respectively. The MF of objects from the GOODS-S
sample is very similar to that of the FDF. Near-IR selected surveys hence
detect the more massive objects of the same principal population as do
I-selected surveys. We find that the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest
stellar populations at all redshifts. At low z, our MF follows the local MF
very well, extending the local MF down to 10^8 Msun. The faint end slope is
consistent with the local value of alpha~1.1 at least up to z~1.5. Our MF also
agrees very well with the MUNICS and K20 results at z<2. The MF seems to evolve
in a regular way at least up to z~2 with the normalization decreasing by 50% to
z=1 and by 70% to z=2. Objects having M>10^10 Msun which are the likely
progenitors of todays L* galaxies are found in much smaller numbers above z=2.
However, we note that massive galaxies with M>10^11 Msun are present even to
the largest redshift we probe. Beyond z=2 the evolution of the mass function
becomes more rapid. We find that the total stellar mass density at z=1 is 50%
of the local value. At z=2, 25% of the local mass density is assembled, and at
z=3 and z=5 we find that at least 15% and 5% of the mass in stars is in place,
respectively. The number density of galaxies with M>10^11 Msun evolves very
similarly to the evolution at lower masses. It decreases by 0.4 dex to z=1, by
0.6 dex to z=2, and by 1 dex to z=4.

which produces a constant-density core, while continuous infall pumps energy
into the halo to stabilize the core against gravothermal catastrophe. These
solutions improve upon earlier attempts to model the formation and evolution of
SIDM halos, offer deeper insight than existing N-body experiments, and yield a
more precise determination of the dependence of halo density profile on the
value of the CDM self-interaction cross section. Different solutions arise for
different values of the dimensionless collisionality parameter Q = s rho_b r_v
\~ r_v/l_mfp, where s is the scattering cross section per unit mass, rho_b is
the cosmic mean matter density, r_v is halo virial radius and l_mfp is the
collision mean free path. The maximum flattening of central density occurs for
an intermediate value of Q, Q_th, at which the halo is maximally relaxed to
isothermality. The density profiles with constant-density cores preferred by
dwarf and LSB rotation curves are best fit by the maximally-flattened (Q=Q_th)
solution. If we assume that dwarfs and LSB galaxies formed at their typical
collapse epoch in LCDM, then the value of s which makes Q=Q_th is s ~ 200
cm^{2}/g, much higher than previous estimates, s ~ 0.5-5 cm^{2}/g, based on
N-body experiments. If s is independent of collision velocity, then the same
value s ~ 200 cm^{2}/g would make Q>Q_th for clusters, which typically formed
only recently, resulting in relatively less flattening of their central density
profile and a smaller core.

hard X-ray (HXR) emission of a white-light flare on 2002 September 29. By
reconstructing the RHESSI HXR images in the impulsive phase, we find two bright
conjugate footpoints (FPs) on the two sides of the magnetic neutral line. Using
the thick-target model and assuming a low-energy cutoff of 20 keV, the energy
fluxes of non-thermal electron beams bombarding FPs A and B are estimated to be
1.0 10^10 and 0.8 10^10 ergs/cm^2/s, respectively. However, the continuum
enhancement at the two FPs is not simply proportional to the electron beam
flux. The continuum emission at FP B is relatively strong with a maximum
enhancement of about 8% and correlates temporally well with the HXR profile;
however, that at FP A is less significant with an enhancement of only about
4-5%, regardless of the relatively strong beam flux. By carefully inspecting
the Halpha line profiles, we ascribe such a contrast to different atmospheric
conditions at the two FPs. The Halpha line profile at FP B exhibits a
relatively weak amplitude with a pronounced central reversal, while the profile
at FP A is fairly strong without a visible central reversal. This indicates
that in the early impulsive phase of the flare, the local atmosphere at FP A
has been appreciably heated and the coronal pressure is high enough to prevent
most high-energy electrons from penetrating into the deeper atmosphere; while
at FP B, the atmosphere has not been fully heated, the electron beam can
effectively heat the chromosphere and produce the observed continuum
enhancement via the radiative backwarming effect.

Coronagraph (PIAAC) concept, which uses this technique, and we show that it
allows efficient direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets with a
small-size telescope in space. The suitability of the PIAAC for exoplanet
imaging is due to a unique combination of achromaticity, small inner working
angle (about 1.5 $\lambda/d$), high throughput, high angular resolution and
large field of view. 3D geometrical raytracing is used to investigate the
off-axis aberrations of PIAAC configurations, and show that a field of view of
more than 100 $\lambda/d$ in radius is available thanks to the correcting
optics of the PIAAC. Angular diameter of the star and tip-tilt errors can be
compensated for by slightly increasing the size of the occulting mask in the
focal plane, with minimal impact on the system performance. Earth-size planets
at 10 pc can be detected in less than 30s with a 4m telescope. Wavefront
quality requirements are similar to classical techniques.

tracer objects, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the former is possible because a
natural filter for removing many of the noise pairs is available: when counting
pairs of objects in order to create PSHs, only those with nearly identical
redshifts need to be counted. This redshift filter (a maximum value of $\Delta
z/z = 0.005$) was applied to a compilation of AGN catalogues. Further noise was
removed by applying a second filter, a maximum angle $\Delta \theta =0.075$
rad, and a minimum number of pairs $\protect\npairs=3$ to find each ``bunch of
pairs'' (BoP) where the {\em vectors} (in Euclidean comoving space) defined by
pairs are required to be nearly equal, whereas in the PSH only the {\em
lengths} must be nearly equal. These filters reveal significant signals, which,
however, are due to selection effects. A third filter, a minimum length
$\Lselec=150$ {\hMpc} between the (parallel) vectors in a BoP, is found to
effectively remove these selection effect pairs. After application of these
successive filters, no significant topological signal was found.

quantify the velocity fields with Fourier methods (kinemetry), and show that
the large-scale kinematics is largely consistent with axisymmetry. We construct
general axisymmetric dynamical models for the stellar motions using
Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition method, and compare the inferred
inclination and mass-to-light ratio with the values obtained by modelling the
gas kinematics. Both approaches give consistent results. However we find that
the stellar models provide fairly weak constraints on the inclination. The
intrinsic orbital distribution of NGC2974, which we infer from our model, is
characterised by a large-scale stellar component of high angular momentum. We
create semi-analytic test models, resembling NGC2974, to study the ability of
Schwarzschild's modelling technique to recover the given input parameters
(mass-to-light ratio and inclination) and the distribution function. We also
test the influence of a limited spatial coverage on the recovery of the
distribution function (i.e. the orbital structure). We find that the models can
accurately recover the input mass-to-light ratio, but we confirm that even with
perfect input kinematics the inclination is only marginally constrained. This
suggests a possible degeneracy in the determination of the inclination, but
further investigations are needed to clarify this issue. For a given potential,
we find that the analytic distribution function of our test model is well
recovered by the three-integral model within the spatial region constrained by
integral-field kinematics.

first series of such multi-group calculations undertaken in supernova theory
with fully multi-D tools. We find that though rotation generates
pole-to-equator angular anisotropies in the neutrino radiation fields, the
magnitude of the asymmetries is not as large as previously estimated. Moreover,
we find that the radiation field is always more spherically symmetric than the
matter distribution, with its plumes and convective eddies. We present the
dependence of the angular anisotropy of the neutrino fields on neutrino
species, neutrino energy, and initial rotation rate. Only for our most rapidly
rotating model do we start to see qualitatively different hydrodynamics, but
for the lower rates consistent with the pre-collapse rotational profiles
derived in the literature the anisotropies, though interesting, are modest.
This does not mean that rotation does not play a key role in supernova
dynamics. The decrease in the effective gravity due to the centripetal effect
can be quite important. Rather, it means that when a realistic mapping between
initial and final rotational profiles and 2D multi-group
radiation-hydrodynamics are incorporated into collapse simulations the
anisotropy of the radiation fields may be only a secondary, not a pivotal
factor, in the supernova mechanism.

considered. Such effects proved to be important to correctly reproduce the

contrary to what is observed for the parent homonuclear Cr8 ring, the symmetry
of the first excited spin states is such that anticrossing conditions with the

continuously with the strength of the coupling, scaling with an anomalous
exponent as one let the a-symmetry parameter go to zero. The specific heat
diverges logarithmically at the critical points (as for Ising) but the constant

The logarithmic divergence of the specific heat dominates only in an
exponentially small interval around the critical temperatures and outside it is

  To be published in the proceedings",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The Palatini formulation is used to develop a genuine connection theory for
general relativity, in which the gravitational field is represented by a
Lorentz-valued spin connection. The existence of a tetrad field, given by the
Fock-Ivanenko covariant derivative of the tangent-space coordinates, implies a
coupling between the spin connection and the coordinate vector-field, which
turns out to be the responsible for the onset of curvature. This
connection-coordinate coupling can thus be considered as the very foundation of
the gravitational interaction. The peculiar form of the tetrad field is shown
to reduce both Bianchi identities of general relativity to a single one, which
brings this theory closer to the gauge theories describing the other
fundamental interactions of Nature. Some further properties of this approach
are also examined.

waves from inspiralling compact binaries uses the post-Newtonian expansions of
the binding energy and gravitational wave flux both truncated at the same
relative post-Newtonian order. Motivated by the eventual need to go beyond the
adiabatic approximation we must view the problem as the dynamics of the binary
under conservative post-Newtonian forces and gravitational radiation damping.
  From the viewpoint of the dynamics of the binary, the standard approximation
at leading order is equivalent to retaining the 0PN and 2.5PN terms in the
acceleration and neglecting the intervening 1PN and 2PN terms. A complete
mathematically consistent treatment of the acceleration at leading order should
include all PN terms up to 2.5PN without any gaps. These define the 'standard'
and 'complete' non-adiabatic approximants respectively. We propose a new and
simple complete adiabatic approximant constructed from the energy and flux
functions. At the leading order it uses the 2PN energy function rather than the
0PN one in the standard approximation so that in spirit it corresponds to the
dynamics where there are no missing post-Newtonian terms in the acceleration.
We compare the overlaps of the standard and complete adiabatic approximants
with the exact waveforms for a test-particle orbiting a Schwarzschild black
hole. The complete adiabatic approximants lead to a remarkable improvement in
the effectualness at lower PN (< 3PN) orders. However, standard adiabatic
approximants of order $\geq$ 3PN are nearly as good as the complete adiabatic
approximants for the construction of effectual templates. Standard and complete
approximants beyond the adiabatic approximation are next studied using the
Lagrangian models of Buonanno, Chen and Vallisneri.

future galactic core-collapse supernova (SN) may be used to discriminate
between different neutrino mixing scenarios. Most SN neutrinos are emitted in
the accretion and cooling phase, during which the flavor-dependent differences
of the emitted neutrino spectra are small and rather uncertain. Therefore the
discrimination between neutrino mixing scenarios using these neutrinos should
rely on observables independent of the SN neutrino spectra. We discuss two
complementary methods that allow for the positive identification of the mass
hierarchy without knowledge of the emitted neutrino fluxes, provided that the
13-mixing angle is large, $\sin^2\theta_{13}\gg 10^{-5}$. These two approaches
are the observation of modulations in the neutrino spectra by Earth matter
effects or by the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope. If the value
of the 13-mixing angle is unknown, using additionally the information encoded
in the prompt neutronization $\nu_e$ burst--a robust feature found in all
modern SN simulations--can be sufficient to fix both the neutrino hierarchy and
to decide whether $\theta_{13}$ is ``small'' or ``large.''

string/gauge duality which predicts the power-law fall-off at high momentum

has important implications for hadron phenomenology in the conformal limit,

transparency, intrinsic heavy quark distributions, diffractive dissociation,

single-spin asymmetries, nuclear shadowing and antishadowing is also discussed;
these phenomena cannot be described by light-front wavefunctions of the target

competitive with the most conservative results from neutrinoless double

that such a rotating black brane is unstable against any massless (scalar,

the Gregory-Laflamme case. Likewise, this instability will have no effect for

its unusual properties with respect to charge conjugation and parity, it
belongs to a non-standard Wigner class. Consequently, the theory exhibits
non-locality with (CPT)^2 = - I. We briefly discuss its relevance to the
cosmological `horizon problem'. Because the introduced fermionic field is
endowed with mass dimension one, it can carry a quartic self-interaction. Its
dominant interaction with known forms of matter is via Higgs, and with gravity.
This aspect leads us to contemplate the new fermion as a prime dark matter
candidate. Taking this suggestion seriously we study a supernova-like explosion
of a galactic-mass dark matter cloud to set limits on the mass of the new
particle and present a calculation on relic abundance to constrain the relevant
cross-section. The analysis favours light mass (roughly 20 MeV) and relevant
cross-section of about 2 pb. Similarities and differences with the WIMP and
mirror matter proposals for dark matter are enumerated. In a critique of the

the modified pure spinors come out as moment maps for the symmetries of A and

into the mirror exchange of the A-model non-Lagrangian branes endowed with a
non-flat connection. Treating the connection as a distribution on an ambient

established by fiberwise T-duality.

family of so-called very simple trees (which include ordered trees, $d$-ary
trees, and Cayley trees); these form a subfamily of simply generated trees. At
each stage of the process an edge is chose at random from the tree and cut,
separating the tree into two components. In the one-sided variant of the
process the component not containing the root is discarded, whereas in the
two-sided variant both components are kept. The process ends when no edges
remain for cutting. The cost of cutting an edge from a tree of size $n$ is
assumed to be $n^\alpha$. Using singularity analysis and the method of moments,
we derive the limiting distribution of the total cost accrued in both variants
of this process. A salient feature of the limiting distributions obtained
(after normalizing in a family-specific manner) is that they only depend on
$\alpha$.

explained by a simple stochastic branching process previously studied by many
authors, the ETAS (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model which assumes that
each earthquake can trigger other earthquakes (``aftershocks''). An aftershock
sequence results in this model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past
earthquake. We develop the full theory in terms of generating functions for
describing the space-time organization of earthquake sequences and develop
several approximations to solve the equations. The calibration of the theory to
the empirical observations shows that it is essential to augment the ETAS model
by taking account of the pre-existing frozen heterogeneity of spontaneous
earthquake sources. This seems natural in view of the complex multi-scale
nature of fault networks, on which earthquakes nucleate. Our extended theory is
able to account for the empirical observation satisfactorily. In particular,
the adjustable parameters are determined by fitting the largest time window
$dt=1000$ days and are then used as frozen in the formulas for other time
scales, with very good agreement with the empirical data.

  Nuclear Energy","Total 9 pages including Figs. 1 & 2",,,"IET/MED/2004Dec.7","physics.gen-ph",,"  Recent observations on Type-Ia supernovae and low density measurement of
matter (including dark matter) suggest that the present day universe consists
mainly of repulsive-gravity type exotic-matter with negative-pressure often
referred as dark-energy. But the mystery is about the nature of dark-energy and
its puzzling questions such as why, how, where & when about the dark- energy
are intriguing. In the present paper the author attempts to answer these
questions while making an effort to reveal the genesis of dark-energy, and
suggests that the cosmological nuclear-binding-energy liberated during
primordial nucleo-synthesis remains trapped for long time and then is released
free which manifests itself as dark-energy in the universe. It is also
explained why for dark energy the parameter w = -2/3. Noting that w=+1for stiff
matter and w=+1/3 for radiation; w = - 2/3 is for dark energy, because -1 is
due to deficiency of stiff-nuclear-matter and that this binding energy is
ultimately released as radiation contributing +1/3, making w = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3.
This thus almost solves the dark-energy mystery of negative-pressure &
repulsive-gravity. It is concluded that dark-energy is a consequence of
released-free nuclear-energy of cosmos. The proposed theory makes several
estimates / predictions, which agree reasonably well with the astrophysical
constraints & observations.

applied the renormalization group method to obtain dynamical equations for the
slowly varying amplitudes of whistler waves. Further, it has been shown that
the amplitudes of eigenmodes satisfy an infinite system of coupled nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equations. In this sense, the whistler eigenmodes form a sort
of a gas of interacting quasiparticles, while the slowly varying amplitudes can
be considered as dynamical variables heralding the relevant information about
the system. An important feature of our description is that whistler waves do
not perturb the initial uniform density of plasma electrons. The plasma
response to the induced whistler waves consists in velocity redistribution
which follows exactly the behaviour of the whistlers. In addition, selection
rules governing the nonlinear mode coupling have been derived, which represent
another interesting peculiarity of our description.

its interpretation. In particular, an experiment cannot distinguish between the
Copenhagen interpretation (involving no hidden variables) and the de
Broglie-Bohm interpretation based on nonlocal hidden variables. Quantum
cryptographic protocols, such as BB84 or E91, are secure and mutually
equivalent as long as one works within the framework of Copenhagen
interpretation. But they are inequivalent and insecure if one considers attacks
allowed by the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation. The fundametal problem of
quantum cryptography is therefore this: Are all the statements about security
of quantum protocols based on our belief in one of the two allowed
interpretations of quantum mechanics? We show that this is not the case.
Ekert-type protocols can be modified in a way that makes them secure even if
the de Broglie-Bohm nonlocal hidden variables exist. Bennett-Brassard-type

arises naturally in situations where the speed of quantum operations exceeds
the limits imposed by the addressability of individual energy levels of the

the logical equivalence of different physical states and correspondingly, of
different physical transformations. This logical equivalence is a source of a
significant flexibility in designing logical operations, while the multilevel
structure inherently accommodates fast and intense broadband controls thereby
facilitating faster quantum operations. Another important practical advantage
of multilevel encoding is the ability to maintain full quantum-computational
fidelity in the presence of mixing and decoherence within encoding subspaces.
The formalism is developed in detail for single-qubit operations and
generalized for multiple qubits. As an illustrative example, we perform a
simulation of closed-loop optimal control of single-qubit operations for a
model multilevel system, and subsequently apply these operations at finite
temperatures to investigate the effect of decoherence on operational fidelity.

increasingly complex systems of both theoretical and experimental significance

entanglement, e.g. the fact that maximal information about a multipartite
quantum system does not necessarily entail maximal information about its
component subsystems, may be understood as specific consequences of the
phenomenon of complementarity extended to composite quantum systems. We also
present a local hidden-variable model supplemented by an efficient amount of
classical communication that reproduces the quantum-mechanical predictions for
the entire class of Gottesman-Knill circuits. The success of our simulation
provides strong evidence that the power of quantum computation arises not
directly from entanglement, but rather from the nonexistence of an efficient,
local realistic description of the computation, even when augmented by an
efficient amount of nonlocal, but classical communication. Finally, we note

information theory for the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In Part 1, the logical and conceptual status of various notions of
information is assessed. It is emphasized that the everyday notion of
information is to be firmly distinguished from the technical notions arising in
information theory; however it is maintained that in both settings
`information' functions as an abstract noun, hence does not refer to a
particular or substance (the worth of this point is illustrated in application
to quantum teleportation). The claim that `Information is Physical' is assessed
and argued to face a destructive dilemma. Accordingly, the slogan may not be
understood as an ontological claim, but at best, as a methodological one. The
reflections of Bruckner and Zeilinger (2001) and Deutsch and Hayden (2000) on
the nature of information in quantum mechanics are critically assessed and some
results presented on the characterization of entanglement in the Deutsch-Hayden
formalism. Some philosophical aspects of quantum computation are discussed and
general morals drawn concerning the nature of quantum information theory.
  In Part II, following some preliminary remarks, two particular
information-theoretic approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics are
assessed in detail. It is argued that Zeilinger's (1999) Foundational Principle
is unsuccessful as a foundational principle for quantum mechanics. The
information-theoretic characterization theorem of Clifton, Bub and Halvorson
(2003) is assessed more favourably, but the generality of the approach is
questioned and it is argued that the implications of the theorem for the
traditional foundational problems in quantum mechanics remains obscure.
