the fits, we set up a semi-empirical model sunspot characterized by two

which contains most of the mass, is more vertical than the minor component. The
field lines of the minor component are inclined below the horizontal plane
throughout the penumbra. Magnetic field lines and mass flows are parallel,
consequently, both upflows and downflows are present everywhere on the
penumbra. Major and minor components have very different velocities (several
hundred m/s for the major component versus 10 km/s for the minor component),
but the mass transported per unit time is similar. The similarity between the
vertical mass flow and the magnetic flux of the two components suggests that
field lines emerging as major component may return to the photosphere as minor
component. If so, the observed magnetic field strength difference between
components leads to a siphon flow whose magnitude and direction agree with the
inferred Evershed flow. Several tests support the internal consistency of the
retrieved model sunspot. The magnetic field vector {B} does not violate the
{nabla {B}=0} condition. The model sunspot reproduces the net circular

nearly as frequently in Mrk 501 as in Mrk 421 on any of the timescales. The
flaring hierarchy also seems apparent in Mrk 501, suggesting that it might be
common among TeV blazars. The results seem to imply a scale-invariant physical
origin of the flares (large or small). The X-ray spectrum of the source shows a
general trend of hardening toward the peak of long-duration flares, with
indication of spectral hysteresis, which is often seen in TeV blazars. However,
the data are not of sufficient quality to allow us to draw definitive
conclusions about spectral variability associated with more rapid but weaker
flares. We critically examine a reported sub-hour X-ray flare from Mrk 501, in
light of intense background flaring activity at the time of the observation,
and concluded that the flare is likely an artifact. On the other hand, we did
identify a rapid X-ray flare that appears to be real. It lasted only for about
15 minutes, during which the flux of the source varied by about 30%.
Sub-structures are apparent in its profile, implying variabilities on even
shorter timescales. Such rapid variabilities of Mrk 501 place severe

were found that adequately explained the observed variability, hence we
conclude that we have observed real intrinsic variability of the nuclear

is difficult to comment on the significance of this result. The observed short
time-scale continuum variability is consistent with NGC 4395 having an
intermediate-mass (~10^5 solar masses) central supermassive black hole, rather
than a very low accretion rate. Comparison with the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548

quasi-periodic bursting LMXB XB 1323-619 made with XMM-Newton in Jan., 2003. A
number of absorption lines were discovered in the spectrum, notably at 6.70 and
6.98 keV which we identify with scattering by ions Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. Such
features have been seen in other dipping sources, but their origin has not been
understood. Curve of growth analysis provided a consistent solution assuming
collisional ionization with kT=45 keV, close to the electron temperature we
previously determined for the ADC in this source. We thus propose that the
absorption lines in the dipping LMXB are produced in the ADC. Spectral
evolution in dipping was well-described by the progressive covering model which
we have previously shown to give very good explanations of many dipping
sources. We discuss the proposal of Boirin et al. (2004b), that spectral
evolution in the dipping LMXB may be explained by subjecting the continuum to a
highly ionized absorber. This would require a decrease in X-ray intensity by a
factor of ~3 in dipping at energies where photoelectric absorption is not
effective (40-100 keV) which previous analysis of BeppoSAX data on several
sources rules out, e.g. in XB 1323-619, any decrease was less than 10+/-10%. We
find a remarkable linear increase in the rate of X-ray bursts with time over
the 14-year period since 1989, and a systematic non-linear increase in source
luminosity (L). The linear variation of burst rate with L shows that the burst
rate is proportional to mass accretion rate, and if continued implies that the
gap between bursts will become zero on January 11, 2008. In reality we expect
the source to undergo a transition from X-ray bursting to X-ray flaring
confirming that flaring is unstable nuclear burning.

every fortnight. At each epoch, the pulsar DMs were obtained from simultaneous
dual frequency observations, without requiring any absolute timing information.
The DM estimates were obtained from both the single pulse data streams and from
the average profiles. The accuracy of the DM estimates at each epoch is ~ 1
part in 10^4 or better, making the data set useful for many different kinds of
studies. The time series of DM shows significant variations on time scales of
weeks to months for most of the pulsars. A comparison of the mean DM values
from these data show significant deviations from catalog values (as well as
from other estimates in literature) for some of the pulsars, with PSR B1642-03
showing the most notable changes. From our analysis results it appears that
constancy of pulsar DMs (at the level of 1 in 10^3 or better) can not be taken
for granted. For PSR B2217+47, we see evidence for a large-scale DM gradient
over a one year period, which is modeled as being due to a blob of enhanced
electron density sampled by the line of sight. For some pulsars, including
pulsars with fairly simple profiles like PSR B1642-03, we find evidence for
small changes in DM values for different frequency pairs of measurement, a

that we find significant differences in DM values obtained from average

intriguing recent discoveries concerning GRBs. It can have numerous
implications on our understanding of the emission mechanism of the bursts and
on the application of GRBs for cosmological studies. However, this relation was
verified only for a small sample of bursts with measured redshifts. We propose
here a test whether a burst with an unknown redshift can potentially satisfy
the EpEi relation. Applying this test to a large sample of BATSE bursts we find
that a significant fraction of those bursts cannot satisfy this relation. Our
test is sensitive only to dim and hard bursts and therefore this relation might
still hold as an inequality (i.e. there are no intrinsically bright and soft
bursts). We conclude that the observed relation seen in the sample of bursts
with a known redshift might be influenced by observational biases and from the
inability to locate and well localize hard and weak bursts that have only a
small number of photons. In particular we point out that the threshold for
detection, localization and redshift measurement is essentially higher than the
threshold for detection alone. We predict that Swift will detect some hard and
weak bursts that would be outliers to the EpEi relation. However, we cannot
quantify this prediction. We stress the importance of understanding the

these measurements have been made, the obstacles (the various foreground
emissions)and the physics behind the CIB and its structure. Theoretical
discussion of the CIB levels can now be normalized to the standard cosmological
model narrowing down theoretical uncertainties. We review the information
behind and theoretical modeling of both the mean (isotropic) levels of the CIB
and their fluctuations. The CIB is divided into three broad bands: near-IR,
mid-IR and far-IR. For each of the bands we review the main contributors to the
CIB flux and the epochs at which the bulk of the flux originates. We also
discuss the data on the various quantities relevant for correct interpretation
of the CIB levels: the star-formation history, the present-day luminosity
function measurements, resolving the various galaxy contributors to the CIB,
etc. The integrated light of all galaxies in the deepest near-IR galaxy counts
to date fails to match the observed mean level of the CIB, probably indicating
a significant high-redshift contribution to the CIB. Additionally, Population
III stars should have left a strong and measurable signature via their
contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies for a wide
range of their formation scenarios, and measuring the excess CIB anisotropies
coming from high z would provide direct information on that epoch.

collapse in three spatial dimension. A parametric equation of state is adopted
following Dimmelmeier et al. The early stage of the collapse is followed by an
axisymmetric code. When the stellar core becomes compact enough, we start a
3-dimensional simulation adding a bar-mode nonaxisymmetric density
perturbation. In the axisymmetric simulations, it is clarified that the maximum
value of $\beta \equiv T/W$ achieved during the stellar collapse and depends
sensitively on the velocity profile and total mass of the initial core, and
equations of state. It is also found that for all the models with high degree
of differential rotation, a funnel structure is formed around the rotational
axis after the formation of neutron stars. For selected models in which the
maximum value of $\beta$ is larger than $\sim 0.27$, 3-dimensional simulations
are performed. It is found that the bar-mode dynamical instability sets in for
the case that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the progenitor should
be rapidly rotating with the initial value of $0.01 \alt \beta \alt 0.02$, (ii)
the degree of differential rotation of the initial condition should be
sufficiently high, and (iii) a depletion factor of pressure in an early stage
of collapse should be large enough to induce a significant contraction for
which an efficient spin-up can be achieved. As a result of the onset of the
bar-mode dynamical instabilities, the amplitude of gravitational waves can be
by a factor of $\sim 10$ larger than that in the axisymmetric collapse. It is
found that a dynamical instability with the $m=1$ mode is also induced, but the
perturbation does not grow significantly and, hence, it does not contribute to
an outstanding amplification of gravitational waves.

background (UVB) that includes evolving stellar and QSO source populations. We
construct and analyze noiseless synthetic HI Lya absorption spectra along lines
of sight through our continuously evolving box and find a smooth evolution of
the effective optical depth under a power law up to the epoch of reionization.
Crossing into the epoch of reionization, both the mean transmitted flux (MTF)
and variance to the mean transmitted flux sharply deviate from a smooth
evolution and hence such observables have large margins of error. Despite the
statistical uncertainty in inferring the reionization profile from spectra, the
end of an opacity phase transition of the IGM correlates well with the redshift
when both the mean and variance of the transmitted flux rapidly deviate from
the post-reionization profile. However, an unobtainable number of lines of
sight is needed to allow an estimate of the MTF with less than 10% relative
margin of error. In addition to optical transmission, we compare the predicted
dark gap length distribution with observations. We show that this statistic is
sensitive to spectral resolution at reionization redshifts, but overall in
agreement with results by Songaila and Cowie (2002). Finally, we derive a
positive correlation between the mean optical depth within a gap and the size
of the gap, in attempt to relate ""transmission statistics"" to ""dark gap
statistics"" in high redshift studies of the IGM.

such supernovae would be bright enough to be readily detectable with the JWST
at any relevant redshift, the lower number densities derived here will likely
require either a dedicated wide-angle search strategy or a serendipitous
search. We expect that typically about 1 deg2 (or 500 JWST NIRCam images) per

about 35 deg2 to detect one at z ~ 25. If some Population III star-formation

order 1 deg-2 of surveyed area. In an Appendix, we consider the possible
effects of intergalactic dust in obscuring high redshift supernovae or other
high redshift sources. We show that the obscuration at a given rest-wavelength

Fundamental Plane scaling relations we deduce a modest luminosity evolution in
the B-band of 0.3-0.5mag for both samples. We compare measured Lick absorption
line strengths (Hdelta, Hgamma, Hbeta, Mg_b, & Fe5335) with evolutionary
stellar population models to derive light-averaged ages, metallicities and the
element abundance ratios Mg/Fe. We find that all these three stellar parameters
of the distant galaxies obey a scaling with velocity dispersion (mass) which is
very well consistent with the one of local nearby galaxies. In particular, the
distribution of Mg/Fe ratios of local galaxies is matched by the distant ones,
and their derived mean offset in age corresponds to the average lookback time.
This indicates that there was little chemical enrichment and no significant
star formation within the last ~5Gyr. The calculated luminosity evolution of a
simple stellar population model for the derived galaxy ages and lookback times
is in most cases very consistent with the mild brightening measured by the

calibrating infrared interferometric observations. In the K band, visibilities
can be calibrated with a precision of 1% on baselines up to 200 meters for the
whole sky, and up to 300 meters for some part of the sky. This work, extending
to longer baselines a previous catalog compiled by Borde et al. (2002), is
particularly well adapted to hectometric-class interferometers such as the Very
Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI, Glindemann et al. 2003) or the CHARA
array (ten Brummelaar et al. 2003) when observing well resolved, high surface
brightness objects (K<8). We use the absolute spectro-photometric calibration
method introduced by Cohen et al. (1999) to derive the angular diameters of our
new set of 948 G8--M0 calibrator stars extracted from IRAS, 2MASS and MSX
catalogs. Angular stellar diameters range from 0.6 mas to 1.8 mas (median is
1.1 mas) with a median precision of 1.35%. For both the northern and southern
hemispheres, the closest calibrator star is always less than 10 degree away.

goals are to study the solar magnetic dynamo and to determine the radiative and
magnetic properties of the Sun during its evolution across the main sequence.
The present paper focuses on the latter goal, which has the ultimate purpose of
providing the spectral irradiance evolution of solar-type stars to be used in
the study and modeling of planetary atmospheres. The results from the Sun in
Time program suggest that the coronal X-ray-EUV emissions of the young
main-sequence Sun were ~100-1000 times stronger than those of the present Sun.
Similarly, the transition region and chromospheric FUV-UV emissions of the
young Sun are expected to be 20-60 and 10-20 times stronger, respectively, than
at present. When considering the integrated high-energy emission from 1 to 1200
A, the resulting relationship indicates that the solar high-energy flux was
about 2.5 times the present value 2.5 Gyr ago and about 6 times the present
value about 3.5 Gyr ago (when life supposedly arose on Earth). The strong
radiation emissions inferred should have had major influences on the thermal
structure, photochemistry, and photoionization of planetary atmospheres and
also played an important role in the development of primitive life in the Solar
System. Some examples of the application of the Sun in Time results on
exoplanets and on early Solar System planets are discussed.

comprises 113 late-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.1<z<1.0 and thereby
probes galaxy evolution over more than half the age of the universe. Spatially
resolved rotation curves have been extracted and fitted with synthetic velocity
fields that account for geometric distortions and blurring effects. With these
models, the intrinsic maximum rotation velocity Vmax was derived for 73
spirals. By comparing our sample to the Tully-Fisher Relation of local spiral
galaxies, we find evidence for a differential luminosity evolution: the massive
distant galaxies are of comparable luminosity as their present-day
counterparts, while the distant low-mass spirals are brighter than locally by
up to >2mag in rest-frame B. This evolution would be at variance with the
predictions from numerical simulations. On the other hand, the disks of the
distant galaxies are, for a given Vmax, slightly smaller than those of their
local counterparts, as expected for a hierarchical structure growth. Hence, the
discrepancy between the observations and theoretical predictions would be
limited to the properties of the stellar populations. A possible explanation
could be the suppression of star formation in low-mass disks which is not yet
properly implemented in models of galaxy evolution. (abridged)

to the spin-boson model of dissipative two-level systems, where the interplay

in a rapidly rotating atomic trap is equivalent to charged bosons coupled to a
magnetic field, which has opened up the possibility of fractional quantum Hall
effect for bosons interacting with a short range interaction. Motivated by the
composite fermion theory of the fractional Hall effect of electrons, we test
the idea that the interacting bosons map into non-interacting spinless fermions
carrying one vortex each, by comparing wave functions incorporating this
physics with exact wave functions available for systems containing up to 12
bosons. We study here the analogy between interacting bosons at filling factors
$\nu=n/(n+1)$ with non-interacting fermions at $\nu^*=n$ for the ground state
as well as the low-energy excited states and find that it provides a good
account of the behavior for small $n$, but interactions between fermions become
increasingly important with $n$. At $\nu=1$, which is obtained in the limit
$n\rightarrow \infty$, the fermionization appears to overcompensate for the
repulsive interaction between bosons, producing an {\em attractive}

T^-1V^-x, where T is temperature, V the specific volume, and x a material
constant, are used to deduce the effect of pressure on the dynamic crossover
and the fragility. The crossover is determined from the change in slope of
derivative plots of the relaxation times or viscosities. We confirm our
previous findings that the value of tau or eta at the crossover is independent
of both T and P; that is, the dynamic crossover is associated with a
characteristic value of the relaxation time. Previous determinations were
limited to liquids having crossovers occurring at large values of tau (> 10
microsec), whereas by interpolating within T^-1V^-x space, we extend the
analysis to smaller values of the crossover time. Using the superpositioned
data, the dynamic crossover can be observed in isochoric data, where it is
found that the relaxation time at the crossover for constant volume is
equivalent to the value obtained under (the more usual) condition of constant
pressure. Similarly, from the scaling analysis, isobaric relaxation times at
high pressure are deduced from experimental measurements at atmospheric
pressure. We find for all glass-formers studied, that the fragility (normalized
temperature dependence of tau or eta) is a decreasing function of pressure.
This conclusion is less subject to uncertainties in the measurements than
published determinations of the pressure coefficient of fragility. Finally, we
show that an empirical function, having the form of the Cohen-Grest relation
but without connection to any free volume model, parameterizes the master
curves, and accurately describes the data over all measured conditions.

network accordingly difficult to properly secure. This paper surveys the
implications of this transition on security issues in telecom applications. It
does not give an exhaustive list of security tools or security protocols. Its
goal is rather to initiate the reader to the security issues brought to carrier
class servers by this revolution.

many practical applications. In this paper, we firstly present a goal-directed
fixed point computation strategy in the logic programming paradigm. The
strategy adopts a tabled resolution (or memorized resolution) to mimic the
efficient semi-naive bottom-up computation. Its main idea is to dynamically
identify and record those clauses that will lead to recursive variant calls,
and then repetitively apply those alternatives incrementally until the fixed
point is reached. Secondly, there are many situations in which a fixed point
contains a large number or even infinite number of solutions. In these cases, a
fixed point computation engine may not be efficient enough or feasible at all.
We present a mode-declaration scheme which provides the capabilities to reduce
a fixed point from a big solution set to a preferred small one, or from an
infeasible infinite set to a finite one. The mode declaration scheme can be
characterized as a meta-level operation over the original fixed point. We show
the correctness of the mode declaration scheme. Thirdly, the mode-declaration
scheme provides a new declarative method for dynamic programming, which is
typically used for solving optimization problems. There is no need to define
the value of an optimal solution recursively, instead, defining a general
solution suffices. The optimal value as well as its corresponding concrete
solution can be derived implicitly and automatically using a mode-directed
fixed point computation engine. Finally, this fixed point computation engine
has been successfully implemented in a commercial Prolog system. Experimental
results are shown to indicate that the mode declaration improves both time and
space performances in solving dynamic programming problems.

finite collection of (possibly weighted) constraints on overlapping sets of
variables, and the goal is to assign values from a given domain to the
variables so as to maximize the number (or the total weight, for the weighted
case) of satisfied constraints. This problem is NP-hard in general, and,
therefore, it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of
constraints affects the approximability of the problem. It is known that every
Boolean (that is, two-valued) Max CSP problem with a finite set of allowed
constraint types is either solvable exactly in polynomial time or else
APX-complete (and hence can have no polynomial time approximation scheme unless
P=NP. It has been an open problem for several years whether this result can be
extended to non-Boolean Max CSP, which is much more difficult to analyze than
the Boolean case. In this paper, we make the first step in this direction by
establishing this result for Max CSP over a three-element domain. Moreover, we
present a simple description of all polynomial-time solvable cases of our
problem. This description uses the well-known algebraic combinatorial property
of supermodularity. We also show that every hard three-valued Max CSP problem
contains, in a certain specified sense, one of the two basic hard Max CSP
problems which are the Maximum k-colourable subgraph problems for k=2,3.

properties of light or by new gravitational (G) tests and the Einstein's

the observer at rest in a G field, remain constants. The energy released during
the stops in different G potentials (GP) comes not from the G field but from
the bodies. The relative properties of the bodies at rest with respect to the
observer depend on the differences of GP between the bodies and the observer.
The increase of GP due to universe expansion expands bodies in identical
proportion. The universe age may be infinite. Its entropy is conserved because
the new black hole, without singularity, after absorbing radiation, explodes
regenerating new gas that transforms dark galaxies into luminous ones. Galaxies
evolve, indefinitely in closed cycles with luminous and dark periods. All of
their phases are found anywhere in the universe. They solve fundamental

The calculation of asymptotic expansions of the development of these initial

having spacetimes where future and past null infinity have different degrees of

supersymmetric U(1)' model. The neutralino sector has extra components from the
superpartners of the U(1)' gauge boson and the extra Higgs singlets that break
the U(1)' symmetry. The theoretical maximum bound on the lightest neutralino
mass is much smaller than that of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) because of the mixing pattern of the extra components. In a U(1)' model
where the U(1)' symmetry is broken by a secluded sector (the S-model), tan\beta
is required to be < 3 to have realistic electroweak symmetry breaking. These
facts suggest that the a_\mu prediction may be meaningfully different from that
of the MSSM. We evaluate and compare the muon anomalous magnetic moment in this
model and the MSSM and discuss the constraints on tan\beta and relevant soft
breaking terms. There are regions of the parameter space that can explain the
experimental deviation of a_\mu from the Standard Model calculation and yield
an acceptable cold dark matter relic density without conflict with collider
experimental constraints.

question, we consider a binary regression problem in detail and establish
frequentist consistency for a certain class of Bayes procedures based on
hierarchical priors, called uniform mixture priors. These are defined as
follows: let $\nu$ be any probability distribution on the nonnegative integers.
To sample a function $f$ from the prior $\pi^{\nu}$, first sample $m$ from
$\nu$ and then sample $f$ uniformly from the set of step functions from $[0,1]$
into $[0,1]$ that have exactly $m$ jumps (i.e., sample all $m$ jump locations
and $m+1$ function values independently and uniformly). The main result states
that if a data-stream is generated according to any fixed, measurable
binary-regression function $f_0\not\equiv1/2$, then frequentist consistency
obtains: that is, for any $\nu$ with infinite support, the posterior of
$\pi^{\nu}$ concentrates on any $L^1$ neighborhood of $f_0$. Solution of an
associated large-deviations problem is central to the consistency proof.

limits and reliability of the present interpretation of the screening
enhancement factor. In the present paper we discuss the simplest physical case
where the ES plays an important role in order to have unambiguous determination
of ES energy in a clear theoretical scenario. This is the case of alpha-decay
of heavy mass nuclei. We deduce the correct sudden and adiabatic limit for such
a system including the important relativistic corrections. Then we demonstrate
rigorously how in this case the calculation of the sudden and the adiabatic
limits leads to the same result. In order to get this result we use the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem. After computing the electron screening energy for
some systems we discuss the strong modifications of alpha-decay systematic due
to electron screening. We conclude proposing a measurement of alpha-decay
lifetime of bare nuclei in order to directly deduce ES Energy for heavy nuclei

of substorms is characterized by bursty, intermittent events that may arise
from turbulence intrinsic to the magnetosphere or may reflect solar
wind-magnetosphere coupling. This leads to a generic problem of distinguishing
between the features of the system and those of the driver. We quantify scaling
properties of short term (up to few hours) fluctuations in the geomagnetic
indices AL and AU during solar minimum and maximum along with the parameter
epsilon that is a measure of the solar wind driver. We find that self-similar
statistics provide a good approximation for the observed scaling properties of
fluctuations in the geomagnetic indices, regardless of the solar activity
level, and in the epsilon parameter at solar maximum. This self-similarity
persists for fluctuations on time scales at least up to about 1-2 hours. The
scaling exponent of AU index fluctuations show dependence on the solar cycle
and the trend follows that found in the scaling of fluctuations in epsilon. The
values of their corresponding scaling exponents, however, are always distinct.
Fluctuations in the AL index are insensitive to the solar cycle as well as
being distinct from those in the epsilon parameter. This approximate
self-similar scaling leads to a Fokker-Planck model which, we show, captures
the probability density function of fluctuations and provides a stochastic
dynamical equation (Langevin equation) for time series of the geomagnetic
indices.

stability is investigated by combining theory, experiment and simulation.
Although hydrogen bonds are major determinants of protein structure and
function, their contribution to protein stability is still unclear and widely
debated. The best method so far devised to estimate the contribution of
side-chain interactions to protein stability is double-mutant-cycle analysis,
but the interaction energies so derived are not identical to incremental
binding energies (the energies quantifying net contributions of two interacting
groups to protein stability). Here we introduce double-deletion analysis of
isolated residue pairs as a means to precisely quantify incremental binding.
The method is exemplified by studying a surface-exposed hydrogen bond in a
model protein (Asp96/Asn128 in apoflavodoxin). Combined substitution of these
residues by alanines slightly destabilizes the protein, due to a decrease in
hydrophobic surface burial. Subtraction of this effect, however, clearly
indicates that the hydrogen-bonded groups in fact destabilize the native
conformation. In addition, Molecular Dynamics simulations and classic
double-mutant-cycle analysis explain quantitatively that, due to frustration,
the hydrogen bond must form in the native structure because, when the two
groups get approximated upon folding their binding becomes favorable. We would
like to remark two facts: that this is the first time the contribution of a
specific hydrogen bond to protein stability has been measured from experiment,
and that more hydrogen bonds need to be analyzed in order to draw general
conclusions on protein hydrogen bonds energetics. To that end, the double
deletion method should be of help.
