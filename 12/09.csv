of high activity (CDInd, ANUMa and UWPic). The STIS spectra of the low-state

primaries. We have used pure hydrogen WD models to fit the FUV spectra of the
low-state systems (except RX J1554.2+2721, which is a high-field polar) in
order to measure the WD effective temperatures. In all cases, the fits could be
improved by adding a second component, which is presumably due to residual
accretion onto the magnetic pole of the WD. The WD temperatures obtained range
from 10800K to 14200K for log g = 8.0. Comparing the WD temperatures of polars
to those of non-magnetic CVs, we find that at any given orbital period the WDs
in polars are colder than those in non-magnetic CVs. The temperatures of polars
below the period gap are consistent with gravitational radiation as the only
active angular momentum loss mechanism. The differences in WD effective
temperatures between polars and non-magnetic CVs are significantly larger above
the period gap, suggesting that magnetic braking in polars might be reduced by
the strong field of the primary.

well an NFW profile with small perturbations due to substructure and is
compatible with the more model dependent analysis of Broadhurst et al. (2004a)

the mass distribution falls very close to the central cD and there is
substructure near the center suggesting that the cluster is not fully relaxed.
We also examine the effect on the recovered mass when we include the
uncertainties in the redshift of the sources and in the original shape of the
sources. Using simulations designed to mimic the data, we identify some biases
in our reconstructed mass distribution. We find that the recovered mass is
biased toward lower masses beyond 1 arcmin (150 kpc) from the central cD and
that in the very center we may be affected by degeneracy problems. On the other

well short of the anticipated virial radius. Our profile accurately matches
onto the inner profile, r<200 kpc/h, derived from deep HST/ACS images. The
combined ACS and Subaru information is well fitted by an NFW profile with
virial mass, (1.93 \pm 0.20)10^15 M_sun, and surprisingly high concentration,
c_vir=13.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}, significantly larger than theoretically expected
(c_vir~4), corresponding to a relatively steep overall profile. A slightly
better fit is achieved with a steep power-law model that has its 2D logarithmic
slope -3 and core radius theta_c~1.7' (r_c~210 kpc/h), whereas an isothermal
profile is strongly rejected. These results are based on a reliable sample of
background galaxies selected to be redder than the cluster E/S0 sequence. By
including the faint blue galaxy population a much smaller distortion signal is
found, demonstrating that blue cluster members significantly dilute the true

cataclysmic variables, and some active galactic nuclei, are expected to have
neutral gas which does not couple well to magnetic fields. The turbulent
viscosity in such disks must be hydrodynamic in origin, not
magnetohydrodynamic. We investigate the growth of hydrodynamic perturbations in
a linear shear flow sandwiched between two parallel walls. The unperturbed flow
is similar to plane Couette flow but with a Coriolis force included. Although
there are no exponentially growing eigenmodes in this system, nevertheless,
because of the non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, it is possible to have a
large transient growth in the energy of perturbations. For a constant angular
momentum disk, we find that the perturbation with maximum growth has a
wave-vector in the vertical direction. The energy grows by more than a factor
of 100 for a Reynolds number R=300 and more than a factor of 1000 for R=1000.
Turbulence can be easily excited in such a disk, as found in previous numerical
simulations. For a Keplerian disk, on the other hand, similar vertical
perturbations grow by no more than a factor of 4, explaining why the same
simulations did not find turbulence in this system. However, certain other
two-dimensional perturbations with no vertical structure do exhibit modest
growth. For the optimum two-dimensional perturbation, the energy grows by a
factor of ~100 for R~10^4.5 and by a factor of 1000 for R~10^6. It is
conceivable that these two-dimensional disturbances might lead to
self-sustained turbulence. The Reynolds numbers of cold astrophysical disks are
much larger even than 10^6, therefore, hydrodynamic turbulence may be possible
in disks.

disks, the viscous process which may drive the accretion in such systems is not
yet understood. While molecular viscosity is too small to explain the observed
accretion efficiencies by more than ten orders of magnitude, the absence of any
linear instability in Keplerian accretion flows is often used to rule out the
possibility of turbulent viscosity. Recently, the fact that some fine tuned
disturbances of any inviscid shear flow can reach arbitrarily large transient
growth has been proposed as an alternative route to turbulence in these
systems. We present an analytic study of this process for 3D plane wave
disturbances of a general rotating shear flow in Lagrangian coordinates, and
demonstrate that large transient growth is the generic feature of
non-axisymmetric disturbances with near radial leading wave vectors. The
maximum energy growth is slower than quadratic, but faster than linear in time.
The fastest growth occurs for two dimensional perturbations, and is only
limited by viscosity, and ultimately by the disk vertical thickness.
  After including viscosity and vertical structure, we find that, as a function
of the Reynolds number, R, the maximum energy growth is approximately 0.4
(R/log R)^{2/3}, and put forth a heuristic argument for why R > 10^4 is
required to sustain turbulence in Keplerian disks. Therefore, assuming that
there exists a non-linear feedback process to replenish the seeds for transient
growth, astrophysical accretion disks must be well within the turbulent regime.
However, large 3D numerical simulations running for many orbital times, and/or
with fine tuned initial conditions, are required to confirm Keplerian
hydrodynamic turbulence on the computer.

gravitational coupling G and the coupling of the skew field to matter. The
latter lead to an increase of Newton's constant at large galactic and
cosmological distances. For weak fields a fit to the flat rotation curves of
galaxies is obtained in terms of the mass (mass-to-light ratio M/L) of
galaxies. The fits assume that the galaxies are not dominated by exotic dark
matter and that the effective gravitational constant G runs with distance
scale. The equations of motion for test particles yield predictions for the
solar system and the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 that agree with the

explained without exotic dark matter. An FLRW cosmological model with an
effective G=G(t) running with time can lead to consistent fits to cosmological
data without assuming the existence of exotic cold dark matter.

Stars were selected with a colour and magnitude lying near the Fornax red giant

visible was a shell-like structure located 1.3 degrees NW from the centre of

about 12 and 27 per cent for the 50 (12) ACT (Planck) clusters considered. For
ACT, the error is dominated by beam smearing. In the Planck case the error in
the reconstruction is largely determined by the noise level: a noise reduction

(3D) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. It is found that ram
pressure due to the phase-dependent mass transfer from the Be-star disk excites
a one-armed, trailing spiral structure in the accretion disk around the neutron
star. The spiral wave has a transient nature; it is excited around the
periastron, when the material is transferred from the Be disk, and is gradually
damped afterwards. It is also found that the orbital phase-dependence of the
mass-accretion rate is mainly caused by the inward propagation of the spiral
wave excited in the accretion disk.

and have a linear resolution of <0.1 pc. Our radio data reveal a two sided
structure, with symmetric S-shaped jets emerging from a flat spectrum core. We
fit the jet brightness with gaussian components, which we identify from a
previous observation taken five years before. By comparing the positions of the
components in the two epochs, we measure motions between 0.45 +/- 0.14 and 3.76
+/- 0.65 mas, corresponding to apparent velocities < 0.2c, and to ages in the
range 8.3 - 65.8 years. Assuming that the radio morphology is intrinsically
symmetric and its appearance is governed by Doppler beaming effects, we find
that NGC4278 has mildly relativistic jets (beta ~ 0.75), closely aligned to the
line-of-sight (2 degrees < theta < 4 degrees). Alternatively, the source could
be oriented at a larger angle and asymmetries could be related to the jet
interaction with the surrounding medium. We also present new simultaneous VLA
observations between 1.4 and 43 GHz, and a 5 GHz light curve between 1972 and
2003. The radio spectrum can be fit by a relatively steep power-law (alpha =
0.54). We find significant variability at 5 GHz. All these arguments indicate
that the radiation from NGC 4278 is emitted via the synchrotron process by
relativistic particles accelerated by a supermassive black hole. Despite a much
lower power, this is the same process that takes place in ordinary radio loud
AGNs.

spectroscopic data on V4332 Sgr obtained in April-May 2003 at the SAAO. The
obtained spectrum shows an unusual emission-line component superimposed on an
early M-type stellar spectrum. The emission-line spectrum is of very low
excitation and is dominated by lines from neutral elemets (NaI, FeI, CaI) and
molecular bands (TiO, ScO, AlO). We also analyse all the observational data,
mainly photometric measurements, available for V4332 Sgr. This allows us to
follow the evolution of the effective temperature, radius and luminosity of the

V4332 Sgr can be accounted for by a gravitational contraction of an inflated
stellar envelope. The combined optical and infrared photometry in 2003 shows
that apart from the M-type stellar component there is a strong infrared excess
in the KLM bands. This excess was absent in the 2MASS measurements done in 1998
but was probably starting to appear in K in 1999 when the object was observed
in the DENIS survey. We interpret the results in terms of a stellar merger
scenario proposed by Soker & Tylenda. The infrared excess is likely to be due
to a disc-like structure which is either of protostellar nature or has been
produced during the 1994 eruption and stores angular momentum from the merger
event.

the forthcoming Planck satellite there is a need for all-sky complementary data
sets with arcminute resolution that can bring informations on specific
foreground emissions that contaminate the Cosmic Microwave Background
radiation. With its 4 arcmin resolution matching perfectly the high-frequency
bands of Planck, IRAS is a natural data set to study the variations of dust
properties at all scales. But the latest version of the images delivered by the
IRAS team (the ISSA plates) suffer from calibration, zero level and striping
problems that can preclude its use, especially at 12 and 25 micron. In this
paper we present how we proceeded to solve each of these problems and enhance
significantly the general quality of the ISSA plates in the four bands (12, 25,
60 and 100 micron). This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits
from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level
compatible with DIRBE, and from a better destriping. At 100 micron the IRIS
product is also a significant improvement from the Schlegel et al. (1998) maps.
IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well calibrated point sources
and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1 degree was
corrected for the variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and
brightness. The uncertainty on the IRIS calibration and zero level are
dominated by the uncertainty on the DIRBE calibration and on the accuracy of
the zodiacal light model.

dipole density. The corresponding dipole field can account for the magnitude of
observed exchange fields. At finite temeperatures localized surface (interface)

transport in completely disordered 2D conductors to the case of substantial
electron-electron Coulomb interaction. Such interaction may not only suppress
the average value of hopping current, but also affect its fluctuations rather
substantially. In particular, the spectral density $S_I (f)$ of current
fluctuations exhibits, at sufficiently low frequencies, a $1/f$-like increase
which approximately follows the Hooge scaling, even at vanishing temperature.
At higher $f$, there is a crossover to a broad range of frequencies in which
$S_I (f)$ is nearly constant, hence allowing characterization of the current
noise by the effective Fano factor $F\equiv S_I(f)/2e \left< I\right>$. For
sufficiently large conductor samples and low temperatures, the Fano factor is
suppressed below the Schottky value (F=1), scaling with the length $L$ of the
conductor as $F = (L_c / L)^{\alpha}$. The exponent $\alpha$ is significantly
affected by the Coulomb interaction effects, changing from $\alpha = 0.76 \pm
0.08$ when such effects are negligible to virtually unity when they are
substantial. The scaling parameter $L_c$, interpreted as the average
percolation cluster length along the electric field direction, scales as $L_c
\propto E^{-(0.98 \pm 0.08)}$ when Coulomb interaction effects are negligible

kinetically constrained models such as the East model is presented. The
treatment developed here is motivated by the expectation that slowly-relaxing
spin domains of arbitrary size govern the highly cooperative events that lead
to spin relaxation at long times. To account for the role of large spin domains
in the dynamics, a complete basis expressed in terms of domains of all sizes is
introduced. It is first demonstrated that accounting for single domains of all
possible sizes leads to a simple analytical result for the two-time single-spin
correlation function in the East model that is in excellent quantitative
agreement with simulation data for equilibrium spin up density values c greater
or equal to 0.6. It is then shown that including also two neighboring domains
leads to a closed expression that describes the slow relaxation of the system
down to c approximately 0.3. Ingredients of generalizing the method to lower
values of c are also provided, as well as to other models. The main advantage
of this approach is that it gives explicit analytical results and that it
requires neither an arbitrary closure for the memory kernel nor the
construction of an irreducible memory kernel. It also allows one to calculate
quantities that measure heterogeneity in the same framework, as is illustrated
on the neighbor-pair correlation function and the distribution of relaxation
times.

determined by the renormalized free quasiparticles, the distribution function

mean-field approach which allows for bosons to reside in several different

(Gross-Pitaevskii) the ground state of the system reveals a bifurcation
scenario at some critical values of the interparticle interaction and/or the
number of particles. At about the same values of the parameters the two-orbital
mean-field predicts that the system becomes two-fold fragmented. By applying
the three-orbital mean field we verify numerically that for the double-well
external potential studied here the overall best mean-field is achieved with
two orbitals. The variational principle minimizes the energy at a vanishing
population of the third orbital. To discuss the energies needed to remove a
boson from and the energies gained by adding a boson to the condensate, we
introduce boson ionization potentials and boson affinities and relate them to
the chemical potentials. The impact of the finite number of bosons in the
condensate on these quantities is analyzed. We recall that within the framework
of the multi-orbital mean-field theory each fragment is characterized by its
own chemical potential. Finally, the stability of fragmented states is
discussed in terms of the boson transfer energy which is the energy needed to
transfer a boson from one fragment to another.

some difficulties -- typically a failure to have access to information for
properly characterize the system -- for applying the full power of the standard
approach to the well established, physically and logically sound,
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. To circumvent such difficulties, in order to make
predictions on properties of the system and looking for an understanding of the
physics involved (for example in analyzing the technological characteristics of
fractal-structured devices) can be introduced large families of auxiliary
statistics. We present here a systematization of these different styles in what
can be termed as Unconventional Statistical Mechanics, accompanied of an
analysis of the construction and a clarification of its scope and
interpretation. As illustrations are derived heterotypical Bose-Einstein,
Fermi-Dirac and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, and several applications
including studies of experimental works are briefly described.

  Properties","20 pages, 18 figures",,,,"cs.NI math.ST stat.TH",,"  Network service providers and customers are often concerned with aggregate
performance measures that span multiple network paths. Unfortunately, forming
such network-wide measures can be difficult, due to the issues of scale
involved. In particular, the number of paths grows too rapidly with the number
of endpoints to make exhaustive measurement practical. As a result, there is
interest in the feasibility of methods that dramatically reduce the number of
paths measured in such situations while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
  In previous work we proposed a statistical framework to efficiently address
this problem, in the context of additive metrics such as delay and loss rate,
for which the per-path metric is a sum of (possibly transformed) per-link
measures. The key to our method lies in the observation and exploitation of
significant redundancy in network paths (sharing of common links).
  In this paper we make three contributions: (1) we generalize the framework to
make it more immediately applicable to network measurements encountered in
practice; (2) we demonstrate that the observed path redundancy upon which our
method is based is robust to variation in key network conditions and
characteristics, including link failures; and (3) we show how the framework may
be applied to address three practical problems of interest to network providers
and customers, using data from an operating network. In particular, we show how
appropriate selection of small sets of path measurements can be used to
accurately estimate network-wide averages of path delays, to reliably detect
network anomalies, and to effectively make a choice between alternative
sub-networks, as a customer choosing between two providers or two ingress
points into a provider network.

multiplexing efficiency gains for computing as the Internet provides for

efficient and low-latency way. A common solution is proportional share, where
users each get resources in proportion to their pre-defined weight. However,
this does not allow users to differentiate the value of their jobs. This leads
to economic inefficiency. In contrast, systems that require reservations impose
a high latency (typically minutes to hours) to acquire resources.
  We present Tycoon, a market based distributed resource allocation system
based on proportional share. The key advantages of Tycoon are that it allows
users to differentiate the value of their jobs, its resource acquisition
latency is limited only by communication delays, and it imposes no manual

breaking is very high, the requirement that the relic abundance of the Lightest
SuperPartner (LSP) provides the Dark Matter of the Universe leads to the
prediction of fermionic superpartners around the weak scale. This is no longer
obviously the case if the LSP is a hidden sector field, such as a Gravitino or
an other hidden sector fermion, so, it is interesting to study this scenario.
We consider the case in which the Next-Lightest SuperPartner (NLSP) freezes out
with its thermal relic abundance, and then it decays to the LSP. We use the
constraints from BBN and CMB, together with the requirement of attaining Gauge
Coupling Unification and that the LSP abundance provides the Dark Matter of the
Universe, to infer the allowed superpartner spectrum. As very good news for a
possible detaction of Split Susy at LHC, we find that if the Gravitino is the
LSP, than the only allowed NLSP has to be very purely photino like. In this
case, a photino from 700 GeV to 5 TeV is allowed, which is difficult to test at
LHC. We also study the case where the LSP is given by a light fermion in the
hidden sector which is naturally present in Susy breaking in Extra Dimensions.
We find that, in this case, a generic NLSP is allowed to be in the range 1-20
TeV, while a Bino NLSP can be as light as tens of GeV.

several free quantum field models. We present rigorous QEI bounds for a class
of interacting quantum fields, namely the unitary, positive energy conformal
field theories (with stress-energy tensor) on two-dimensional Minkowski space.
The QEI bound depends on the weight used to average the stress-energy tensor
and the central charge(s) of the theory, but not on the quantum state. We give
bounds for various situations: averaging along timelike, null and spacelike
curves, as well as over a spacetime volume. In addition, we consider boundary
conformal field theories and more general 'moving mirror' models.
  Our results hold for all theories obeying a minimal set of axioms which -- as
we show -- are satisfied by all models built from unitary highest-weight

theories. Our discussion of this issue collects together (and, in places,

of nucleon scalar and vector effective masses in the relativistic approach is
clarified. Only the vector effective mass is the quantity related to the
empirical value extracted from the analysis in the nonrelatiistic shell and
optical potentials. In the relativistic mean field theory, where the nucleon
scalar and vector potentials are both energy independent, the neutron vector
potential is stronger than that of proton in the neutron rich nuclear matter,
which produces a smaller neutron vector effective mass than that of proton. It
is pointed out that the energy dependence of nucleon potentials has to be
considered in the analysis of the isospin dependence of the nucleon effective
mass. In the DBHF the neutron vector effective mass is larger than that of
proton once the energy dependence of nucleon potentials is considered. The
results are consistent with the analysis of phenomenological isospin dependent
optical potentials.

bacterial genomes form two straight lines in 9-dimensional space: one line for
eubacterial genomes, another for archaeal genomes. All the 348 distinct
bacterial genomes available in Genbank in April 2007, belong to these lines
with high accuracy. The main challenge now is to explain the observed high
accuracy. The new phenomenon of complementary symmetry for codon
position--specific nucleotide frequencies is observed. The results of analysis
of several codon usage models are presented. We demonstrate that the
mean--field approximation, which is also known as context--free, or complete
independence model, or Segre variety, can serve as a reasonable approximation
to the real codon usage. The first two principal components of codon usage
correlate strongly with genomic G+C content and the optimal growth temperature
respectively. The variation of codon usage along the third component is related
to the curvature of the mean-field approximation. First three eigenvalues in
codon usage PCA explain 59.1%, 7.8% and 4.7% of variation. The eubacterial and
archaeal genomes codon usage is clearly distributed along two third order
curves with genomic G+C content as a parameter.

constituting molecules are chosen as a random sequence of N different types.
The same type of molecules experiences a hard-core (exclusion) interaction. We
study the robustness of the macromolecules with respect to breaking and
substituting individual molecules, using a 1/N expansion. The properties depend
strongly on the density of macromolecules. In particular, the macromolecules
are robust against breaking and substituting at high densities.

a unitary error basis. We consider this construction when the unitary error
basis is a nice error basis. We show that the number of resulting mutually
unbiased bases can be at most one plus the smallest prime power contained in
the dimension, and therefore that this construction cannot improve upon
previous approaches. We prove this by establishing a correspondence between
nice mutually unbiased bases and abelian subgroups of the index group of a nice
error basis and then bounding the number of such subgroups. This bound also has
implications for the construction of certain combinatorial objects called nets.

the Fourier transform on a group G which is (in general) non-Abelian. His
algorithm distinguishes between functions which are either perfectly balanced

we show that this algorithm (which we call the Deutsch--Jozsa--Hoyer algorithm)

Mechanics[1], for a particle subject to a potential undergoing a weak adiabatic
change, the time averages of the particle's positions typically differ markedly
from the ensemble averages. We Apply this result to the case where the weak
perturbing potential is the back-action of a measuring device (i.e. a
protective measurement). It is shown that under these conditions, most
trajectories never cross the position measured (as already shown for a
particular example in [3]).

in some multipartite purification schemes and it adequately represents
universal resources for measurement-only quantum computation. We focus in this
paper on the complexity of graph state preparation. We consider the number of
ancillary qubits, the size of the primitive operators, and the duration of
preparation. For each lexicographic order over these parameters we give upper
and lower bounds for the complexity of graph state preparation. The first part
motivates our work and introduces basic notions and notations for the study of
graph states. Then we study some graph properties of graph states,
characterizing their minimal degree by local unitary transformations, we
propose an algorithm to reduce the degree of a graph state, and show the
relationship with Sutner sigma-game.
  These properties are used in the last part, where algorithms and lower bounds
for each lexicographic order over the considered parameters are presented.

Suppose $U_{in}$ is an $\nb$-bit unstructured unitary matrix (a unitary matrix
with no special symmetries) that we wish to compile. For $\nb>10$, expressing
$U_{in}$ as a SEO requires more than a million CNOTs. This calls for a method
for finding a unitary matrix that: (1)approximates $U_{in}$ well, and (2) is
expressible with fewer CNOTs than $U_{in}$. The purpose of this paper is to
propose one such approximation method. Various quantum compiling algorithms
have been proposed in the literature that decompose an arbitrary unitary matrix
into a sequence of U(2)-multiplexors, each of which is then decomposed into a
SEO. Our strategy for approximating $U_{in}$ is to approximate these
intermediate U(2)-multiplexors. In this paper, we will show how one can
approximate a U(2)-multiplexor by another U(2)-multiplexor that is expressible
with fewer CNOTs.
