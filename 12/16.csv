billion years after allowing cooling to begin. The bar interacts with the disk,
transferring angular momentum and increasing its scale length. In none of the

exponential profile. Indeed within a few hundred parsecs to a kiloparsec from
the center the density rises much more steeply than in the rest of the disk,
and this is true irrespective of the presence of the bar.

how they fragment into stars, and it is suggested in this paper that the
low-mass stellar IMF, which appears to be almost universal, is determined
largely by the thermal physics of these clouds. In particular, it is suggested
that the characteristic stellar mass, a little below one solar mass, is
determined by the transition from an initial cooling phase of collapse to a
later phase of slowly rising temperature that occurs when the gas becomes
thermally coupled to the dust. Numerical simulations support the hypothesis
that the Jeans mass at this transition point plays an important role in
determining the peak mass of the IMF. A filamentary geometry may also play a
key role in the fragmentation process because the isothermal case is a critical
one for the collapse of a cylinder: the collapse and fragmentation of a
cylinder can continue freely as long as the temperature continues to decrease,
but not if it begins to increase. The limited available results on the
dependence of the thermal properties of clouds on metallicity do not suggest a
strong dependence of the IMF on metallicity, but the far-infrared background
radiation in starburst regions and in the early universe may significantly
shift the peak mass to higher masses in these situations.

disks consisting of solid cores with gaseous envelopes in contact with their
critical Hill spheres while accreting gas from the surrounding disk.We suppose
the luminosity derives from gas accretion alone.We label such models as type A
and follow their evolution which may occur on a time scale similar to the
protostellar disk lifetime until rapid gas accretion. We consider another set
of models, we label type B, with a free surface, powered by gravitational
contraction, while accreting through a disk.We find these models rapidly attain
a radius <~ 2x10^(10)cm without subsequent expansion.We speculate that giant
planet formation is initially described by models of type A, until at the onset
of rapid gas accretion, there is a transition to models of type B. Protoplanet
migration in standard models tends to be most effective near this transition
where it also changes from type I to type II.If a mechanism prevents type I
migration of low mass protoplanets, a rapid inward migration might occur near
the transitional mass regime. Such protoplanets would end up in the inner disk
regions undergoing type II migration and further accretion potentially becoming
sub Jovian close orbiting planets. Noting that dustier more massive cores spend
longer at a larger transitional mass where faster migration is expected, these
may be more prone to end in close orbiters.We find the luminosity of the
protoplanets during the later stages is dominated by the circumplanetary disk
and protoplanet disk boundary layer.For one Jupiter mass the luminosity range
is 10^-(1.5-4) L_sun$ depending on the evolutionary stage and external
conditions.

the lower ionization absorption and to the strong absorption produced by O VII
and O VIII at X-ray wavelengths. The O VI absorption extending from -140 to 60
km /s is associated with strong low ionization gas absorption and originates in
the Galactic thick disk / halo. This O VI appears to be produced by a
combination of processes, including conductive interfaces between warm and hot
gas and possibly cooling Galactic Fountain gas and hot halo gas bubbles. The O
VI absorption extending from 60 to 165 km /s has unusual ionization properties
in that there is very little associated low ionization absorption, with the
exception of C III. This absorption is not observed toward two foreground halo
stars, implying that it occurs in gas more distant than 3.5 kpc from the
Galactic disk. Over the 60 to 165 km/s velocity range, O VI and C III
absorption have the same kinematic behavior. N(O VI)/N(C III) = 10+/-3 over the
60 to 120 km/s velocity range. Given the association of O VI with C III, it is
unlikely that the high velocity O VI co-exists with the hotter gas responsible
for the O VII and O VIII absorption. The O VI positive velocity absorption wing
might be tracing cooler gas entrained in a hot Galactic Fountain outflow. The O
VII and O VIII absorption observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton may trace the hot
gas in a highly extended (~100 kpc) Galactic corona or hot gas in the Local
Group.

1999 paper and archival VLBA data-sets that have become available since 1999 to
produce a combined 28 epoch VLBA data-set on Mrk 421 spanning the years 1994 to
2002. No new component associated with the 2001 flares was seen on the total
intensity images, but the combined data-set allowed precise measurements of the
apparent speeds of the existing components. The peak measured apparent speed
was for component C5, which has an apparent speed of 0.1 +/- 0.02 c (H_0=71 km
s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Omega_m=0.27, and Omega_Lambda=0.73). No counterjet is seen
with a limit on the jet to counterjet brightness ratio J >~ 100. These observed
VLBI properties of Markarian 421 are consistent with a jet with a bulk Lorentz
factor of about 2 and an angle to the line-of-sight of about 1 degree,
suggesting a jet that decelerates between the gamma-ray producing region and
the parsec scale. The VLBI core and inner jet (component C7) have fractional
polarizations of about 5%, and an electric vector position angle (EVPA) aligned
with the jet axis. Component C5 (at 1.5 mas from the core) has a higher
fractional polarization of about 15%, and an EVPA nearly orthogonal to the jet
axis. Significant variability is detected in the EVPA of component C6, which at
two of the four epochs shows an EVPA aligned with the jet axis, possibly a sign
of propagating disturbances that are only visible on the polarization images.
If these propagating disturbances are linked to the 2001 gamma-ray high state,
then their inferred apparent speed is between 1 and 3 c.

study of a variety of ionization states of different chemical elements, with
resolution of the kinematics providing strong constraints on multiphase
properties. The six systems presented here include several that are likely to
arise from lines of sight through disk and halo structures of spiral galaxies.

with coronal structures that resemble that of the Milky Way, along with high
velocity clouds at 100-200 km/s. Another system has relatively weak CIV,
relative to the low ionization absorption, which leads to a discussion of the
circumstances in which a corona might be weak or absent in a galaxy, i.e. an
early-type morphology or low star formation rate. Finally, we present systems
that are examples of single-cloud and multiple-cloud weak MgII absorbers, which
are as a class not likely to be within ~50 kpc of luminous galaxies. Based the
physical conditions inferred from models, we discuss the nature of these types
of systems, which may trace outer regions of galaxies, dwarf galaxy satellites,

objects in these groups to below 10^7 M(sun) of HI, and was designed to search
for low mass, gas-rich satellite galaxies and potential analogs to the
high-velocity clouds seen around the Milky Way. This survey detected a total of
79 HI-rich objects associated with the six groups, half of which were new
detections. While the survey identified a small number of dwarf galaxies, no
star-free HI clouds were discovered. The HI mass function of the six groups
appears to be roughly flat as is that of the Local Group. The cumulative
velocity distribution function (CVDF) of the HI-rich halos in the six groups is
identical to that of the Local Group. Both of these facts imply that these
groups are true analogs to the Local Group and that the Local Group is not
unique in its lack of low-mass dwarf galaxies as compared to the predictions of
cold dark matter models of galaxy formation. This survey also constrains the
distance to and HI masses of the compact high-velocity clouds (CHVCs) around
the Milky Way. The lack of CHVC analog detections implies that they are
distributed within <160 kpc of the Milky Way and have average HI masses of
<4x10^5 M(sun). The spatial distribution of CHVCs is consistent with the
predictions of simulations for dark matter halos. Furthermore the CVDF of Local
Group galaxies plus CHVCs matches the predicted CVDF of cold dark matter
simulations of galaxy formation. This provides circumstantial evidence that
CHVCs may be associated with low-mass dark matter halos.

for the 2500-3500 K temperature range the temperatures that we derive from
synthetic spectral fits are higher than expected from more empirical methods by
several hundred K. In order to reconcile our findings with the empirical
temperature scale it is necessary to invoke warming of the model atmosphere
used to construct the synthetic spectra. We consider that the most likely
reason for the back-warming is missing high temperature opacity due to water
vapour. We compare the water vapour opacity of the Partridge & Schwenke (1997)
line list used for the model atmosphere with the output from a preliminary
calculation by Barber & Tennyson (2004). While the Partridge & Schwenke line
list is a reasonable spectroscopic match for the new line list at 2000 K, by
4000 K it is missing around 25% of the water vapour opacity. We thus consider
that the offset between empirical and synthetic temperature scales is explained
by the lack of hot water vapour used for computation of the synthetic spectra.
For our coolest objects with temperatures below 2500 K we find best fits when
using synthetic spectra which include dust emission. Our spectra also allow us
to constrain the rotational velocities of our sources, and these velocities are
consistent with the broad trend of rotational velocities increasing from M to
L.

directly associated to their nuclear emission -- and we measure the
corresponding 2.12 $\mu$m nuclear luminosities. Within the frame of the
unification scheme for radio-loud active galactic nuclei, it appears that
obscuration alone is not able to account for the different nuclear properties
of the majority of the HEGs and Broad Line Radio Galaxies (BLRGs), and also
scattering of the (optically) hidden nuclear light from a compact region must
be invoked. More precisely, for ~70% of the HEGs the observed point-like
optical emission is dominated by the scattered component, while in the K'-band
both scattered and direct light passing through the torus contribute to the
observed nuclear luminosity. The estimated fraction of scattered light ranges
from a few tenths to a few percent, while the torus extinction is between
15<A_{V,torus}<50 mag with only a few exceptions with lower obscuration.

closely approximated by two Gaussians containing 89% and 11% of the stars,
respectively: the first component is centered at [Fe/H] = -0.37 with standard

not strong, but there is no evidence that the bar deviates from the general
motion of the LMC disk. The velocity dispersion of the whole sample is 24.7 +/-
0.4 km/sec. The most metal-poor 5% of stars ([Fe/H] < -1.15) show a dispersion

erg cm-2 s-1. We find evidence for hardening of the average X-ray spectra of
the sources towards fainter fluxes. We interpret this as indicating a higher
degree of photoelectric absorption amongst the fainter population. Absorption
is detected at 95% confidence in 20% of the sources, but it could certainly be
present in many other sources below our detection capabilities. For Broad Line
AGNs (BLAGNs), we detect absorption in ~10% of the sources with column
densities in the range 10E21 - 10E22 cm-2. The fraction of absorbed Narrow
Emission Line galaxies (NELGs, most with intrinsic X-ray luminosities >10E43
erg s-1, and therefore classified as type 2 AGNs) is significantly higher
(40%), with a hint of moderately higher columns. We do not find evidence for a
redshift evolution of the underlying power law index of BLAGNs, which stays
roughly constant at Gamma ~1.9, with intrinsic dispersion of 0.4. A small
fraction (~7%) of BLAGNs and NELGs require the presence of a soft excess, that
we model as a black body with temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 keV.
Comparing our results on absorption to popular X-ray background synthesis
models, we find absorption in only ~40% of the sources expected. This is due to
a deficiency of heavily absorbed sources (with NH ~10E22 - 10E24 cm-2) in our
sample in comparison with the models. We therefore conclude that the synthesis
models require some revision in their specific parameters.

can not exceed 30-40% of the total mass within 35 kpc if the Milky Way warp

enrichment is computed, motivated by the recent observations of very
Fe-deficient stars, [Fe/H]~10^{-3.5}-10^{-5}, such as HE 0107-5240 and CS
29498-043. These stars are overabundant, relative to Fe, in C and O. We assume
that the observed abundances of species like C, O, Si and Fe are representative
of the gas from which the currently observed metal-deficient stars formed.
Under this assumption, we find that this primordial metal abundance pattern has
profound consequences for the thermal balance and chemical composition of the
gas, and hence for the EOS of the parental cloud. The polytopic EOS is soft for
low, [O/H]<10^{-3}, oxygen abundances, but stiffens to a polytropic index gamma
large than unity for [O/H]>10^{-2} due to the large opacity in the CO and H2O
cooling lines. It is further found that a regulating role is played by the
presence and temperature of the dust, even when the overall carbon abundance is
only [C/H]~10^{-2}. When the dust is warmer than the gas, a region with
gamma~1.2 results around a density of ~10^4 cm^{-3}. When the dust is colder
than the gas, a region with gamma~0.8 is found for a density of ~10^6 cm^{-3}.
Implications for the primordial initial mass function (IMF) as well as the IMF
in starburst galaxies, where the metallicity is super-solar, are explored and
related to processes that influence the temperature of the ambient dust.

of the VLBI jet in the BL Lac object 0716+714 over the last 10 years. We show
VLBI images obtained at 5 GHz, 8.4 GHz, 15 GHz and 22 GHz. The milliarcsecond
source structure is best described by a one-sided core-dominated jet of ~10 mas
length. Embedded jet components move superluminally with speeds ranging from 5
c to 16 c (assuming z=0.3). Such fast superluminal motion is not typical for BL
Lac objects, however it is still in the range of jet speeds typically observed
in quasars (10 c to 20 c). In 0716+714, younger components, that were ejected
more recently, seem to move systematically slower than the older components.
This and a systematic position angle variation of the inner (1 mas) portion of
the VLBI jet, suggests an at least partly geometric origin of the observed
velocity variations. The observed rapid motion and the derived Lorentz factors
are discussed with regard to the rapid Intra-Day Variability (IDV) and the
gamma-ray observations, from which very high Doppler factors are inferred.

spin-flip conversion of neutrinos propagating in a gravitational field of a
protoneutron star. For a rotating gravitational source (such as pulsars) with
angular velocity ${\bm \omega}$, one finds that the spin connections (entering
in the Dirac equation written in curved space time) induce an additional
contribution to neutrino energy which is proportional to ${\bm \omega}\cdot
{\bf p}$, with ${\bf p}$ the neutrino momentum. Such a coupling (spin-gravity
coupling) can be responsible of pulsar kicks being the asymmetry of the
neutrino emission generated by the relative orientation of the neutrino
momentum ${\bf p}$ with respect to the angular velocity ${\bm \omega}$. As a
consequence, the mechanism suggests that the motion of pulsars is correlated to
their angular velocity ${\bm \omega}$. In this work we consider neutrinos
propagating orthogonally to the magnetic field. As in the usual approaches,spin
flip conversion is generated via the coupling of the neutrino magnetic momentum
with the magnetic field. For our estimations, we use the large non-standard
neutrino magnetic momentum provided by astrophysical and cosmological
constraints, $\mu_\nu\sim 10^{-11}\mu_B$. The connection with recent
observations and statistical analysis is also discussed.

compatible with a biconical structure of ionization induced by strong
extinction in the galaxy disc that also obscures half of the spheroidal stellar
bulge. We identify the spectrum corresponding to the Seyfert 1 nucleus from the
presence of H$\beta$ broad emission lines. This spectrum is located in a region
where strong extinction is expected but exhibits the bluest spectral energy
distribution. The Seyfert 1 nucleus seems to be offcenter with respect to the
stellar rotation center. This result has been also found in other Seyfert

indicate the presence of nonsymmetric departures in the gravitational potential

haloes around galaxies assemble through successive mergers with smaller haloes.
This merging process is not completely efficient, and hundreds of surviving
halo cores, or {\it subhaloes}, are expected to remain in orbit within the halo
of a galaxy like the Milky Way. While the dozen visible satellites of the Milky
Way may trace some of these subhaloes, the majority are currently undetected. A
large number of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) of neutral hydrogen {\it are}
observed around the Milky Way, and it is plausible that some of the HVCs may
trace subhaloes undetected in the optical. Confirming the existence of
concentrations of dark matter associated with even a few of the HVCs would
represent a dramatic step forward in our attempts to understand the nature of
dark matter. Supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the Standard Model of particle
physics currently suggest neutralinos as a natural well-motivated candidate for
the non-baryonic dark matter of the universe. If this is indeed the case, then
it may be possible to detect dark matter indirectly as it annihilates into
neutrinos, photons or positrons. In particular, the centres of subhaloes might
show up as point sources in gamma-ray observations. In this work we consider
the possibility that some of the unidentified EGRET $\gamma$-ray sources trace
annihilating neutralino dark matter in the dark substructure of the Local
Group. We compare the observed positions and fluxes of both the unidentified
EGRET sources and the HVCs with the positions and fluxes predicted by a model
of halo substructure, to determine to what extent any of these three
populations could be associated.

oscillations (defined as the ratio of the frequency of the QPO peak to its full
width at half maximum). In order to minimise the effect of long-term frequency
drifts, power spectra were computed over the shortest times permitted by the
data statistics. We show that the high Q of ~200 reported by Berger et al.
(1996) for the lower frequency kilo-Hz QPO in one of their observations is by
no means exceptional, as we observe a mean Q value in excess of 150 in 14 out
of the 21 observations analysed and Q can remain above 200 for thousands of
seconds. The frequency of the QPO varies over the wide range 560--890 Hz and we
find a systematic trend for the coherence time of the QPO, estimated as tau=Q
/(pi nu), to increase with the frequency, up to a maximum level at ~ 800 Hz,
beyond which it appears to decrease, at frequencies where the QPO weakens.
There is a more complex relationship between tau and the QPO root mean squared
amplitude (RMS), in which positive and negative correlations can be found. A
higher-frequency QPO, revealed by correcting for the frequency drift of the
560-890 Hz one, has a much lower Q (~10) which does not follow the same
pattern. We discuss these results in the framework of competing QPO models and
show that those involving clumps orbiting within or above the accretion disk

the pregalactic production of the Li6 isotope can account for the Li6 plateau
observed in metal poor halo stars without additional over-production of Li7.
The derived relation between the amplitude of the CCR energy spectra and the
redshift of the initial CCR production puts constraints on the physics and
history of the objects, such as pop III stars, responsible for these early
cosmic rays. Consequently, we consider the evolution of Li6 in the Galaxy.
Since Li6 is also produced in Galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis, we argue
that halo stars with metallicities between [Fe/H] = -2 and -1, must be somewhat
depleted in Li6.

correlation functions of certain operators exhibit $\omega/T$ scaling, they do
not show analogous scaling in space. In particular, in the scaling limit, all
such correlators are purely {\em local} in space, although the same correlators
at T=0 decay as a power law. This provides a valuable microscopic example of a
certain kind of `local' quantum criticality. The local form of the correlations
arise from the large density of soft modes present near the transition that are
excited by temperature. We calculate exactly the autocorrelation function for
such operators in the scaling limit. Going beyond the scaling limit by
including irrelevant operators leads to finite spatial correlations which are
also obtained.

pressure were carried out on poly(oxybutylene) (POB), a type-A polymer
(dielectrically-active normal mode). There are three dynamic processes
appearing at lower frequency, the normal and segmental relaxation modes, and a
conductivity arising from ionic impurities. In combination with
pressure-volume-temperature measurements, the dielectric data were used to
assess the respective roles of thermal energy and density in controlling the
relaxation times and their variation with T and P. We find that the local
segmental and the global relaxation times are both a single function of the
product of the temperature times the specific volume, with the latter raised to
the power of 2.65. The fact that this scaling exponent is the same for both
modes indicates they are governed by the same local friction coefficient, an
idea common to most models of polymer dynamics. Nevertheless, near Tg, their
temperature dependences diverge. The magnitude of the scaling exponent reflects
the relatively weak effect of density on the relaxation times. This is usual
for polymers, as the intramolecular bonding, and thus interactions between
directly bonded segments, are only weakly sensitive to pressure. This
insensitivity also means that the chain end-to-end distance is invariant to P,
conferring a near pressure-independence of the (density-normalized) normal mode
dielectric strength.

that, if a continuum limit is taken to obtain a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for
the transfer matrix, as in some previous work, then when there are more than
two scattering channels, all terms that break a certain symmetry are lost. It
was already known that the resulting FP equation exhibits critical behavior.
The additional symmetry is not required by the definition of the symmetry
classes; terms that break it arise from non-Gaussian probability distributions,
and may be kept in a generalized FP equation. We show that they lead to
localization in a long wire. When the wire has more than two scattering
channels, these terms are irrelevant at the short distance (diffusive or
ballistic) fixed point, but as they are relevant at the long-distance critical
fixed point, they are termed dangerously irrelevant. We confirm the results in
a supersymmetry approach for class BD, where the additional terms correspond to
jumps between the two components of the sigma model target space. We consider
the effect of random $\pi$ fluxes, which prevent the system localizing. We show

due to the one-dimensional diffusion-like motion of backbone conformational

integer multiples of the mechanical frequency, which is slightly renormalized.
The renormalization explains a previously observed small deviation of the
shuttle current compared to the expected value given by the product of the
natural mechanical frequency and the electron charge. For a certain parameter
range the quantum shuttle exhibits a coexistence regime, where the charges are
transported by two different mechanisms: shuttling and sequential tunneling. In
our previous studies we showed that characteristic features in the
zero-frequency noise could be quantitatively understood as a slow switching
process between the two current channels, and the present study shows that this
interpretation holds also qualitatively at finite frequency.

x=0.5. Compared to this, the long range order in samples with x=0.55 and x=0.6
have a distinct change in wavevector and correlation. We attribute this to a
new orbital bi-stripe phase, accompanied by weak, frustrated, charge ordering.
The observed azimuthal dependence of the orbital order reflections supports the
model proposed for this new phase.

framework to interpret DSR. We extend the principle of relativity: the same way
that Special Relativity showed us that the definition of a reference frame
requires to specify its speed, we show that DSR implies that we must also take
into account its mass. We further advocate a 5-dimensional point of view on DSR
physics and the extension of the kinematical symmetry from the Poincare group
to the Poincare-de Sitter group (ISO(4,1)). This leads us to introduce the
concept of a pentamomentum and to take into account the renormalization of the
DSR deformation parameter kappa. This allows the resolution of the ""soccer ball
problem"" (definition of many-particle-states) and provides a physical
interpretation of the non-commutativity and non-associativity of the addition
the relativistic quadrimomentum.

assumptions. Under the condition that $\omega_0=2\bar{\Lambda}$, the solutions
for the B-meson wavefunction in this paper agree well with the one obtained by
directly taking the heavy quark limit $m_b\to\infty$. Our results show that the
equation of motion of the light spectator quark in the B meson can impose a
strong constraint on the B-meson wavefunctions $\Psi_\pm(\omega,z^2)$. Based on
the obtained results, we claim that both its distribution amplitudes
$\phi_B(\omega)$ and $\bar\phi_B(\omega)$ are important for calculating the B
meson decays.

functions of commuting and anticommuting (Grassmannian) variables. These new
functions, called symmetric functions in superspace, are invariant under the
diagonal action of the symmetric group acting on the sets of commuting and
anticommuting variables. We first obtain superspace analogues of a number of
standard objects and concepts in the theory of symmetric functions: partitions,
monomials, elementary symmetric functions, completely symmetric functions,
power sums, involutions, generating functions, Cauchy formulas, and scalar
products. We then consider a one-parameter extension of the combinatorial
scalar product. It provides the natural setting for the definition of a family
of ``combinatorial'' orthogonal Jack polynomials in superspace. We show that
this family coincides with that of ``physical'' Jack polynomials in superspace
that were previously introduced by the authors as orthogonal eigenfunctions of
a supersymmetric quantum mechanical many-body problem. The equivalence of the
two families is established by showing that the ``physical'' Jack polynomials
are also orthogonal with respect to the combinatorial scalar product. This
equivalence is also directly demonstrated for particular values of the free
parameter.

submanifolds of S^n. We find that the condition for the conormal bundle to be

submanifolds in complete metrics with special holonomy G_2 and Spin(7)
discovered by Bryant and Salamon on the total spaces of appropriate bundles
over self-dual Einstein four manifolds. The submanifolds are constructed as
certain subbundles over immersed surfaces. We show that this construction
requires the surface to be minimal in the associative and Cayley cases, and to
be (properly oriented) real isotropic in the coassociative case. We also make
some remarks about using these constructions as a possible local model for the
intersection of compact calibrated submanifolds in a compact manifold with

and relativistic effective interactions. In the relativistic case the role of
the isovector scalar $\delta$-meson is stressed. The qualitative new features
of the liquid-gas phase transition, ""diffusive"" instability and isospin
distillation, are discussed. The results of ab-initio simulations of n-rich,
n-poor, heavy ion collisions, using stochastic isospin dependent transport
equations, are analysed as a function of beam energy and centrality. The
isospin dynamics plays an important role in all steps of the reaction, from
prompt nucleon emissions to the final fragments. The isospin diffusion is also
of large interest, due to the interplay of asymmetry and density gradients. In
relativistic collisions, the possibility of a direct study of the covariant
structure of the effective nucleon interaction is shown. Results are discussed
for particle production, collective flows and iso-transparency.

function, which is a generalization of the Van Hove single-particle correlation
function, is introduced to calculate the resonant-formation rate in such
targets. This function is derived in the case of a polycrystalline harmonic
solid. Also is found a general asymptotic form of the resonance correlation
function for high momentum transfers, valid for any solid or dense-fluid

profiles are affected by large zero-point vibrations of the hydrogen-isotope

Doppler spectral line shapes in magnetized plasmas. Low frequency refers here
to fluctuations whose typical time scale is much larger than those
characterizing the atomic processes, such as radiative decay, collisions and
charge exchange. This ordering is in particular relevant for drift wave
turbulence, ubiquitous in edge plasmas of fusion devices. Turbulent
fluctuations are found to affect line shapes through both the spatial and time
averages introduced by the measurement process. The profile is expressed in
terms of the fluid fields describing the plasma. Assuming the spectrometer
acquisition time to be much larger than the turbulent time scale, an ordering
generally fulfilled in experiments, allows to develop a statistical formalism.
We proceed by investigating the effects of density, fluid velocity and
temperature fluctuations alone on the Doppler profile of a spectral line
emitted by a charge exchange population of neutrals. Line wings are found to be
affected by ion temperature or fluid velocity fluctuations, and can in some
cases exhibit a power-law behavior. This study gives some insights in the

genomes of higher eukaryotes (the ``junk'' DNA) codes for a vast, RNA-based,
genetic regulatory network. It is believed that this network is responsible for
the variety and complexity of terrestrial life. We conjecture that this
regulatory network is more properly viewed as an RNA ``community'', composed of
a rich and largely unexplored biochemical web of RNA interactions. Viewed as an
RNA-community, we hypothesize that the RNA regulatory network of higher
eukaryotes can re-wire itself, and employ various and evolvable mutational
strategies in response to external pressures. Thus, we argue that much
evolutionary change is due to intracellular, RNA-mediated learning processes.
Successful strategies and pathways are then recorded (hard-wired) into the DNA
genome via reverse transcriptase. We present evidence which is consistent with
this viewpoint, and make specific predictions which could be used to test the
utility of our framework. If essentially correct, the RNA-community view of
eukaryotic cells could reconcile measured point mutation and gene duplication
rates with actual rates of evolutionary change. Futhermore, the RNA-community
view of eukaryotic cells suggests that agent-based modeling techniques, used in
mathematical economics, game theory, and neuroscience, will likely be as useful
in understanding the functioning of eukaryotic cells as the pathway-based
approaches of systems biology. We conclude this paper by arguing that a
sufficient amount of biological knowledge has been accumulated to initiate a
systematic program of experimental and computational studies of the origins and
macroevolution of terrestrial life.

can predict the outcome of these competitions as a function of the mutation
rate and the time scale of the environmental changes. Our model is relevant for
arboviruses, which alternate between different host species on a regular basis.

  only",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  Much has been debated about the benefit of sexual over asexual reproduction
in terms of evolutionary fitness. Here we focus on the advantage that may be
brought about by the process of mating, where the choosing of mates contributes
to the increase in fitness in a constructive way. We carry out computer
simulations of such mating systems and investigate, on one hand, how mate
phenotypes contribute to offspring fitness, and, on the other hand, how
selection affects mate phenotypes. We discuss how helpful such a mechanism may
be in determining trajectories on rugged energy landscapes leading to global
optimum.

space distribution functions of quantum systems. Wigner and Husimi functions
are considered. Different quantum algorithms are envisioned to build these
functions, and compared with the classical computation. Different procedures to
extract more efficiently information from the final wave function of these
algorithms are studied, including coarse-grained measurements, amplitude
amplification and measure of wavelet-transformed wave function. The algorithms
are analyzed and numerically tested on a complex quantum system showing
different behavior depending on parameters, namely the kicked rotator. The
results for the Wigner function show in particular that the use of the quantum
wavelet transform gives a polynomial gain over classical computation. For the
Husimi distribution, the gain is much larger than for the Wigner function, and
is bigger with the help of amplitude amplification and wavelet transforms. We
also apply the same set of techniques to the analysis of real images. The
results show that the use of the quantum wavelet transform allows to lower
dramatically the number of measurements needed, but at the cost of a large loss
of information.

both the forward and backward directions.
  Each communication capacity can be thought of as a tradeoff between the
achievable rates of specific types of forward and backward communication.
  Our first result shows that for any bipartite unitary gate, coherent
classical communication is no more difficult than classical communication --
they have the same achievable rate regions. Previously this result was known
only for the unidirectional capacities (i.e., the boundaries of the tradeoff).
  We then relate the tradeoff curve for two-way coherent communication to the
tradeoff for two-way quantum communication and the tradeoff for coherent
communiation in one direction and quantum communication in the other.

situations when measurement statistics is insufficient to determine consistent

channel (i.e., the corresponding map is not completely positive). We present a
regularization procedure that allows us to derive physically reasonable
estimates (approximations) of quantum channels. We illustrate our procedure on
specific examples and we show that the procedure can be also used for a
derivation of optimal approximations of operations that are forbidden by the
laws of quantum mechanics (e.g., the universal NOT gate).

proposed recently. In contrast to previous calculations of channeling radiation
in crystals, our calculation takes into account the interference between
different transition amplitudes. The development stemmed from the idea that the
amplitude for a given process is the sum of the transition amplitudes for each
transition to lower state of transverse energy with the same energy differences
between bound-bound transitions. It seems that a consistent interpretation is
only possible if positrons move in a nearly harmonic planar potential with
equidistant energy levels.
