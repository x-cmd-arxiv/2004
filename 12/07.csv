investigate millisecond aperiodic X-ray variability of Cyg X-1 is presented.
This relatively new approach in a time-series analysis allows us to study both
the significance of any flux oscillations localized in time-frequency space, as
well as the stability of its period. Using the observations of the RXTE/PCA we
analyze archival data from Cyg X-1 during its failed state transition. The
power spectrum of such a state is strongly dominated by a single Lorentzian
peak corresponding to a damped oscillator. Our wavelet analysis presented in
this paper shows the existence of short lasting oscillations without an obvious
trend in the frequency domain. Based on this result, we suggest the
interpretation of the dominant components of Cyg X-1 power spectrum in all
spectral states: (i) a power law component dominating a soft state is due to
accretion rate fluctuations related to MRI instability in the cold disk, (ii)
the low frequency Lorentzian is related to the same fluctuations but in the
inner ion torus, and (iii) the high frequency Lorentzian (dominating the power
spectrum during the failed state transition) is due to the dynamical pulsations
of the inner ion torus.
  The usage of the wavelet analysis as a potential and attractive tool in order
to spot the semi-direct evidences of accretion process onto black-holes is
proposed.

we attribute to variations in its absorbing column depth, and eclipses with a
probable 3.087 hour period. For most of our exposures, W37's blackbody-like

fit by a power-law of photon index ~1.6-3. An additional soft component is
required for both W17 and X4, which can be fit with a 10 km hydrogen-atmosphere
neutron star model. X4 shows significant variability, which may arise from
either its power-law or hydrogen-atmosphere spectral component. Both W17 and X4
show rather low X-ray luminosities, Lx(0.5-10 keV)~5*10^{31} ergs/s. All three

may be of similar numbers as the group of previously identified objects. The

  A philosophy is also presented on how to use color and composition to create

appealing. This philosophy is necessary because most datasets do not correspond
to the wavelength range of sensitivity of the human eye. The use of visual
grammar, defined as the elements which affect the interpretation of an image,
can maximize the richness and detail in an image while maintaining scientific
accuracy. By properly using visual grammar, one can imply qualities that a
two-dimensional image intrinsically cannot show, such as depth, motion and
energy. In addition, composition can be used to engage viewers and keep them
interested for a longer period of time. The use of these techniques can result
in a striking image that will effectively convey the science within the image,

stable, extremely low-luminosity (~10^{-9} L_Edd), thermal quiescent state,
which is interrupted roughly daily by a brief, nonthermal X-ray flare. Because
they are not accompanied by significant changes in the radio wavelengths, the
flares make Sgr A* unusual in the context of black holes accreting at slightly
higher rates. Those sources display a radio/X-ray luminosity correlation whose
normalization scales with central mass, and that holds over orders of magnitude
in accretion power. There is significant scatter in this correlation, due in
part to measurement uncertainties and intrinsic variability. By studying the
correlation in sources bracketing Sgr A* in radio luminosity and whose physical
parameters are well measured, we can derive a statistical measure of this local
scatter. We find that Sgr A* in quiescence and the lower intensity flares fall
well below the correlation in X-ray luminosity. The brightest flares are
consistent within the scatter, which may indicate an upper bound on the X-ray
luminosity. This trend is suggestive of a state transition at the extreme low
end of accretion activity, only above which the radio/X-ray correlation is
tracked. This scenario is easily testable because it must fulfill three unique
observational predictions: 1) As long as Sgr A* remains at its current radio
luminosity, no X-ray flare will be seen which statistically exceeds the
prediction of the correlation, 2) no source already on the correlation will be
seen to flare in the X-rays similar to Sgr A* (i.e., without corresponding
increases in the radio luminosity), and 3) sources below a critical accretion
rate or luminosity will show similar flares as Sgr A*, on timescales
appropriate to their masses.

Local luminosity enhancements, which preferentially occur over regions of
strong magnetic field, lead to a net global asymmetry in the neutrino emission
and the young neutron star is propelled in the direction opposite to these
regions. For favorable values of magnetic field structure, size, and strength
as well as neutrino bubble saturation amplitude, momentum kicks in excess of
1000 km/s can be achieved. Since the neutrino-powered kick is delivered over
the duration of the Kelvin-Helmholtz time ~ a few seconds, one expects
spin-kick alignment from this neutrino bubble powered model.

eccentricity vs. orbital period (e-log(P)) displays a distinct transition from

is due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of
binary orbits in M35 provide a significantly improved constraint on the rate of
tidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust
diagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based
on a functional fit to the e-log(P) distribution. We call this new measure the
tidal circularization period. The tidal circularization period of a binary
population represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most
frequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (defined as e = 0.01) at the
age of the population. We determine the tidal circularizationperiod for M35 as
well as for 7 additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre
main-sequence (~ 3 Myr) to late main-sequence (~ 10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo

Each quasar has been monitored typically for 2 - 4 hours with a time resolution

the significant redshift (z>2), the covered wavelength range falls into the UV

and UV line and X-ray continuum fluxes modulate regularly over the
magnetic/rotational period. A flattened magnetosphere surrounding co-rotates
with these stars, producing a periodic modulation of emission and absorption
components of the UV resonance lines, as well as of optical H and He lines. In
this paper we examine these modulations in detail and point out that the
far-blue and near-red wings of C IV and N V resonance lines exhibit
anticorrelated modulations, causing mild flux elevations at moderate redshifts
at edge-on phase (phi=0.5). However, the lines do not exhibit rest-frame
absorption features, the usual signatures of cool static disks surrounding Bp
stars. We suggest that this behavior can be explained by the existence of two
geometrically distinct wind regions separated by the local magnetic Alfven
radius. Wind streams emerging outside this point are forced outward by
radiative forces and eventually expand outward radially to infinity - this
matter produces the far-blue wing absorptions at phi=0.5. Interior streams
follow closed loops and collide at the magnetic equator with counterstreams.
There they coalesce and fall back to the star along their original field lines
- these are responsible for mild emissions at this same phase. The rapid
circulation of the interior wind component back to the star is responsible for
the absence of static disk features.

of long-period pulsars are known to exhibit mode changes that give rise to very
large deviations in their integrated profiles, this was the first millisecond
pulsar thought to have an unstable mean profile. As part of a precision timing
program at the Parkes radio telescope we observed this pulsar between January
2003 and March 2004 using a coherent de-dispersion system (CPSR2). A study of
morphological variability during our brightest observations suggests that the
pulse profile varies by at most a few percent, similar to the uncertainty in
our calibration. Unlike previous authors, we find that this pulsar times
extremely well. In five minute integrations of 64 MHz bands we obtain a
weighted RMS residual of just 2.27 microseconds. The reduced chi-squared of our
best fit is 1.43, which suggests that this pulsar can be timed to high accuracy
with standard cross-correlation techniques. Combining relativistic constraints
with the pulsar mass function and consideration of the Chandrasekhar mass limit
on the white dwarf companion, we can constrain the inclination angle of the
system to lie within the range 37 < i < 56 degrees. For reasonable pulsar
masses, this suggests that the white dwarf is at least 0.9 solar masses. We
also find evidence for secular evolution of the projected semi-major axis.

absence of extraneous perturbations, \xi decreases until the spin-up

of the impossibility to resolve the flame structure under the assumption of
spherical symmetry. Spherically symmetric models have been successful in
explaining many of the observational features of Type Ia supernovae, but they
rely on two kinds of empirical models: one that describes the behaviour of the
flame on the scales unresolved by the code, and another that takes account of
the evolution of the flame shape. In contrast, three-dimensional simulations
are able to compute the flame shape in a self-consistent way, but they still
need a model for the propagation of the flame in the scales unresolved by the
code. Furthermore, in three dimensions the number of degrees of freedom of the
initial configuration of the white dwarf at runaway is much larger than in one
dimension. Recent simulations have shown that the sensitivity of the explosion
output to the initial conditions can be extremely large. New paradigms of
thermonuclear supernovae have emerged from this situation, as the Pulsating
Reverse Detonation. The resolution of all these issues must rely on the
predictions of observational properties of the models, and their comparison
with current Type Ia supernova data, including X-ray spectra of Type Ia

theoretical stellar population synthesis techniques, we find that using actual
determinations of SFR and AMR of the LMC and SMC, their RGB is populated by
stars much younger (by 9 Gyr) than the Galactic globular cluster counterparts,
on which the I-band (and K-band) TRGB absolute magnitude is calibrated. This
age difference induces a bias in both the photometric metallicity estimates
based on the comparison of RGB colours with globular cluster ones, and the TRGB
distances. The extent of the distance bias is strongly dependent on the
specific TRGB technique applied, and on the assumed I-band BC scale adopted;
the correction to apply to the SMC-LMC distance modulus ranges from 0 up to
+0.10 mag. LGS3 is an example of galaxy populated mainly by old stars, so that
photometric metallicity and distance estimates using globular cluster
calibrations are reliable. However, the relative distance moduli between
Magellanic Clouds and LGS3 are affected by the population effects discussed for
the LMC and SMC. The corrections to apply to the K-band TRGB distances are
larger than the I-band case. Our results clearly show that the presence of a
well developed RGB in the CMD of a stellar system with a complex SFR does not
guarantee that it is populated by globular cluster-like red giants, and

solubility limit of 0.14at% Au in Hg had previously been shown to exhibit a
unique surface phase characterized by a low-density surface region with a
complicated temperature dependence. In this paper we present reflectivity
measurements near the Au LIII edge, for 0.2at% Au in Hg at room temperature.
The data are consistent with a concentration of Au in the surface region that
can be no larger than about 30at%. These results rule out previous suggestions
that pure Au layers segregate at the alloy surface.

several models of glasses: elasto-plastic deformations, mode-coupling theory
(MCT), collectively rearranging regions (CRR), diffusing defects and
kinetically constrained models (KCM). Some features of the four-point
susceptibility chi_4(t) are expected to be universal. at short times we expect
an elastic regime characterized by a t or sqrt{t} growth. We find both in the
beta, and the early alpha regime that chi_4 sim t^mu, where mu is directly
related to the mechanism responsible for relaxation. This regime ends when a
maximum of chi_4 is reached at a time t=t^* of the order of the relaxation time
of the system. This maximum is followed by a fast decay to zero at large times.
The height of the maximum also follows a power-law, chi_4(t^*) sim t^{*lambda}.
The value of the exponents mu and lambda allows one to distinguish between
different mechanisms. For example, freely diffusing defects in d=3 lead to mu=2
and lambda=1, whereas the CRR scenario rather predicts either mu=1 or a
logarithmic behaviour depending on the nature of the nucleation events, and a
logarithmic behaviour of chi_4(t^*). MCT leads to mu=b and lambda =1/gamma,
where b and gamma are the standard MCT exponents. We compare our theoretical
results with numerical simulations on a Lennard-Jones and a soft-sphere system.
Within the limited time-scales accessible to numerical simulations, we find
that the exponent mu is rather small, mu < 1, with a value in reasonable
agreement with the MCT predictions.

liquid-liquid phase transition in isotropic systems, such as biological
solutions and colloids, whose interaction can be represented via an effective
potential with a repulsive soft-core and an attractive part. We investigate how
the phase diagram of a schematic general isotropic system, interacting via a
soft-core squared attractive potential, changes by varying the parameters of
the potential. It has been shown that this potential has a phase diagram with a
liquid-liquid phase transition in addition to the standard gas-liquid phase
transition and that, for a short-range soft-core, the phase diagram resulting
from molecular dynamics simulations can be interpreted through a modified van
der Waals equation. Here we consider the case of soft-core ranges comparable
with or larger than the hard-core diameter. Because an analysis using molecular
dynamics simulations of such systems or potentials is too time-demanding, we
adopt an integral equation approach in the hypernetted-chain approximation.
Thus we can estimate how the temperature and density of both critical points
depend on the potential's parameters for large soft-core ranges. The present
results confirm and extend our previous analysis, showing that this potential
has two fluid-fluid critical points that are well separated in temperature and
in density only if there is a balance between the attractive and repulsive part
of the potential. We find that for large soft-core ranges our results satisfy a
simple relation between the potential's parameters.

sizes. Starting from pure monomers, three eras of transient nucleation are
characterized in the classic Becker-D\""oring kinetic equations with two
different models of discrete diffusivity: the classic Turnbull-Fisher formula
and an expression describing thermally driven growth of the nucleus. The latter
diffusivity yields time lags for nucleation which are much closer to values
measured in experiments with disilicate glasses. After an initial stage in
which the number of monomers decreases, many clusters of small size are
produced and a continuous size distribution is created. During the second era,
nucleii are increasing steadily in size in such a way that their distribution
appears as a wave front advancing towards the critical size for steady
nucleation. The nucleation rate at critical size is negligible during this era.
After the wave front reaches critical size, it ignites the creation of
supercritical clusters at a rate that increases monotonically until its steady
value is reached. Analytical formulas for the transient nucleation rate and the
time lag are obtained that improve classical ones and compare very well with
direct numerical solutions.

measuring relational similarity. LRA has potential applications in many areas,
including information extraction, word sense disambiguation, machine
translation, and information retrieval. Relational similarity is correspondence
between relations, in contrast with attributional similarity, which is
correspondence between attributes. When two words have a high degree of
attributional similarity, we call them synonyms. When two pairs of words have a
high degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are
analogous. For example, the word pair mason/stone is analogous to the pair
carpenter/wood. Past work on semantic similarity measures has mainly been
concerned with attributional similarity. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM)
of information retrieval has been adapted to the task of measuring relational
similarity, achieving a score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level
multiple-choice word analogy questions. In the VSM approach, the relation
between a pair of words is characterized by a vector of frequencies of
predefined patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three
ways: (1) the patterns are derived automatically from the corpus (they are not
predefined), (2) the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the
frequency data (it is also used this way in Latent Semantic Analysis), and (3)
automatically generated synonyms are used to explore reformulations of the word
pairs. LRA achieves 56% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent
to the average human score of 57%. On the related problem of classifying
noun-modifier relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM, while using a

"gr-qc/0412027","J. Ponce de Leon","J. Ponce de Leon","Testing Dark Energy and Cardassian Expansion for Causality",,,,,"gr-qc",,"  Causality principle is a powerful criterion that allows us to discriminate
between what is possible or not. In this paper we study the transition from
decelerated to accelerated expansion in the context of Cardassian and dark
energy models. We distinguish two important events during the transition. The
first one is the end of the matter-dominated phase, which occurs at some time
$t_{eq}$. The second one is the actual crossover from deceleration to
acceleration, which occurs at some $t_{T}$. Causality requires $t_{T} \geq
t_{eq}$. We demonstrate that dark energy models, with constant $w$, and
Cardassian expansion, are compatible with causality only if $(\Omega_{M} -
\bar{q}) \leq 1/2$. However, observational data indicate that the most probable
option is $(\Omega_{M} - \bar{q}) > 1/2$. Consequently, the transition from
deceleration to acceleration in dark energy and Cardassian models occurs before
the matter-dominated epoch comes to an end, i.e., $t_{eq} > t_{T}$. Which
contradicts causality principle.

large-size 4Q configurations, respectively. Here, the calculation for
large-size 4Q configurations is done by identifying $16^2 \times 32$ as the

infrared screening of the long-range color forces between (anti)quarks

second kind of a poset, recently discovered by Hetyei. The Tchebyshev transform
(of the first kind) preserves desirable combinatorial properties, including
Eulerianess (due to Hetyei) and EL-shellability. It is also a linear
transformation on flag vectors. When restricted to Eulerian posets, it
corresponds to the Billera, Ehrenborg and Readdy omega map of oriented
matroids. One consequence is that nonnegativity of the cd-index is maintained.
  The Tchebyshev transform of the second kind is a Hopf algebra endomorphism on
the space of quasisymmetric functions QSym. It coincides with Stembridge's peak
enumerator for Eulerian posets, but differs for general posets. The complete
spectrum is determined, generalizing work of Billera, Hsiao and van
Willigenburg.
  The type B quasisymmetric function of a poset is introduced. Like Ehrenborg's
classical quasisymmetric function of a poset, this map is a comodule morphism
with respect to the quasisymmetric functions QSym.
  Similarities among the omega map, Ehrenborg's r-signed Birkhoff transform,
and the Tchebyshev transforms motivate a general study of chain maps. One such
occurrence, the chain map of the second kind, is a Hopf algebra endomorphism on
the quasisymmetric functions QSym and is an instance of Aguiar, Bergeron and
Sottile's result on the terminal object in the category of combinatorial Hopf
algebras. In contrast, the chain map of the first kind is both an algebra map
and a comodule endomorphism on the type B quasisymmetric functions BQSym.

final-state interactions often lead to significant effects on the reaction
cross sections. For Coulomb-type interactions, the Gamow factor has been
traditionally used to take into account these effects. However the Gamow factor
needs to be modified when the magnitude of the coupling constant or the
relative velocity of two particles increases. We obtain the relativistic
generalization of the Gamow factor in terms of the overlap of the Feynman
amplitude with the relativistic wave function of two fermions with an
attractive Coulomb-type interaction. An explicit form of the corrective factor
is presented for the spin-singlet S-wave state. While the corrective factor
approaches the Gamow factor in the non-relativistic limit, we found that the
Gamow factor significantly over-estimates the effects when the coupling
constant or the velocity is large.

discussion of the present status of the CERN experiments on hadron collective

1 to 50 A$\cdot$GeV: here the hydrodynamic model has predicted the collapse of
the $v_1$-flow and of the $v_2$-flow at $\sim 10$ A$\cdot$GeV; at 40
A$\cdot$GeV it has been recently observed by the NA49 collaboration. Since
hadronic rescattering models predict much larger flow than observed at this
energy we interpret this observation as evidence for a first order phase
transition at high baryon density $\rho_B$. Moreover, the connection of the
elliptic flow $v_2$ to jet suppression is examined. It is proven experimentally
that the collective flow is not faked by minijet fragmentation. Additionally,
detailed transport studies show that the away-side jet suppression can only
partially ($<$ 50%) be due to hadronic rescattering. Furthermore, the change in
sign of $v_1, v_2$ closer to beam rapidity is related to the occurence of a
high density first order phase transition in the RHIC data at 62.5, 130 and 200

relativistic effects which emerge from Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity,
which is based upon the concept of a flat spacetime ontology, and which then
lead to the General Theory of Relativity with its curved spacetime model for
gravity. While the relativistic effects are well established experimentally it
is now known that numerous experiments, beginning with the Michelson-Morley
experiment of 1887, have always shown that the postulates themselves are false,
namely that there is a detectable local preferred frame of reference. This
critique briefly reviews the experimental evidence regarding the failure of the
postulates, and the implications for our understanding of fundamental physics,
and in particular for our understanding of gravity. A new theory of gravity is
seen to be necessary, and this results in an explanation of the `dark matter'
effect entailing the discovery that the fine structure constant is a 2nd
