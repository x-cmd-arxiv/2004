Lyman alpha emission escapes from the interstellar medium in the starburst
galaxy Mkn 357. An H-alpha image shows that the ionized gas is mostly in a
global wind, rather than associated with the individual star-forming regions
seen in the optical and UV continuum. The Lyman alpha emission comes
predominantly from the northwest side of the wind structure spatially, and
shows a significant redshift relative to the optical lines. Both of these
properties are signatures of seeing the line photons backscattered from the far
side of a prolate or bipolar starburst wind, fitting both with escape
calculations and evidence for winds in high-redshift galaxies with net Lyman
alpha emission. Scattering is most important within this wind itself, rather
than involving a surrounding neutral medium, as shown by the decreasing
relative redshift of the line peak from 250 to 30 km/s between the center and
edge of the detected emission. The Lyman alpha emission exhibits strong
asymmetry in comparison with both the starlight and H-alpha structures. These
results add to the evidence that kinematics, rather than gas metallicity or
dust content, are the dominant effect in determining which galaxies have strong
Lyman alpha emission, and that powerful (and perhaps episodic) starbursts are
common among Lyman-break galaxies as well as those discovered from Lyman alpha
line emission.

shape as a function of redshift, confirming earlier reports of
luminosity--dependent density evolution. The space density with redshift
changes significantly for different luminosity classes, showing a strong
positive evolution up to a certain redshift and then a flattening. The
redshift, at which the evolution peaks, changes considerably with X-ray

strong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surface
brightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''

diagnostics of the geometry and kinematics of the ``Little Homunculus'' (LH)
growing inside the larger Homunculus nebula. The LH expansion is not perfectly
homologous: while low-latitudes are consistent with linear expansion since
1910, the polar caps imply ejection dates around 1920--1930. However, the
expansion speed of the LH is slower than the post-eruption wind, so the star's
powerful wind may accelerate it. With an initial ejection speed of 200 km/s in
1890, the LH would have been accelerated to its present speed if the mass is
roughly 0.1 Msun. This agrees with an independent estimate of the LH mass based
on its density and volume. In any case, an ejection after 1930 is ruled out.
Using the LH as a probe of the 1890 event, then, it is evident that its most
basic physical parameters (total mass and kinetic energy; 0.1 Msun and 10^46.9
ergs, respectively) are orders of magnitude less than during the giant eruption
in the 1840s. Thus, the ultimate energy sources were different for these two
events -- yet their ejecta have the same bipolar geometry. This clue may point
toward a collimation mechanism separate from the underlying causes of the
outbursts.

  The Hubble flow is significant colder around LGs selected in a flat, Lambda

dark energy component manifests itself on the scales of nearby galaxies,
cooling galaxy peculiar motions. Flows in the LWDM and QCDM models are
marginally colder than in the LCDM one.
  The results of our simulations have been compared to existing data and a new
data set of 28 nearby galaxies with robust distance measures (Cepheids and
Surface Brightness Fluctuations). The measured line-of-sight velocity
dispersion is sigma = 88 +- 20 km/sec x (R/7 Mpc). The best agreement with
observations is found for LGs selected in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in

with existing observational estimates on the local matter density.
  These results provide new, independent evidence for the presence of dark

appear steady in a uniformly rotating frame. Such a flow might correspond to a
stellar pulsation mode or an accretion disk with a free global distortion
giving it finite eccentricity. We consider perturbations arbitrarily localized
in the neighbourhood of unperturbed fluid streamlines.When conditions do not
vary around them, perturbations take the form of oscillatory inertial or
gravity modes. However, when conditions do vary so that a circulating fluid
element is subject to periodic variations, parametric instability may occur.
For nearly circular streamlines, the dense spectra associated with inertial or
gravity modes ensure that resonance conditions can always be satisfied when
twice the period of circulation round a streamline falls within. We apply our
formalism to a differentially rotating disk for which the streamlines are
Keplerian ellipses, with free eccentricity up to 0.7, which do not precess in
an inertial frame. We show that for small $e,$ the instability involves
parametric excitation of two modes with azimuthal mode number differing by
unity in magnitude which have a period of twice the period of variation as
viewed from a circulating unperturbed fluid element. Instability persists over
a widening range of wave numbers with increasing growth rates for larger
eccentricities. The nonlinear outcome is studied in a follow up paper which
indicates development of small scale subsonic turbulence.

evidence of a late X-ray burst, taking place several minutes after the prompt

it represents the onset of the afterglow. Broad band spectral modelling of the
afterglow indicate that the fireball evolution in the December burst takes
place in a ISM environment. On the contrary in the November burst the wind case
is revealed by an X-ray decay slower than that observed in the optical
($\delta_{\rm X}=1.29\pm0.04$ vs $\delta_{\rm O}=1.66\pm0.06$). The wind
profile should change into a constant density profile at large radii, in order
to reconcile late-time radio data with a jet. Two other results are obtained
for this burst. An X-ray burst is preceding by about 30 s the much harder GRB.
Contrary to the prediction of simple models of precursor activity for
collapsars, its spectrum is not consistent with a black body. Finally, a
substantial absorption column ($\NH=(7\pm2)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) is
detected during the early part of the prompt emission. This is much greater
than that of the wind, and it is thus likely associated with the region
surrounding the burst.

chain and its dual reaction-diffusion model, for arbitrary initial conditions.
The spin chain is driven out of equilibrium by coupling alternating spins to
two thermal baths at different temperatures. In the reaction-diffusion model,
this translates into spatially alternating rates for particle creation and
annihilation, and even negative ``temperatures'' have a perfectly natural
interpretation. Observables of interest include the magnetization, the particle
density, and all correlation functions for both models. Two generic types of
time-dependence are found: if both temperatures are positive, the
magnetization, density and correlation functions decay exponentially to their
steady-state values. In contrast, if one of the temperatures is negative,
damped oscillations are observed in all quantities. They can be traced to a
subtle competition of pair creation and annihilation on the two sublattices. We
comment on the limitations of mean-field theory and propose an experimental
realization of our model in certain conjugated polymers and linear chain
compounds.

sodium cations among the CoO2 layers are a key factor for the presence of
complex structural properties in NaxCoO2 materials, and also demonstrate that

vortex solid in ferromagnetic superconductors. Using a rigorous thermodynamic
argument, we show that in the idealized case of vanishing crystalline pinning
anisotropy the long-wavelength tilt modulus of such a vortex solid vanishes
identically, as guaranteed by the underlying rotational invariance. The
vanishing of the tilt modulus means that, to lowest order, the associated
tension elasticity is replaced by the softer, curvature elasticity. The effect
of this is to make the spontaneous vortex solid qualitatively more susceptible
to the disordering effects of thermal fluctuations and random pinning. We study
these effects, taking into account the nonlinear elasticity, that, in three
dimensions, is important at sufficiently long length scales, and showing that a
``columnar elastic glass'' phase of vortices results. This phase is controlled
by a previously unstudied zero-temperature fixed point and it is characterized
by elastic moduli that have universal strong wave-vector dependence out to
arbitrarily long length scales, leading to non-Hookean elasticity. We argue
that, although translationally disordered for weak disorder, the columnar
elastic glass is stable against the proliferation of dislocations and is
therefore a topologically ordered {\em elastic} glass. As a result, the
phenomenology of the spontaneous vortex state of isotropic magnetic
superconductors differs qualitatively from a conventional,
external-field-induced mixed state. For example, for weak external fields $H$,
the magnetic induction scales {\em universally} like $B(H)\sim B(0)+ c

which molecules need to surmount local potential barriers, while the

thus altering the potential). Recent experimental findings have shown that both
thermal energy and density contribute significantly to the
temperature-dependence of vitrifying liquids. Herein, we show that the scaling
(superpositioning) of the relaxation times near the glassy state, by expressing
them as a function of temperature and the specific volume, leads to a
modification of the usual fragility curves, whereby differences in the extent
of departure from Arrhenius behavior can be rationalized. More intriguingly,
the characteristic changes in the relaxation properties (i.e., the 'dynamic

of the metal-insulator phase boundary drawn in the plane of the chemical
potential and the Coulomb interaction in the phase diagram of the Hubbard
model. The relations impose constraints on the critical properties of the Mott
transition. These thermodynamic relations are indeed confirmed to be satisfied
in the cases of the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models. One of these
relations yields that at the continuous Mott transition with a diverging charge
compressibility, the doublon susceptibility also diverges. The constraints on
the shapes of the phase boundary containing a first-order metal-insulator
transition at finite temperatures are clarified based on the thermodynamic
relations. For example, the first-order phase boundary is parallel to the
temperature axis asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. The
applicability of the thermodynamic relations are not restricted only to the

perturbation theory of degenerate levels in the coupling strength v and by

via a two-step process of rapid and slow expansions, which persist for any v>0.
An elementary analysis of the degenerate perturbation expansion reveals that
non-localized states may appear only in a sufficiently high order of
perturbation theory, which is simply related to the combinatorial properties of
the sequences. Numerical diagonalization furthermore shows that eigenstates
ergodically spread across the entire chain for v>0, while in the limit as v->0
ergodicity is broken and eigenstates spread only across clusters of the same
type, in contradistinction with trivial localization at v=0. An investigation

that, by changing the position or strength of such an impurity, it is possible
to control the long-time wave-packet dynamics. By adding a single impurity it

structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated here via a deterministic simulation

The system thus relaxes to disequilibrium, with very different densities of the
permeable species on each side of the membrane. A single species of

their relative semantics to other words and phrases. For computers the
equivalent of `society' is `database,' and the equivalent of `use' is `way to

phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix
thoughts we use the world-wide-web as database, and Google as search engine.
The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This
theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract
similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the
world-wide-web using Google page counts. The world-wide-web is the largest
database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of
independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful
quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and
language translation. We give examples to distinguish between colors and
numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of
books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies, and primes,
and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic English-Spanish
translation. Finally, we use the WordNet database as an objective baseline
against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive
randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to
learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement
of 87% with the expert crafted WordNet categories.

  Satisfiability","A short version of this report has appeared at the First
  International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning, IJCAR 2001",,,,"cs.LO",,"  Tableaux-based decision procedures for satisfiability of modal and
description logics behave quite well in practice, but it is sometimes hard to
obtain exact worst-case complexity results using these approaches, especially
for EXPTIME-complete logics. In contrast, automata-based approaches often yield
algorithms for which optimal worst-case complexity can easily be proved.
However, the algorithms obtained this way are usually not only worst-case, but
also best-case exponential: they first construct an automaton that is always
exponential in the size of the input, and then apply the (polynomial) emptiness
test to this large automaton. To overcome this problem, one must try to
construct the automaton ""on-the-fly"" while performing the emptiness test.
  In this paper we will show that Voronkov's inverse method for the modal logic
K can be seen as an on-the-fly realization of the emptiness test done by the
automata approach for K. The benefits of this result are two-fold. First, it
shows that Voronkov's implementation of the inverse method, which behaves quite
well in practice, is an optimized on-the-fly implementation of the
automata-based satisfiability procedure for K. Second, it can be used to give a
simpler proof of the fact that Voronkov's optimizations do not destroy
completeness of the procedure. We will also show that the inverse method can
easily be extended to handle global axioms, and that the correspondence to the
automata approach still holds in this setting. In particular, the inverse
method yields an EXPTIME-algorithm for satisfiability in K w.r.t. global
axioms.

one can give a simple geometric description of this gravitational response.
This is calculated in detail for the example of a closed Feynman loop in the

develops stronger elliptic flow during the late stages of the fireball

theories, as well as Euclidean quantum gravity, at one-loop level on manifolds

h can be chosen to be completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms,
to preserve the invariance group of the theory and BRST symmetry. In the de
Donder gauge, however, the resulting boundary-value problem for the Laplace
type operator acting on h is known to be self-adjoint but not strongly
elliptic. The latter is a technical condition ensuring that a unique smooth
solution of the boundary-value problem exists, which implies, in turn, that the
global heat-kernel asymptotics yielding one-loop divergences and one-loop
effective action actually exists. The present paper shows that, on the
Euclidean four-ball, only the scalar part of perturbative modes for quantum
gravity are affected by the lack of strong ellipticity. Further evidence for
lack of strong ellipticity, from an analytic point of view, is therefore
obtained. Interestingly, three sectors of the scalar-perturbation problem
remain elliptic, while lack of strong ellipticity is confined to the remaining
fourth sector. The integral representation of the resulting zeta-function
asymptotics is also obtained; this remains regular at the origin by virtue of a
spectral identity here obtained for the first time.

curvature membranes in constant curvature AdS and dS background and consider
their general intersections. This illustrates some key features which make the
theory different to the Einstein gravity. Higher co-dimension membranes may lie
at the intersection of co-dimension 1 hypersurfaces in Lovelock gravity; the
hypersurfaces are located at the discontinuities of the first derivative of the

  The example of colliding membranes shows that general solutions can only be
supported by (spacelike) matter at the collision surface, thus naturally
conflicting with the dominant energy condition (DEC). The imposition of the DEC
gives selection rules on the types of collision allowed.
  When the hypersurfaces don't carry matter, one gets a soliton-like
configuration. Then, at the intersection one has a co-dimension 2 or higher
membrane standing alone in AdS-vacuum spacetime \emph{without conical

math-ph/0412074 and math-ph/0412075. After reviewing the conformal spacetime
structure, conformal maps are described in Minkowski spacetime as the twisted
adjoint representation of the group Spin_+(2,4), acting on paravectors.
Twistors are then presented via the paravector model of Clifford algebras and
related to conformal maps in the Clifford algebra over the lorentzian R{4,1}$
spacetime. We construct twistors in Minkowski spacetime as algebraic spinors
associated with the Dirac-Clifford algebra Cl(1,3)(C) using one lower spacetime
dimension than standard Clifford algebra formulations, since for this purpose
the Clifford algebra over R{4,1} is also used to describe conformal maps,
instead of R{2,4}. Although some papers have already described twistors using
the algebra Cl(1,3)(C), isomorphic to Cl(4,1), the present formulation sheds
some new light on the use of the paravector model and generalizations.

(e.g. a product Bernoulli measure or a high temperature Gibbs measure).
Exploiting recent progresses in the analysis of the mixing time of Monte Carlo

tackle the above problem for the Ising and hard core gas (independent sets)

stretched exponential of the time $t$. In the context of randomized algorithms
and if one considers the Glauber dynamics on a large, finite tree, our results
prove fast local relaxation to equilibrium on time scales much smaller than the

determines the final distribution of population. Our demonstration consists of
three steps: We first show the existence of limit from a typical physical
sciences setting: the potential is a type of Mexican hat type, with the
strength of a magnetic field scale with the strength the potential gradient
near the limit cycle, and the friction goes to zero faster than the potential
near the limit cycle. Hence the dynamics at the limit cycle is conserved. The
diffusion matrix is nevertheless finite at the limit cycle. Secondly, we
construct the potential in the dynamics with limit cycle in a typical dynamical
systems setting. Thirdly, we argue that such a construction can be carried out
in a more general situation based on a method discovered by one of us. This
method of dealing with stochastic differential equation is in general different
from both Ito and Stratonovich calculus. Our result may be useful in many
related applications, such as in the discussion of metastability of limit cycle

developed an EDXS quantification method based on the ratio method and taking
into account local absorption corrections. In this way, we use EELS data to
determine, by an iterative process, the local mass thickness which is an
essential parameter to correct absorption in EDXS spectra. After different
delays of immersion of bioactive glass particles in a simulated biological
solution, results show the formation of different surface layers at the
bioactive glass periphery. Before one day of immersion, we observe the presence
of an already shown (Si,O,Al) rich layer at the periphery. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a thin electron dense (Si,O) layer is formed on top of the
(Si,O,Al) layer. In this (Si,O) layer, depleted in aluminium, we point out an
increase of oxygen weight concentration which can be interpreted by the
presence of Si(OH)4 groups, that permit the formation of a (Ca,P) layer.
Aluminium plays a role in the glass solubility and may inhibit apatite
nucleation. After the beginning of the (Ca,P) layer formation, the size of the

micron vacuum channels around a chip containing 160000 electrodes and
associated classical control circuits; 1000 laser beam pairs are used to
manipulate the hyperfine states of the ions and drive fluorescence for readout.
The computer could run a quantum algorithm requiring 10^9 logical operations on
300 logical qubits, with a physical gate rate of 1 MHz and a logical gate rate
of 8 kHz, using methods for quantum gates that have already been experimentally
implemented. Routes for faster operation are discussed.

the effect of noise, we apply a model based on a generalized effective
Hamiltonian where the system-environment interactions are taken into account by
including stochastic fluctuating terms in the system Hamiltonian. This noise
model enables us to investigate the effect of noise in quantum circuits under
realistic device conditions and avoid strong assumptions such as maximal
parallelism and weak storage errors. Noise thresholds of the QEC codes are
calculated. In addition, the effects of imprecision in projective measurements,
collective bath, fault-tolerant repetition protocols, and level of parallelism
in circuit constructions on the threshold values are also studied with emphasis
on determining the optimal design for the fault-tolerant QEC circuit. These
results provide insights into the fault-tolerant QEC process as well as useful
information for designing the optimal fault-tolerant QEC circuit for particular
physical implementation of quantum computer.
