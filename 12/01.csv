structure on cosmological parameters, in models that are constrained to match
observations of the projected galaxy correlation function w(rp). For a sequence
of cosmological models with a fixed P(k) shape and increasing normalization
\sig8, we find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that
reproduce SDSS measurements of w(rp) as a function of luminosity. Using these
HOD models we calculate mean M/L ratios as a function of halo mass and populate
halos of N-body simulations to compute M/L in larger scale environments,
including cluster infall regions. For all cosmological models, the M/L ratio in
high mass halos or high density regions is approximately independent of halo
mass or smoothing scale. However, the ""plateau"" value of M/L depends on \sig8
as well as \Omega_m, and it represents the universal mass-to-light ratio <M/L>
only for models in which the galaxy correlation function is approximately
unbiased, i.e., with \sig8 ~ \sig8_gal. Our results for cluster mass halos
follow the trend M/L = 577(\Omega_m/0.3)(\sig8/0.9)^{1.7} h Msun/Lsun. Combined
with Carlberg et al.'s (1996) mean M/L ratio of CNOC galaxy clusters, this
relation implies (\sig8/0.9)(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.6} = 0.75 +/- 0.06. M/L ratios of
clusters from the SDSS and CAIRNS surveys yield similar results. This
constraint is inconsistent with parameter values \Omega_m ~ 0.3, \sig8 ~ 0.9
favored by recent joint analyses of CMB measurements and other large-scale
structure data. We discuss possible resolutions, none of which seems entirely
satisfactory. Appendices present an improved formula for halo bias factors and
an improved analytic technique for calculating the galaxy correlation function
from a given cosmological model and HOD. (Abridged)

early-type galaxies showing emission lines, we present intermediate resolution
spectra of 50 galaxies in the nearby Universe. The sample, which covers several
of the E and S0 morphological sub-classes, is biased toward objects that might
be expected to have ongoing and recent star formation, at least in small
amounts, because of the presence of the emission lines. The emission are
expected to come from the combination of active galactic nuclei and star
formation regions within the galaxies. Sample galaxies are located in
environments corresponding to a broad range of local galaxy densities, although
predominantly in low density environments. Our long-slit spectra cover the 3700
- 7250 A wavelength range with a spectral resolution of about 7.6 A at 5550 A.
The specific aim of this paper, and our first step on the investigation, is to
map the underlying galaxy stellar population by measuring, along the slit,
positioned along the galaxy major axis, line--strength indices at several,
homogeneous galacto-centric distances. For each object we extracted 7
luminosity weighted apertures corrected for the galaxy ellipticity and 4
gradients and we measured 25 line-strength indices. The paper introduces the
sample, presents the observations, describes the data reduction procedures, the
extraction of apertures and gradients, the determination and correction of the
line--strength indices, the procedure adopted to transform them into the
Lick-IDS System and the procedures adopted for the emission correction. We
finally discuss the comparisons between our dataset and line-strength indices

use a procedure which takes fair account of the uncertainties in the functional

use of strong prior constraints. We apply the procedure to current data from
WMAP, SDSS, and the supernova searches, and obtain results that are consistent
with other analyses using different combinations of data sets. The effects of
systematic experimental errors and variations in the analysis technique are
discussed. Next, we use the same procedure to forecast the dark energy
constraints achieveable by the end of the decade, assuming 8 years of WMAP data
and realistic projections for ground-based measurements of supernovae and weak
lensing. We find the $2 \sigma$ constraints on the current value of $w$ to be
$\Delta w_0 (2 \sigma) = 0.20$, and on $dw/dz$ (between $z=0$ and $z=1$) to be
$\Delta w_1 (2 \sigma)=0.37$. Finally, we compare these limits to other
projections in the literature. Most show only a modest improvement; others show
a more substantial improvement, but there are serious concerns about
systematics. The remaining uncertainty still allows a significant span of
competing dark energy models. Most likely, new kinds of measurements, or
experiments more sophisticated than those currently planned, are needed to
reveal the true nature of dark energy.

FSRQ jets. The X-ray morphology is varied, but in general closely matches the

investigated in a model for acceleration and pair cascades on open field lines
above the polar caps. Although these pulsars have low surface magnetic fields,
their short periods allow them to have large magnetospheric potential drops,
but the majority do not produce sufficient pairs to completely screen the
accelerating electric field. The accelerating particles maintain high Lorentz
factors and undergo cyclotron resonant absorption of radio emission, that
produces and maintains a large pitch angle, resulting in a strong synchrotron
component. The resulting spectra consist of several distinct components:
curvature radiation from primary electrons dominating from 1 - 100 GeV,
synchrotron radiation from primary and secondary electrons dominating up to
about 100 MeV, and much weaker inverse-Compton radiation from primary electrons
at 0.1 - 1 TeV. We find that the relative size of these components depends on
pulsar period, period derivative, and neutron star mass and radius with the
level of the synchrotron component also depending sensitively on the radio
emission properties. This model is successful in describing the observed X-ray
and gamma-ray spectrum of PSR J0218+4232 as synchrotron radiation, peaking
around 100 MeV and extending up to a turnover around several GeV. The predicted
curvature radiation components from a number of millisecond pulsars, as well as
the collective emission from the millisecond pulsars in globular clusters,
should be detectable with AGILE and GLAST. We also discuss a hidden population
of X-ray-quiet and radio-quiet millisecond pulsars which have evolved below the
pair death line, some of which may be detectable by telescopes sensitive above
1 GeV.

found in the Groth Strip Survey (GSS), with 0.73< z < 1.04 and with bulge
magnitudes I <= 23. The exponential disk light is removed via decomposition of
HST images using GIM2D. We find that 85% of these bulges are nearly as red as
local E/S0's and have a shallow slope and a small color dispersion in the
color-luminosity relation, suggesting roughly coeval formation. The surface
brightnesses of these bulges are about 1 mag higher than local bulges. These
results are explained adopting a ""drizzling"" scenario where a metal-rich early
formation is later polluted by small amounts of additional star formation.
Almost all disks have the same or bluer colors than their accompanying bulges,
regardless of the bulge-disk ratio and bulge luminosity, as expected from
semi-analytic hierarchical galaxy formation models. We present evidence that
the few blue bulge candidates are not likely to be genuine blue ellipticals or
bulges. Our deeper, more extensive, and less disk-contaminated observations
challenge prior claims that 30% to 50% of field bulges or ellipticals are in a
blue, star-forming phase at z < 1. We conclude that field bulges and
ellipticals at z ~ 1, like luminous early- type cluster galaxies at the same
redshift, are already dominated by metal-rich, old stellar populations that
have been fading from a formation epoch earlier than z ~ 1.5. (abridged)

state radio power-law extrapolated forward in energy meets the backward
extrapolated X-ray power-law at an IR spectral break, which was explicitly
observed twice in GX339-4. This has been cited as further evidence that jet
synchrotron radiation might make a significant contribution to the observed
X-rays in the hard state. We explore this hypothesis with a series of
simultaneous radio/X-ray hard state observations of GX339-4. We fit these
spectra with a simple, but remarkably successful, doubly broken power-law model
that indeed requires a spectral break in the IR. For most of these
observations, the break position as a function of X-ray flux agrees with the
jet model predictions. We then examine the radio flux/X-ray flux correlation in
Cyg X-1 through the use of 15 GHz radio data, obtained with the Ryle radio
telescope, and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data, from the All Sky Monitor and
pointed observations. We find evidence of `parallel tracks' in the radio/X-ray
correlation which are associated with `failed transitions' to, or the beginning
of a transition to, the soft state. We also find that for Cyg X-1 the radio
flux is more fundamentally correlated with the hard, rather than the soft,

(except for $\rm H_\beta$) substantially smaller. In other words binary
evolution makes a population appear bluer. This effect raises the derived age

  We calculate several sets of additional solar-metallicity binary stellar
populations to explore the influence of input parameters to the binary
evolution algorithm (the common-envelope ejection efficiency and the stellar
wind mass-loss rate) on the resulting integrated colours. We also look at the
dependence on the choice of distribution functions used to generate the initial
binary population. The results show that variations in the choice of input
model parameters and distributions can significantly affect the results.
However, comparing the discrepancies that exist between the colours of various
models, we find that the differences are less than those produced between the
models with and those without binary interactions. Therefore it is very
necessary to consider binary interactions in order to draw accurate conclusions
from evolutionary population synthesis work.

we show upper limits from some radio observations of globular clusters, and

radiation address the question of the sources (nucleosynthetic s- and
r-processes). As such, the determination of CR source abundances is a promising
way to discriminate between existing nucleosynthesis models. For primary
species (nuclei present and accelerated at sources), it is generally assumed
that the relative propagated abundances, if they are close in mass, are not too
different from their relative source abundances. Besides, the range of the
correction factor associated to propagation has been estimated in weighted slab
models only. Heavy CRs that are detected near Earth were accelerated from
regions that are closer to us than were the light nuclei. Hence, the geometry
of sources in the Solar neighbourhood, and as equally important, the geometry
of gas in the same region, must be taken into account. In this paper, a two
zone diffusion model is used, and as was previously investigated for
radioactive species, we report here on the impact of the local interstellar
medium (LISM) feature (under-dense medium over a scale ~100 pc) on primary and
secondary stable nuclei propagated abundances. Going down to Fe nuclei, the
connection between heavy and light abundances is also inspected. A general
trend is found that decreases the UHCR source abundances relative to the HCR
ones. This could have an impact on the level of r-process required to reproduce
the data.

parameterized through the conditional luminosity function, indicates the
presence of two characteristic scales in galaxy formation: one at ~10^{11}
Msun, where galaxy formation is most efficient, and another at ~10^{13} Msun,
where a transition occurs from systems dominated by one brightest, central
galaxy to systems with several dominant galaxies of comparable luminosity. We
show that the relation between light and mass established from galaxy
clustering alone is in excellent agreement with the dynamical masses inferred
from satellite kinematics. We also present a new (halo-based) galaxy-group
finder, and show that the multiplicity function of galaxy groups identified in
the 2dFGRS suggests a relatively high mass-to-light ratio on the scales of

and the resulting stellar masses are in the range 3-6.5x10^{11} M_sun. The
analysis we performed unambiguously shows the early-type nature of their
spectra. The 7 massive evolved galaxies account for a comoving density of
\~5.5(+-2) x 10^{-5} Mpc^{-3} at <z>~1.5, a factor 1.5 lower than the density
(8.4(+-1) x 10^{-5} Mpc^{-3}) of early-types with comparable masses at z=0. The
incompleteness (30%) of our spectroscopic observations accounts for this
discrepancy. Thus, our data do not support a decrease of the comoving density
of early-type galaxies with masses comparable to the most massive ones in the
local Universe up to z~1.7. This suggests that massive evolved galaxies do not
play an important role in the evolution of the mass density outlined by recent
surveys in this redshift range, evolution which instead has to be ascribed to
the accretion of the stellar mass in late-type galaxies. Finally, the presence
of such massive evolved galaxies at these redshifts suggests that the assembly
of massive spheroids has taken place at z>2 supporting a high efficiency in the
accretion of the stellar mass in massive halos in the early Universe.

system 4U 1700-37/HD 153919, carried out with XMM-Newton in February 2001. The
system was observed at four orbital phase intervals, covering 37% of one
3.41-day orbit. The lightcurve includes strong flares, commonly observed in
this source. We focus on three epochs in which the data are not affected by
photon pile up: the eclipse, the eclipse egress and a low-flux interval in the
lightcurve around orbital phase phi ~0.25. The high-energy part of the
continuum is modelled as a direct plus a scattered component, each represented
by a power law with identical photon index (alpha ~1.4), but with different
absorption columns. We show that during the low-flux interval the continuum is
strongly reduced, probably due to a reduction of the accretion rate onto the
compact object. A soft excess is detected in all spectra, consistent with
either another continuum component originating in the outskirts of the system
or a blend of emission lines. Many fluorescence emission lines from
near-neutral species and discrete recombination lines from He- and H-like
species are detected during eclipse and egress. The detection of recombination
lines during eclipse indicates the presence of an extended ionised region
surrounding the compact object. The observed increase in strength of some
emission lines corresponding to higher values of the ionisation parameter xi
further substantiates this conclusion.

examining the heating mechanism of PAHs after hard photon interactions. On the
radiative transfer side first a most economic model is presented where three
parameters, luminosity, effective size and extinction of the nucleus are varied
to obtain SED fits. A full grid of model spectra are made available at:
""http://www.eso.org/~rsiebenm/agn_models"". This model is sufficient to account
for ISO broad band data of a sample of 68 radio galaxies and quasars of the 3CR
catalogue. The hot dust component detected is mainly due to small grains and
PAHs. In such models, type 1 AGNs are represented by a compact dust
distribution with warm grains and weak PAH emission. In AGNs of type 2, the
dust appears to be more extended, relatively colder and PAH bands are strong.
Realistic AGN models which are consistent with the unification need to explain
the overall absence of the 9.7mic. silicate emission feature. This can be done
by considering various geometries (tapered discs). Models which combine AGN and
starburst activity are presented for galaxies with hidden broad line region. It
is found that the AGN torus dominate the mid IR continuum emission and that the
starbursts dominate the PAH band as well as the far infrared and submillimeter
emission.

theory we find an ideal glass transition generated due to precursors of
orientational order which depend on X and p, the aspect ratio and packing
fraction of the ellipsoids. The glass formation of oblate ellipsoids is
enhanced compared to that for prolate ones. For oblate ellipsoids with X <~ 0.7

the fact that, if the Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappa does not depend on

leading to a simple relation between magnetizations at different temperatures.
Although this scaling procedure does not provide absolute values of the upper
critical fieldH_c2(T), its temperature variation can be established rather
accurately. This provides an opportunity to validate theoretical models that
are usually employed for the evaluation of H_c2(T) from equilibrium
magnetization data. In the second part of the paper we apply this scaling
procedure for a discussion of the notorious first order phase transition in the
mixed state of high temperature superconductors. Our analysis, based on
experimental magnetization data available in the literature, shows that the
shift of the magnetization accross the transition may adopt either sign,
depending on the particular chosen sample. We argue that this observation is
inconsistent with the interpretation that this transition always represents the
melting transition of the vortex lattice.

obtained by maximizing Tsallis entropy under q constraints. We further ask why
nature fixes the separation constant Q to 1 in so many cases leading to

appropriate generalizations of plane waves (`Yang-Mills pp-waves'),

shown that these radiative Yang-Mills and l.z.r.m. fields, given on a finite

unconstrained data set on a closed spacelike 2-surface, the `edge of D'. These
pure radiative solutions are shown to determine a dense subset in the set of

show that considerable resolution is required to extract accurate physical

to achieve control of the main systematic errors. For comparison we perform a

show that the leading correction is consistent with what one expects if the
flux tube behaves like a simple bosonic string at long distances. We obtain
similar but less accurate results for stable (k-)strings in higher
representations. We find some evidence that for k>1 the length scale at which
the bosonic string correction becomes dominant increases as N increases. We
perform all these calculations not just for long strings, up to about 2.5`fm'
in length, but also for shorter strings, down to the minimum length, lc = 1/Tc,
where Tc is the deconfining temperature. We find that the mass of the
ground-state string, at all length scales, is not very far from the simple
Nambu-Goto string theory prediction, and that the fit improves as N increases
from N=4 to N=6. We estimate the mass of the first excited string and find that
it also follows the Nambu-Goto prediction, albeit more qualitatively. We
comment upon the significance of these results for the string description of

without spontaneous symmetry breaking via condensation of Higgs scalar fields.
This appears very naturally in models derived from string theory and
supergravity. The simplest scenarios of this type consist of extensions of the
Standard Model (SM) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) by an
extra U(1)_X gauge group with Stueckelberg type couplings. For the SM, the
physical spectrum is extended by a massive neutral gauge boson Z' only, while
the extension of the MSSM contains a CP-even neutral scalar and two extra
neutralinos. The new gauge boson Z' can be very light compared to other models
with U(1)' extensions. Among the new features of the Stueckelberg extension of
the MSSM, the most striking is the possibility of a new lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) chi_{St}^0 which is mostly composed of Stueckelberg fermions. In
this scenario the LSP of the MSSM chi_1^0 is unstable and decays into
chi_{St}^0. Such decays alter the signatures of supersymmetry and have impact
on searches for supersymmetry in accelerator experiments. Further, with
R-parity invariance, chi_{St}^0 is the new candidate for dark matter.

for the hybrid meson, which may be normalized thanks to its relation to the
energy momentum tensor and to the QCD sum rules technique. The hard amplitude
is considered up to next-to-leading order in $\alpha_{S}$ and we explore the
consequences of fixing the renormalization scale ambiguity through the BLM

Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type dark energy models. The DBI action based on string
theory naturally gives rise to a coupling between gauge fields and a scalar
field responsible for accelerated expansion of the universe. This leads to the
change of alpha due to a dynamical evolution of the scalar field, which can be
compatible with the recently observed cosmological data around the redshift
$\tilde{z} \lesssim 3$. We place constraints on several different DBI models
including exponential, inverse power-law and rolling massive scalar potentials.
We find that these models can satisfy the varying alpha constraint provided
that mass scales of the potentials are fine-tuned. When we adopt the mass
scales which are motivated by string theory, both exponential and inverse
power-law potentials give unacceptably large change of alpha, thus ruled out
from observations. On the other hand the rolling massive scalar potential is
compatible with the observationally allowed variation of alpha. Therefore the
information of varying alpha provides a powerful way to distinguish between a

the sound speed eventually reach unity permits matching conventional

moving in a trap in $\mathbb {R}^d$ under mutually repellent forces. The two
models are defined in terms of transformed path measures on finite time
intervals under a trap Hamiltonian and two respective pair-interaction
Hamiltonians. The first pair interaction exhibits a particle repellency, while
the second one imposes a path repellency. We analyze both models in the limit
of diverging time with fixed number $N$ of Brownian motions. In particular, we
prove large deviations principles for the normalized occupation measures. The
minimizers of the rate functions are related to a certain associated operator,
the Hamilton operator for a system of $N$ interacting trapped particles. More
precisely, in the particle-repellency model, the minimizer is its ground state,
and in the path-repellency model, the minimizers are its ground product-states.
In the case of path-repellency, we also discuss the case of a Dirac-type
interaction, which is rigorously defined in terms of Brownian intersection
local times. We prove a large-deviation result for a discrete variant of the
model. This study is a contribution to the search for a mathematical
formulation of the quantum system of $N$ trapped interacting bosons as a model
for Bose--Einstein condensation, motivated by the success of the famous 1995
experiments. Recently, Lieb et al. described the large-N behavior of the ground
state in terms of the well-known Gross--Pitaevskii formula, involving the
scattering length of the pair potential. We prove that the large-N behavior of
the ground product-states is also described by the Gross--Pitaevskii formula,
however, with the scattering length of the pair potential replaced by its
integral.

Following Malvenuto and Reutenauer, we pass from symmetric functions to

permutations in order to relate the internal and external products to the
composition and convolution of linear endomorphisms of the tensor algebra. The
new product we construct corresponds to the smash product of endomorphisms of
the tensor algebra. For symmetric functions, the smash product is given by a
construction which combines induction and restriction of representations. For
non-commutative symmetric functions, the structure constants of the smash

increments are anomalous, or that the departures from Kolmogorov's (1941)
self-similar scaling increase nonlinearly with the increasing order of the
moment. This appears to be true whether one considers velocity increments
themselves or their absolute values. However, moments of order lower than 2 of
the absolute values of velocity increments have not been investigated
thoroughly for anomaly. Here, we discuss the importance of the scaling of
non-integer moments of order between +2 and -1, and obtain them from direct
numerical simulations at moderate Reynolds numbers (Taylor microscale Reynolds
numbers $R_\lambda \le$ 450) and experimental data at high Reynolds numbers
($R_\lambda \approx$ 10,000). The relative difference between the measured
exponents and Kolmogorov's prediction increases as the moment order decreases
towards -1, thus showing that the anomaly that is manifest in high-order
moments is present in low-order moments as well. This conclusion provides a
motivation for seeking a theory of anomalous scaling as the order of the moment
vanishes. Such a theory does not have to consider rare events--which may be
affected by non-universal features such as shear--and so may be regarded as
advantageous to consider and develop.

and time scales, while only a microscopic evolution law is known. For such
time-dependent multi-scale problems, an ""equation-free"" framework has been
proposed, of which patch dynamics is an essential component. Patch dynamics is
designed to perform numerical simulations of an unavailable macroscopic
equation on macroscopic time and length scales; it uses appropriately
initialized simulations of the available microscopic model in a number of small
boxes (patches), which cover only a fraction of the space-time domain. To
reduce the effect of the artificially introduced box boundaries, we use buffer
regions to ""shield"" the boundary artefacts from the interior of the domain for
short time intervals. We analyze the accuracy of this scheme for a diffusion
homogenization problem with periodic heterogeneity, and propose a simple
heuristic to determine a sufficient buffer size. The algorithm performance is
illustrated through a set of numerical examples, which include a non-linear
reaction-diffusion equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation.

proteins. One of them involves crossing of a threshold value of the RMSD
distance away from the native state. Another checks whether all native contacts
are established, i.e. whether the interacting amino acids come closer than some
characteristic distance. We use Go-like models of proteins and show that such
simple criteria may prompt one to declare folding even though fragments of the
resulting conformations have a wrong sense of chirality. We propose that a
better condition of folding should augment the simple criteria with the
requirement that most of the local values of the chirality should be nearly
native. The kinetic discrepancy between the simple and compound criteria can be
substantially reduced in the Go-like models by providing the Hamiltonian with a
term which favors native values of the local chirality. We study the effects of
this term as a function of its amplitude and compare it to other models such as
with the side groups and with the angle-dependent potentials.

  Methods: Two questionnaires, the Systemizing Quotient (SQ) and the Empathy
Quotient (EQ), were administered to a normal control group and a group of
individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or High-Functioning Autism (HFA). The
multivariate correlations of the joint scores were analysed using principal
components analysis.
  Results: The principal components were well-approximated by the sums and
differences of the SQ and EQ scores. The differences in the scores corresponded
to sex differences within the control group and also separated out the AS/HFA
group, which showed stronger systemizing than the control group, but
below-average empathy. The sums of the scores did not show sex differences, but
did distinguish the AS/HFA group.
  Conclusions: These tests reliably sex the brain, and their correlations show
that empathizing and systemizing are not independent, but compete neurally.
Their combined score (EQ + SQ) quantifies the deficit in autism spectrum
conditions.

normalize the generalized Pauli group). We then investigate the action of the
extended Clifford group operators on symmetric informationally complete POVMs

We show that each of the fiducial vectors which has been constructed so far

suggests a strengthening of a conjuecture of Zauner's. We give a complete

illustrate this point by constructing exact expressions for fiducial vectors in

(26 and 52 kHz) due to a new mechanism present for any electron spin with S>1/2

spin (S=3/2) and nuclear spin (I=1) in the endohedral fullerene N@C60. The

tighter for incomplete measurements. The most general quantum operations may be
both incomplete and inefficient. Here we show that the bound derived by SWW can
be further extended to obtain one which is yet again tighter for inefficient
measurements. This allows us in addition to obtain a generalization of a bound
derived by Hall, and to show that the average reduction in the von Neumann
entropy during a quantum operation is concave in the initial state, for all
quantum operations. This is a quantum version of the concavity of the mutual
information. We also show that both this average entropy reduction, and the
mutual information for pure state ensembles, are Schur-concave for unitarily
covariant measurements; that is, for these measurements, information gain
increases with initial uncertainty.
