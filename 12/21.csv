All relevant cosmic ray interactions are taken into account, including
photo-disintegration and propagation of secondary products. Iron injection
predicts spectral shapes different from proton injection which disagree with
existing data below about 30 EeV. Injection of light nuclei or protons must
therefore contribute at these energies. However, at higher energies, existing
data are consistent with injection of pure iron with spectral indices between 2
and 2.4. This allows a significant recovery of the spectrum above roughly 100
EeV, especially in the case of large deflections. Significant auto-correlation
and anisotropy, and considerable cosmic variance are also predicted in this
energy range. The mean atomic mass A fluctuates considerably between different
scenarios. At energies below 60 EeV, if the observed A > 35, magnetic fields
must have a negligible effect on propagation. At the highest energies the
observed flux will be dominated by only a few sources whose location may be
determined by next generation experiments to within 10-20 degrees even if
extra-galactic magnetic fields are important.

sample of typical sources, the optical SEDs form a relatively uniform set, all
exhibiting quasi-power-law spectra with Fnu proportional to nu^alpha, where
0.5<alpha<1.5 (steeper than the canonical nu^1/3 disk spectrum). All become
flatter in the UV, although there is more diversity here. The SEDs studied can
be broadly divided into two optical-UV spectral states. The UV-hard spectra,
e.g. A0620-00 and X-ray Nova Muscae 1991, continue to rise in the far-UV. The
UV-soft spectra, e.g. GRO J0422+32, drop off. XTE J1859+226 evolved from
UV-soft to UV-hard as it decayed indicating that this effect is a real
difference, not a dereddening artifact. All of the spectra can be fitted by a
generalized black body disk model with two forms of heating, resulting in the
two states. The UV-soft state is consistent with a disk illuminated by a
central point source, with irradiative heating dominating over viscous. The
UV-hard state is well described by a viscously heated disk, although this
requires very high mass flow rates in the case of Nova Muscae. Alternatively, a
UV-hard spectrum can be produced if the disk is illuminated by a vertically
extended X-ray source such as a central scattering corona or jet. [Abridged]

signal source orientation. However, the jets extend into the cores, where they
are faster and more compact. Special-relativistic effects then cause jet
brightness and variability time-scales across the electromagnetic spectrum to
be strong functions of jet orientation. Jet X-ray emission is confused, to
varying degrees, with that from the central engine, but can be measured, at

used to infer the properties of the shocked pulsar wind. However theoretical
and numerical models have been presented so far only in the hydrodynamical (HD)

  Vietnam ""New Views on the Universe""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The thermal properties of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters are
usually compared to observations by relying on the emission-weighted
temperature T_ew, instead of on the spectroscopic X-ray temperature T_spec,
which is obtained by actual observational data. Here we show that, if the
intra-cluster medium is thermally complex, T_ew fails at reproducing T_spec. We
propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-like temperature, T_sl, which
approximates T_spec better than a few per cent. By analyzing a set of
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, we also find that T_sl is lower
than T_ew by 20-30 per cent. As a consequence, the normalization of the M-T
relation from the simulations is larger than the observed one by about 50 per
cent. If masses in simulated clusters are estimated by following the same
assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and beta-model gas density profile, as
often done for observed clusters, then the M-T relation decreases by about 40
per cent, and significantly reduces its scatter. Based on this result, we
conclude that using the observed M-T relation to infer the amplitude of the
power spectrum from the X--ray temperature function could bias low sigma_8 by
10-20 per cent. This may alleviate the tension between the value of sigma_8
inferred from the cluster number density and those from cosmic microwave
background and large scale structure.

line,the feature has an equivalent width of 40-100eV and full-width at half
maximum of greater than 20,000 km/s, however the exact properties of this weak
line are highly dependent upon the chosen continuum model. The width of the
line suggests an origin in the inner accretion disk, which is, however,
inconsistent with the lack of Compton reflection. We find that much of the
broad residual emission can be attributed to continuum curvature. The data are
consistent with a model in which the primary powerlaw continuum is reprocessed
by an accretion disk which is truncated as small radii. Alternatively, the
primary source could be partially covered by a dense absorber. The latter model
is less attractive than the former because of the small inclination angle of
the jet of 3C 111 to the line of sight. We consider it likely that the curved
continuum of the partial covering model is fortuitously similar to the
continuum shape of the reprocessing model. In both models, the fit is greatly
improved by the addition of an unresolved Fe K alpha emission line, which could
arise either in a Compton-thin obscuring torus or dense clouds lying along the
line of sight. We also find that there are unacceptable residuals at low
energies in the MOS data in particular, which were modeled as a Gaussian with
an energy of ~1.5 keV; we attribute these residuals to calibration

understanding of how intergalactic halos affect magnification ratios. It is
found that intergalactic halos can produce anomalies at a similar level to
those that are observed. Intergalactic halos with masses <10^10 Msun are
expected to cause relative deflections between images of order 10
milliarcseconds, which are then magnified by the primary lens. They will also
cause fluctuations in the surface density on the several percent level. The
importance of intergalactic halos depends strongly on the radial profile of the
halos and the primordial power spectrum at small scales. Strongly lensed
quasars provide an opportunity to probe these properties. A strong dependence
on the QSO redshift is predicted and can be used to distinguish between

open cluster IMFs, concentrating on the neglected mass range from 1 to 15
M${_\odot}$. The prevalent belief in a universal IMF appears to be without
basis for this mass range. Two recent estimates of the field star IMF using
different methods and samples give values of the average logarithmic slope
$\Gamma$ between -1.7 and -2.1 in the mass range 1.1 to 4 M${_\odot}$. Two
older estimates between 2 and 15 M${_\odot}$ disagree severely; the field IMF
in this range is essentially unknown from star counts. Variations in $\Gamma$
among open cluster IMFs in this mass range have not decreased despite numerous
detailed studies, even for studies using homogeneous data and reduction
procedures and including only clusters with a significant mass range. These
cluster variations \textit{might} be due to the combined effects of sampling,
systematic errors, stellar evolution uncertainties, dynamical evolution, and
unresolved binaries. If so, then the cluster data are consistent with a
universal IMF, but are also consistent with sizeable variations. The cluster
data do not allow an estimate of an average IMF or $\Gamma$ because the average
depends on the choice of weighting procedure and other effects. If the spread
in cluster IMFs is in excess of the effects listed above, real IMF variations
must occur that do not depend much on physical conditions explored so far. The
complexity of the star formation process seen in observations and simulations
suggests that large realization-to-realization differences might be expected,
in which case an individual cluster IMF would be in part the product of
evolutionary contingency in star formation, and the function of interest is the
probability distribution of IMF parameters.

revolution in understanding by synthesizing data taken at many wavelengths, the
universe has only barely been glimpsed in neutrinos, just the Sun and the
nearby SN 1987A. An entire universe awaits, and since neutrinos can probe
astrophysical objects at densities, energies, and distances that are otherwise
inaccessible, the results are expected to be particularly exciting. Similarly,
the revolution in quantitative cosmology has heightened the need for very
precise tests that depend on the effects of neutrinos, and prominent among them
is the search for the effects of neutrino mass, since neutrinos are a small but
known component of the dark matter. In this report, we highlight some of the

distribution of the plasma through a combination of global and local fits. The
X-ray luminosity and the spectral shape of V603 Aql resemble those of SS Cyg in
transition between quiescence and outburst. The fact that the X-ray flux
variability is only weakly energy dependent can be interpreted by supposing
that the variability is due to changes in the maximum temperature of the

likely to be compact. Finally, the apparent overabundance of Ne is consistent
with V603 Aql being a young system.

grow with energy. In solids and liquids, at energies above $10^{20}$ eV,
photonuclear reactions dominate, and showers that originate as photons or

showers are much shorter (due to the absence of the LPM effect), but wider than
purely electromagnetic showers would be. This change in shape alters the

X-ray halo correspond to the large scale radio lobes, and interpreting these as
cavities inflated with radio plasma we infer a jet power of 4x10^42 erg/s. Both
radio lobes contain hot spots that are detected by Chandra. In addition, the
southern hot spot is detected in the 1.4 GHz LBA observation, providing the
highest linear resolution image of a radio lobe hot spot to date. The northern
hot spot was not detected in the LBA observation. The radio to X-ray spectra of
the hot spots are consistent with a simple power law emission model. The
nucleus has an X-ray spectrum typical of a type 1 active galactic nucleus, and
the LBA observation shows a one-sided nuclear jet on 0.1"" scales. Approximately
10"" northeast of the nucleus, X-ray emission is associated with an
extra-nuclear cloud. The X-ray emission from the cloud can be divided into two
regions, an unresolved western component associated with a knot of radio
emission (in a low resolution map), and a spatially extended eastern component
aligned with the pc-scale jet and associated with highly ionized optical
line-emitting clouds. The X-ray spectrum of the eastern component is very soft
(Gamma > 4.0 for a power law model or kT ~0.22 keV for a thermal plasma). The

produces a level of non-Gaussianity which is known to be small, but can
contribute to the anisotropy trispectrum at the same level as lensing. In this
work, we study whether the primordial non-Gaussianity can mask the lensing
statistics. We concentrate only on the ``temperature quadratic estimator'' of
lensing, which will be nearly optimal for the Planck satellite, and work in the
flat-sky approximation. We find that primordial non-Gaussianity contaminates
the deflection field estimator by roughly (0.1 f_NL)% at large angular scales,
which represents at most a 10% contribution, not sufficient to threaten lensing
extraction, but enough to be taken into account.

ionization of H I, He I and He II while gammahe controls the rate of heating.

gammahe to compensate for the sigma_8 change. We can also use gammah to adjust
the H I ionization rate to simultaneously match the mean flux. We derive
scaling relations that give the output parameter values expected for a variety

escape through the disk but the electron neutrinos $\nu_e$ are almost absorbed

redshifts z<1 in the hierarchical structure formation scenario to clarify the
nature of DLA galaxies because observational data of such galaxies mainly at
low redshifts are currently available. We find that our model well reproduces
distributions of fundamental properties of DLA galaxies such as luminosities,
column densities, impact parameters obtained by optical and near-infrared
imagings. Our results suggest that DLA systems primarily consist of low
luminosity galaxies with small impact parameters (typical radius about 3 kpc,
surface brightness from 22 to 27 mag arcsec^{-2}) similar to low surface
brightness (LSB) galaxies. In addition, we investigate selection biases arising
from the faintness and from the masking effect which prevents us from
identifying a DLA galaxy hidden or contaminated by a point spread function of a
background quasar. We find that the latter affects the distributions of DLA
properties more seriously rather than the former, and that the observational
data are well reproduced only when taking into account the masking effect. The
missing rate of DLA galaxies by the masking effect attains 60-90 % in the
sample at redshift 0<z<1 when an angular size limit is as small as 1 arcsec.
Furthermore we find a tight correlation between HI mass and cross section of
DLA galaxies, and also find that HI-rich galaxies with M(HI) \sim 10^{9} M_sun
dominate DLA systems. These features are entirely consistent with those from
the Arecibo Dual-Beam Survey which is a blind 21 cm survey. Finally we discuss
star formation rates, and find that they are typically about 10^{-2} M_sun
yr^{-1} as low as those in LSB galaxies.

between the supersonic and subsonic propeller substages. In the trans-sonic
regime an envelope around a magnetosphere of a neutron star passes through a
kind of a reorganization process. The envelope in this regime consists of two
parts. In the bottom one turbulent motions are subsonic. Then at some distance
$r_\mathrm{s}$ the turbulent velocity becomes equal to the sound velocity.
During this substage the boundary $r_\mathrm{s}$ propagates outwards till it
reaches the outer boundary, and so the subsonic regime starts.
  We found that the trans-sonic substage is unstable, so the transition between
supersonic and subsonic substages proceeds on the dynamical time scale. For
realistic parameters this time is in the range from weeks to years.

A bubble raft serves as a model two-dimensional foam and consists of a single

strain, one observes periods of stress increase and decrease. Our focus is on
the distribution of stress decreases, or stress drops. The work is motivated by
apparent disagreements between quasistatic simulations of flowing foam and
simulations of continuous strain for foam. Quasistatic simulations have
reported larger average stress drops than the continuous strain case. Also,
there is evidence in quasistatic simulations for a general divergence of the
average size of the stress drops that only appears to occur in steady strain
near special values of the foam density. In this work, applied step strains are
used as an approximation to quasistatic simulations. We find general agreement

molecular models (diffusive wall). A map of three-dimensional kinetic equations
onto two-dimensional models is established which enables two-dimensional
simulations of quasi-two-dimensional flows. The ELBGK model is studied
extensively in the simulation of the two-dimensional Poiseuille channel flow.
Results are compared to known analytical and numerical studies of this flow in

agreement with analytical results in the domain of weak rarefaction

hydrodynamic scale), up to Kn=0.01, which is the domain of many practical
microflows. Moreover, the results qualitatively agree throughout the entire
Knudsen number range, demonstrating Knudsen's minimum for the mass flow rate at
moderate values of Kn, as well as the logarithmic scaling at large Kn. The

can be considered the output of a self-assembly ``program,'' a set of tiles
that fit together to create a shape. It seems plausible that the size of the
smallest self-assembly program that builds a shape and the shape's
descriptional (Kolmogorov) complexity should be related. We show that when
using a notion of a shape that is independent of scale, this is indeed so: in
the Tile Assembly Model, the minimal number of distinct tile types necessary to
self-assemble a shape, at some scale, can be bounded both above and below in
terms of the shape's Kolmogorov complexity. As part of the proof of the main
result, we sketch a general method for converting a program outputting a shape
as a list of locations into a set of tile types that self-assembles into a
scaled up version of that shape. Our result implies, somewhat
counter-intuitively, that self-assembly of a scaled-up version of a shape often
requires fewer tile types. Furthermore, the independence of scale in
self-assembly theory appears to play the same crucial role as the independence
of running time in the theory of computability. This leads to an elegant
formulation of languages of shapes generated by self-assembly. Considering
functions from integers to shapes, we show that the running-time complexity,
with respect to Turing machines, is polynomially equivalent to the scale
complexity of the same function implemented via self-assembly by a finite set
of tile types. Our results also hold for shapes defined by Wang tiling -- where
there is no sense of a self-assembly process -- except that here time
complexity must be measured with respect to non-deterministic Turing machines.

To analyze the potential of their scheme in terms of the kinds of computations
it can perform, we study an abstraction assuming that a certain class of
restriction enzymes is available and reactions occur without error. We also
discuss how our molecular algorithms could perform with known restriction
enzymes. By exhibiting a way to simulate arbitrary circuits, we show that these
``Benenson automata'' are capable of computing arbitrary Boolean functions.
Further, we show that they are able to compute efficiently exactly those
functions computable by log-depth circuits. Computationally, we formalize a new
variant of limited width branching programs with a molecular implementation.

identification by which it discriminates electrons (electron nutrinos) from

significant deficiency of muons (muon nutrinos), suggesting the existence of
neutrino oscillations. We investigate three areas of concern for the
Super-Kamiokande estimator: the separation of the spatial part from the angular
part in the probability functions, the neglect of fluctuations in the Cherenkov
light in different physical processes due to the charged particles concerned,
and the point-like approximation for the emission of Cherenkov light. We show
that the first two factors are important for the consideration of stochastic
processes in the generation of the Cherenkov light, and that the point-like
assumption oversimplifies the estimation of the Cherenkov light quantities. We
develop a new discrimination procedure for separating electron neutrinos from
muon neutrinos, based on detailed simulations carried out with GEANT~3.21 and
with newly derived mean angular distribution functions for the charged
particles concerned (muons and electrons/positrons), as well as the
corresponding functions for the relative fluctuations. These angular
distribution functions are constructed introducing a ``moving point''
approximation. The application of our procedure between the discrimination
between electron and muon to the analysis of the experimental data in SK will
be made in a subsequent paper.

theory, all quantum corrections to the Higgs mass proportional to mass scales
greater than 1 TeV are absent -- this includes quadratically divergent,
log-divergent, and finite loops at all orders. However, even loops proportional
to scales just a factor of 10 above the Higgs (or any other scalar) mass come
with large numerical factors that reintroduce fine-tuning. Top loops, for
example, produce an expansion parameter of not 1/(4 pi) but 1/5. The geometric
increase in the number of fields at higher energies simply exacerbates this
problem. We build a complete two-stage model up to 100 TeV, show that direct
sensitivity of the electroweak scale to the cutoff is erased, and estimate the
tuning due to large numerical factors. We then discuss the possibility, in a
toy model with only scalar and gauge fields, of generating a tower of little
Higgs theories and show that the theory quickly becomes a large-N gauge theory
with ~ N fundamental scalars. We find evidence that at least this toy model
could successfully generate light scalars with an exponentially large cutoff in
the absence of supersymmetry or strong dynamics. The fine-tuning is not
completely eliminated, but evidence suggests that this result is model
dependent. We then speculate as to how one might marry a working tower of
fields of this type at high scales to a realistic theory at the weak scale.

observables triggered by approximate triality conservation (Polyakov cooling),
so that while the center symmetry breaking is exponentially small with the
constituent quark mass, chiral symmetry restoration is exponentially small with
the pion mass. To illustrate the point we compute some low energy observables
at finite temperature and show that the finite temperature corrections to the
low energy coefficients are $N_c$ suppressed due to color average of the
Polyakov loop. Our analysis also shows how the phenomenology of chiral quark

energies is dominated by events at small-$x_B$ regime. Interesting and complex
physical content of this regime is described by a phenomenological model called
McLerran-Venugopalan Color Glass Condensate (MVCGC) model. The advantage of
this formalism is the existence of a renormalization-type equation which
relates directly observable low energy (small-$x_B$) physics to high energy
scales where one expects the appearance of phenomena beyond Standard model.
After a brief argument about complexity of observations and their
interpretation, we extend CGC to warped space-times with brane boundaries and
show that in a hadron-hadron collision or DIS all the events - and not just
hard processes - have an extended particle distribution in the bulk. In other
word, particles living on the visible brane escape to the bulk. For an observer
on the brane the phenomenon should appear as time decoherence in the outgoing
particles or missing energy, depending on the time particles propagate in the
bulk before coming back to the brane. Assuming that primaries of UHECRs are
nucleons, the interaction of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) in the
terrestrial atmosphere is the most energetic hadron-hadron interaction
available for observation. Using the prediction of CGC for gluon distribution
as well as classical propagation of relativistic particles in the bulk, we

compute the quantum effective action up to one loop for a scalar theory,

model formulation. The perturbation removes the degeneracy of the non-perturbed
curve and allows to identify its singularities with ZZ branes. Also, using the
constructed curve, we find non-perturbative corrections to the free energy and
elucidate their CFT origin.

paradigm shift, Fuzzy Theory proves appropriate. For the past two or more
decades, Fuzzy Theory has become the potent tool to study and analyze
uncertainty involved in all problems. But, many real-world problems also abound
with the concept of indeterminacy. In this book, the new, powerful tool of
neutrosophy that deals with indeterminacy is utilized. Innovative neutrosophic
models are described. The theory of neutrosophic graphs is introduced and
applied to fuzzy and neutrosophic models. This book is organized into four
chapters. In Chapter One we introduce some of the basic neutrosophic algebraic
structures essential for the further development of the other chapters. Chapter
Two recalls basic graph theory definitions and results which has interested us
and for which we give the neutrosophic analogues. In this chapter we give the
application of graphs in fuzzy models. An entire section is devoted for this
purpose. Chapter Three introduces many new neutrosophic concepts in graphs and
applies it to the case of neutrosophic cognitive maps and neutrosophic
relational maps. The last section of this chapter clearly illustrates how the
neutrosophic graphs are utilized in the neutrosophic models. The final chapter
gives some problems about neutrosophic graphs which will make one understand
this new subject.

cite general relativity, extra-dimension, string and super-gravity theories as
physical subjects and also the study of the spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami
operators on p-forms in global analysis. Then, we give expressions for the
Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of a base conformal warped product in terms
of Ricci tensors and scalar curvatures of its base and fiber, respectively.
Furthermore, we introduce specific identities verified by particular families
of, either scalar or tensorial, nonlinear differential operators on
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The latter allow us to obtain new interesting
expressions for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of a special base
conformal warped product and it turns out that not only the expressions but
also the analytical approach used are interesting from the physical,
geometrical and analytical point of view. Finally, we analyze, investigate and
characterize possible solutions for the conformal and warping factors of a
special base conformal warped product, which guarantee that the corresponding
product is Einstein. Besides, we apply these results to a generalization of the

Azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ increases linearly with $p_T$ to a value of 10% at
$p_T$~=~1.5 GeV/$c$. Beyond this $p_T$ the slope decreases indicating a
possible saturation at high $p_T$. Two-pion azimuthal anisotropies ($p_T>$~1.2
GeV/$c$) exceed $v_2$ by about 60% in semicentral collisions and reveal
non-harmonic contributions at close ($\Delta\phi\approx0$) and back-to-back
($\Delta\phi\approx\pi$) angles that can be attributed to semihard processes.
While the close-angle peak remains unchanged, the back-to-back peak is
broadened and disappears in central collisions.

confinement. The genesis of these flows out of turbulent fluctuations is
therefore of significant interest. We investigate the relative importance of
zonal flow generation mechanisms via the Reynolds stress, Maxwell stress, and
geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) transfer in drift-Alfv\'en turbulence. By means of
numerical computations we quantify the energy transfer into zonal flows owing
to each of these effects. The importance of the three driving ingredients in
electrostatic and electromagnetic turbulence for conditions relevant to the
edge of fusion devices is revealed for a broad range of parameters. The
Reynolds stress is found to provide a flow drive, while the electromagnetic
Maxwell stress is in the cases considered a sink for the flow energy. In the
limit of high plasma beta, where electromagnetic effects and Alfv\'en dynamics
are important, the Maxwell stress is found to cancel the Reynolds stress to a
high degree. The geodesic oscillations, related to equilibrium pressure profile
modifications due to poloidally asymmetric transport, can act as both sinks as
drive terms, depending on the parameter regime. For high beta cases the GAMs
are the main drive of the flow. This is also reflected in the frequency
dependence of the flow, showing a distinct peak at the GAM frequency in that
regime.

tools. We have demonstrated that suitable experimental conditions are capable
of producing microholes with record aspect-ratio (up to 600) in pure polymers

results, obtained with the KrF laser, will be reviewed with emphasis on the
parameters leading to formation of good holes with high aspect-ratio. For the

are obtained with regular configuration of the KrF laser giving a standard

the infimum of the quantum relative entropy with respect to the quantum
reference state over the set $\Psi$. However, while in the classical case the
separating subsets can be chosen universal, in the sense that they depend only
on the chosen set of i.i.d. processes, in the quantum case the choice of the
separating subspaces depends additionally on the reference state.

local quantum operations are restricted yields a structure that is analogous in
many respects to that of mixed-state entanglement. Specifically, we develop
this analogy by restricting operations through local superselection rules, and
show that such exotic phenomena as bound entanglement and activation arise
using pure states in this setting. This analogy aids in resolving several
conceptual puzzles in the study of entanglement under restricted operations. In
particular, we demonstrate that several types of quantum optical states that
possess confusing entanglement properties are analogous to bound entangled
states. Also, the classification of pure-state entanglement under restricted
operations can be much simpler than for mixed-state entanglement. For instance,
in the case of local Abelian superselection rules all questions concerning
distillability can be resolved.

of the Schrodinger equation is unclear: Conventional measures fail to detect
chaos in such systems. However, when quantum systems are subjected to
observation -- as all experimental systems must be -- their dynamics is no
longer linear and, in the appropriate limit(s), the evolution of expectation
values, conditioned on the observations, closely approaches the behavior of
classical trajectories. Here we show, by analyzing a specific example, that
microscopic continuously observed quantum systems, even far from any classical
limit, can have a positive Lyapunov exponent, and thus be truly chaotic.

properties. No matter how quanta are detected, they always express the local
net state of the corresponding wave-function. The mechanism behind this process
is still a mystery. However, quantum wave-functions evolve like classical
waves. If they determine all the observations, why do they entail ""weird""
phenomena? In particular, why do they produce conceptual problems, such as the
EPR paradox? It turns out that all the major interpretations in quantum
mechanics are particle-based ontologies. Variables of fundamental interest,
such as momentum and position, are assumed to reflect the input states of
discrete entities, even when their evolution is predicted by wave equations.
Here I show that a whole class of microscopic phenomena, including
entanglement, can be interpreted without contradictions if the variables of
quantum mechanics are actually treated as wave properties. The main
recommendation is to assume that sharp spectral states are transient outcomes
of superposition, rather than permanent input components.

successfully applied to quartic anharmonic oscillators by means of very simple

rather well reproduced for a large range of values of the coupling constant

system of $N$ spin 1/2 particles interacting via a collective spin-spin
coupling described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) Hamiltonian. Under certain
conditions which includes the special case of a super-symmetry, the ground
state can be constructed analytically. In the case of an anti-ferromagnetic
coupling and for an even number of particles this state undergoes a smooth
crossover as a function of the continuous anisotropy parameter $\gamma $ from a
separable ($\gamma =\infty $) to a maximally entangled many-particle state
($\gamma =0$). From the analytic expression for the ground state, bipartite and
global entanglement are calculated. In the thermodynamic limit a discontinuous
change of the scaling behavior of the bipartite entanglement is found at the
isotropy point $\gamma =0$. For $% \gamma =0$ the entanglement grows
logarithmically with the system size with no upper bound, for $\gamma \neq 0$
it saturates at a level only depending on $\gamma $. For finite systems with
total spin $J=N/2$ the scaling behavior changes at $\gamma =\gamma
_{\mathrm{crit}}=1/J$.
