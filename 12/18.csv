of the compact clusters of primordial (relict) black holes produced during the
phase transitions in the early universe. These clusters are the centers of the
dark matter (DM) condensations. As a result the protogalaxies with a mass

large scale structure formation. Black holes merging gives the nowadays
supermassive black holes and reproduces the observed correlations between their

estimate physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more
than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a
base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing
as output the star-formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction
and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) models and observed spectra in the 3650--8000 \AA range. The
reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1)
simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique,
and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of
galaxies from the SDSS. We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable
physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description
of the star-formation and chemical histories. We show that besides providing
excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover
useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly,
stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are
also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. We
apply this synthesis method to a volume limited sample of 50362 galaxies from
the SDSS DR2, producing a catalog of stellar population properties. A
comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of
these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative
agreement. The confidence in the method is further strengthened by several
empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results
and independent quantities.

dispersion of these spectra (6.5-20 km/s) reveals that low ionization species
consist of five discrete components, three at low-to-intermediate velocities,
and two at high velocities (v = +100, +184 km/s). Over the same velocity range,
the higher ionization species show continuous absorption with column density
peaks at v = +10 km/s +184 km/s. The absorption kinematics of the v=+184 km/s
HVC suggest a scenario in which a low-ionization cloud of gas is streaming
through a hot external medium that is stripping gas from this cloud. Using the
OI and HI column densities, we estimate [O/H]=-0.66, with a substantial
uncertainty due to saturation of the HI Lyman series. If the ionization of the
cloud core is photonionization by the extragalactic UV background, we estimate
the cloud has a density of 10^-2.7 cm^-3. If photons escaping the Galactic disk
are also included, the density could be higher by nearly 2 dex. In either case,
the relative abundances of O, Si, and Fe in the cloud core are readily
explained by a solar pattern. Magellanic Stream gas is a possible origin for

the role of rotationally induced mixing in the development of abundance
anomalies in giants with a range of masses and metallicities in stellar
clusters and the field. Unlike most previous work, we do not focus on the
determination of combinations of mixing rate and depth that reproduce the data
on a particular stellar type. Instead, we concentrate on the more fundamental
problem of the simultaneous reproduction of the CNO surface patterns in both
Population I and Population II giants using the same physics and models. A
general result of all our models is that rotational mixing, although present in
small amounts, is inefficient on the lower RGB independently of any inhibiting
effect of composition barriers. Models with differentially rotating envelopes
are able to reproduce the carbon isotope data on M67 giants with initial
rotation rates adequate to their progenitors, but fail to do so for open
clusters of larger turnoff mass as well as for metal-poor giants in the field
and globular clusters. Possible solutions are discussed. Our favored scenario
is one in which the overall strength of canonical extra mixing has been
underestimated by existent derivations, but which additionally needs to be
coupled with a much lower efficiency for rotational mixing among the rapidly
rotating open cluster giants than in the slowly rotating ones in the field and
globular clusters. We hypothesize that this last requirement is provided by the
interaction between convection and rotation in the envelopes of giants, in the
sense that rapidly rotating stars would develop much shallower angular velocity
profiles in their envelopes than do slowly rotating stars.

observations were carried out to test the bowshock hypothesis presented by
Tanner et al. as an alternative to a very recent (10^4 yr) epoch of star
formation within the tidal stream of gas and dust known as the Northern Arm.
Resolved asymmetric structure is detected in all the sources, with bowshock
morphologies associated with IRS 1W, 5, 8 and 10W. For IRS 1W and 10W, there is
an agreement between the position angle of the asymmetry and that of the

that the observed morphology is indeed a bowshock generated by sources plowing
through the Northern Arm. Furthermore, the large extent of the resolved
structures (310-1340 AU) along with their luminosities (~10^4-5 Lsun) suggests
that their central sources are Wolf-Rayet stars, comparable to the broad He
emission-line stars, which have strong winds on the order of 1000 km/s. The
bowshock morphology, along with the proper motion measurements, provide
three-dimensional orbital solutions for this enigmatic class of objects; IRS 1W

cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extragalactic in origin. It is then expected that
interactions of these cosmic rays with photons of the cosmic background
radiation (CBR) should produce a drastic reduction in their flux above and
energy of about $5 \times 10^{19}$ eV (50 EeV), the so-called ``GZK effect''.
At present, the existence of this effect is uncertain owing to conflicting
observational data and small number statistics. We show here that a small
amount of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which could turn off photomeson
interactions of UHECRs with the CBR, could explain the UHECR spectrum as
measured by {\it AGASA} which shows an excess of UHECRs at energies above 100
EeV. If new results from the {\it Auger} array agree with the {\it AGASA}
spectrum, this may be interpreted as evidence for a small amount of LIV. If, on
the other hand, the new results are consistent with the {\it HiRes} results
favoring a GZK effect, this would place severe constraints on LIV and, by
implication, on some Planck scale quantum gravity models. We also discuss the
power requirements needed to explain the UHECR spectrum for a range of
assumptions, including source evolution and LIV and show that in all cases our
results disfavor a $\gamma$-ray burst origin for the UHECRs.

There is no evidence for color variations, with a typical limit of Delta(B-V) <

smaller sample of plates: from approximately 1965 to 1990, the total flux was
modulated with the 48-day orbital period of the binary, but the maximum flux
was larger, the fractional variations were smaller, and the phase of minimum
flux was shifted by almost a half-cycle relative to the modern light curve. All

white dwarf. A high effective temperature is consistent with the expectation
that dwarf nova systems that show standstills, as Z Cam does, have higher than
normal time-averaged mass accretion rates. It is also consistent with current
estimates for the mass and distance to Z Cam. A white dwarf model in which 29%
of the surface has a temperature of 72,000 K and the rest of the surface is at
26,000 K also reproduces the spectral shape and the continuum flux level at the
nominal distance and WD mass, and is a somewhat better statistical fit to the
data. A second component could be due to a rotating accretion belt, a remnant
of an outburst that ended eleven days prior to the FUSE observation, or ongoing
accretion. We favor the uniform temperature model for Z Cam, largely because
the data do not require anything more complicated. We have compared the
quiescent spectrum with an archival spectrum of Z Cam in standstill, obtained
with ORFEUS. The standstill spectrum is described well by a disk accreting at a
rate of 7(-2,+4) 10**16 gm/s, where the errors depend on the assumed
inclination.
  The quiescent spectra cover a full orbital period and are time-resolved to
500 s. No variability was observed in the continuum during the observation, but
the depth of many of the absorption lines increased between orbital phases 0.65
and 0.81. We attribute this effect to absorption by material associated with
the accretion stream, which is easier to understand if the inclination is near
the maximum allowed value of 68 degrees.

the degree of aggregation of the silica in the matrix, which is studied as a
function of pH (4-10), silica volume fraction (3-15%) and silica bead size
(average radius 78 A and 96 A). Rheological properties of the samples are
represented in terms of the strain-dependent reinforcement factor, which
highlights the contribution of the filler. Combining the structural information
with a quantitative analysis of the reinforcement factor, the aggregate size

nanosilica beads for future reinforcement applications is followed by SANS. The

processes occurring at this scale and provides nonlinear kinetic equations for
the rates in terms of the driving forces. The results show that the application
domain of nonequilibrium thermodynamics method to biological systems goes
beyond the linear domain. A model for transport of Ca$^{2+}$ by the
Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, coupled to the hydrolysis of adenosine-triphosphate is
analyzed in detail showing that it depends on the reaction Gibbs energy in a
non-linear way. Our results unify thermodynamic and kinetic descriptions,
thereby opening new perspectives in the study of different transport phenomena

distribution functions show a very good agreement when compared to our Monte
Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations for spherical geometry and with

We report an analysis of the potential vs charge relationship, radial
distribution functions, mean electrostatic potential and cumulative reduced
charge for representative cases of 1:1 and 2:2 salts with a size asymmetry
ratio of 2. Our results are collated with those of the Modified Gouy-Chapman

of HNC/MSA in the restricted primitive model (RPM) to assess the importance of
size asymmetry effects. One of the most striking characteristics found is
that,\textit{contrary to the general belief}, away from the point of zero
charge the properties of an asymmetric electrical double layer (EDL) are not
those corresponding to a symmetric electrolyte with the size and charge of the
counterion, i.e. \textit{counterions do not always dominate}. This behavior
suggests the existence of a new phenomenology in the EDL that genuinely belongs
to a more realistic size-asymmetric model where steric correlations are taken
into account consistently. Such novel features can not be described by
traditional mean field theories like MGC, URMGC or even by enhanced formalisms,
like HNC/MSA, if they are based on the RPM.

the current can decay due to quantum and thermal phase slips. We derive
asymptotic expressions of the decay rate near the critical current. In a three

the microscopic aspects of the condensation energy. The theoretical analysis is
performed on the basis of the FLEX approximation which is a microscopic
description of the spin-fluctuation-induced-superconductivity. Most of phase
transitions in strongly correlated electron system arise from the correlation
energy which is copmetitive to the kinetic energy. However, we show that the
kinetic energy cooperatively induces the superconductivity in the underdoped
region. This unusual decrease of kinetic energy below T_c is induced by the
feedback effect. The feedback effect induces the magnetic resonance mode as
well as the kink in the electronic dispersion, and alters the properties of
quasi-particles, such as mass renormalization and lifetime. The crossover from
BCS behavior to this unusual behavior occurs for hole dopings. On the other
hand, the decrease of kinetic energy below T_c does not occur in the
electron-doped region. We discuss the relation to the recent obserbation of the

quote that ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"" (Aristotle, in
Metaphysics), or the whole cannot exceed the sum of the energies invested in
each of its parts (e.g. first law of thermodynamics) even if it is more
accurate to say that the functional effects produced by wholes are different
from what the parts can produce alone. Synergy is a ubiquitous phenomena in
nature and human societies alike. One well know example is provided by the
emergence of self-organization in social insects, via direct or indirect
interactions. The latter types are more subtle and defined as stigmergy to
explain task coordination and regulation in the context of nest reconstruction
in termites. An example, could be provided by two individuals, who interact
indirectly when one of them modifies the environment and the other responds to
the new environment at a later time. In other words, stigmergy could be defined
as a particular case of environmental or spatial synergy. The system is purely
holistic, and their properties are intrinsically emergent and autocatalytic. On

word matching. It is assumed that the book was digitised as better as possible
and some pre-processing techniques were already applied as line orientation
correction and some noise removal. However two main factor are responsible for
being not possible to apply ordinary optical character recognition techniques
(OCR): the presence of antique fonts and the degraded state of many characters
due to unrecoverable original time degradation. In this paper we make a short
introduction to word segmentation that involves finding the lines that
characterise a word. After we discuss different approaches for word matching
and how they can be combined to obtain an ordered list for candidate words for
the matching. This discussion will be illustrated by examples.

in any original noisy image, and as a consequence also where it is, and in what
amount. In fact, the definition of noise depends largely on our own aim in the
whole image analysis process, and (perhaps more important) in our
self-perception of noise. For instance, when we perceive noise as disconnected
and small it is normal to use MM-ASF filters to treat it. There is two
evidences of this. First, in many instances there is no ideal and pure
noise-free image to compare our filtering process (nothing but our
self-perception of its pure image); second, and related with this first point,
MM transformations that we chose are only based on our self - and perhaps -
fuzzy notion. The present proposal combines the results of two MM filtering
transformations (FT1, FT2) and makes use of some measures and quantitative
relations on their Size/Intensity Diagrams to find the most appropriate noise
removal process. Results can also be used for finding the most appropriate stop
criteria, and the right sequence of MM operators combination on Alternating
Sequential Filters (ASF), if these measures are applied, for instance, on a
Genetic Algorithm's target function.

forbidding a certain class of naked singularities in the spherical collapse of

consider extending the theorem (1) to higher dimensions, (2) by including more
general matter represented by a stress-energy tensor satisfying certain
assumptions, and (3) by replacing the spherical geometry by a toroidal or
higher genus (locally hyperbolic) one. We show that the extension to higher
dimensions and a more general topology is straightforward; on the other hand,
replacing the scalar field by a more general matter content forces us to shrink
the class of naked singularities we are able to exclude. We then show that the
most common matter theories (scalar field interacting with a non-abelian gauge
field and a perfect fluid satisfying certain conditions) obey the assumptions
of our weaker theorem, and we end by commenting on the applicability of our
results to the five-dimensional AdS scenarii considered recently in the
literature.

exclusive processes in ep scattering have shown that the transverse area
occupied by partons with x >= 10^{-2} is much smaller than the size of the
nucleon as it appears in generic inelastic pp collisions at high energies
(""two-scale picture""). We show that this is consistent with the observation
that the elastic pp amplitude at the Tevatron energy is close to the black body
limit at small impact parameters. Our picture implies that inclusive heavy
particle production (Higgs, SUSY) happens only in central pp collisions. At LHC
energies, the final state characteristics of such events are strongly
influenced by the approach to the black body limit, and thus may differ
substantially from what one expects based on the extrapolation of Tevatron
results. Our two-scale picture also allows us to analyze several types of hard
diffractive processes observable at LHC: i) Diffractive proton dissociation
into three jets, which probes small-size configurations in the proton wave
function; ii) exclusive diffractive Higgs production, in which we estimate the

the correct neutralino relic abundance and baryon number asymmetry of the
universe. Both may be efficiently generated in the presence of CP violating
phases, light charginos and neutralinos, and a light top squark. Due to the
coannihilation of the neutralino with the light stop, we find a large region of
parameter space in which the neutralino relic density is consistent with WMAP
and SDSS data. We perform a detailed study of the additional constraints
induced when CP violating phases, consistent with the ones required for
baryogenesis, are included. We explore the possible tests of this scenario from
present and future electron Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) measurements, direct
neutralino detection experiments, collider searches and the b -> s gamma decay
rate. We find that the EDM constraints are quite severe and that electron EDM
experiments, together with stop searches at the Tevatron and Higgs searches at
the LHC, will provide a definite test of our scenario of electroweak
baryogenesis in the next few years.

be produced through the weak decay of the B meson into D^0 \bar D^{*0} K or

long-distance scale set by the scattering length of the charm mesons. The
long-distance factors in the amplitude for the decay B \to XK are determined by
the binding energy of X, while the short-distance factors are essentially
determined by the amplitudes for B \to D^0 \bar D^{*0} K and B \to D^{*0} \bar
D^0 K near the thresholds for the charm mesons. We obtain a crude determination
of the short-distance amplitudes by analyzing data from the Babar collaboration

factorization assumption, heavy quark symmetry, and isospin symmetry. The
resulting order-of-magnitude estimate of the branching fraction for B^+ \to X
K^+ is compatible with observations provided that J/\psi \pi^+ \pi^- is a major
decay mode of the X. The branching fraction for B^0 \to X K^0 is predicted to
be suppressed by more than an order of magnitude compared to that for B^+ \to X

prospects for discovery of such an invisible Higgs, h_inv, at the LHC and the
Tevatron in three production modes: (1) in association with a Z, (2) through
Weak Boson Fusion (WBF), and (3) accompanied by a jet. In the Z+h_inv channel,
we show that the LHC can yield a discovery signal above 5 sigma with 10 fb-1 of
integrated luminosity for a Higgs mass of 120 GeV. With 30 fb-1 the discovery
reach extends up to a Higgs mass of 160 GeV. We also study the extraction of
the h_inv mass from production cross sections at the LHC, and find that
combining WBF and Z+h_inv allows a relatively model-independent determination
of the h_inv mass with an uncertainty of 35-50 GeV (15-20 GeV) with 10 (100)
fb-1. At the Tevatron, a 3 sigma observation of a 120 GeV h_inv in any single
channel is not possible with less than 12 fb-1 per detector. However, we show
that combining the signal from WBF with the previously-studied Z+h_inv channel
allows a 3 sigma observation of h_inv with 7 fb-1 per detector. Because of
overwhelming irreducible backgrounds, h_inv+j is not a useful search channel at
either the Tevatron or the LHC, despite the larger production rate.

the SU(3) symmetry breaking. Dynamical parameters of the model are fixed by
experimental data for the magnetic moments of the baryon octet as well as by
the masses of the octet, decuplet and of $\Theta^{+}$. The magnetic moment of
$\Theta^{+}$ is rather sensitive to the pion-nucleon sigma term and ranges from
$-1.19 {\rm n.m.}$ to $-0.33 {\rm n.m.}$ as the sigma term is varied from
$\Sigma_{\pi N} = 45$ to 75 MeV, respectively. On top of them, we obtained that
the strange magnetic moment of the nucleon has the value of $\mu^{(s)}_N
=+0.39$ n.m. within this scheme and turns out to be almost independent of the

system is equivalent to diffractionless scattering of the corresponding hidden
elementary excitations. This suggests that, perhaps, the key tool for finding
the spectrum of this system is neither the gauge theory's dilatation operator
nor the string sigma model's quantum Hamiltonian, but instead the respective
factorized S-matrix. To illustrate the idea, we focus on the closed fermionic
su(1|1) sector of the N=4 gauge theory. We introduce a new technique, the
perturbative asymptotic Bethe ansatz, and use it to extract this sector's
three-loop S-matrix from Beisert's involved algebraic work on the three-loop
su(2|3) sector. We then show that the current knowledge about semiclassical and
near-plane-wave quantum strings in the su(2), su(1|1) and sl(2) sectors of
AdS_5 x S^5 is fully consistent with the existence of a factorized S-matrix.
Analyzing the available information, we find an intriguing relation between the
three associated S-matrices. Assuming that the relation also holds in gauge
theory, we derive the three-loop S-matrix of the sl(2) sector even though this
sector's dilatation operator is not yet known beyond one loop. The resulting
Bethe ansatz reproduces the three-loop anomalous dimensions of twist-two
operators recently conjectured by Kotikov, Lipatov, Onishchenko and Velizhanin,
whose work is based on a highly complex QCD computation of Moch, Vermaseren and
Vogt.

number which is not a root of unity. In the classical case, a theorem of
Dixmier asserts that the simple factor algebras of the positive part U^+(g) of
the enveloping algebra of g, whose Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is equal to 2,
are isomorphic to the first Weyl algebra. In order to obtain some new quantized
analogues of the first Weyl algebra, we explicitly describe the prime and
primitive spectra of the positive part U_q^+(g) of the quantized enveloping
algebra of g and then we study the simple factor algebras of U_q^+(g) whose
Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is equal to 2. In particular, we show that the
centers of such simple factor algebras are reduced to the ground field C and we
compute their group of invertible elements. These computations suggest that we
distinguish between two families of such simple factor algebras of U_q^+(g).
The first family consists of those simple factor algebras whose group of units
is non-trivial; algebras in this first family are the so-called Weyl-Hayashi
algebras and turn out to be examples of generalized Weyl algebras over a
Laurent polynomial ring in one indeterminate. In contrast, the second family
consists of those simple factor algebras whose group of units is trivial;
algebras in this second class can not be presented as generalized Weyl algebras
over a (Laurent) polynomial ring in one indeterminate. Finally we use these
results to describe the structure of the automorphism group of U_q^+(g). More
precisely, we prove that this group is isomorphic to the torus (C^*)^2, as
conjectured by Andruskiewitsch and Dumas. As a corollary, we obtain that the
action of this group on the set of all (left) primitive ideals of U_q^+(g) has
exactly 8 orbits that we describe explicitly.

Lacs (LBLs), and 28 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). A total of 168 LECS,
MECS, and PDS spectra were analyzed, corresponding to observations taken in the
period 1996--2002. The 0.1--50 keV continuum of LBLs and FSRQs is generally
fitted by a single power law with Galactic column density. A minority of the
observations of LBLs (25%) and FSRQs (15%) is best fitted by more complex
models like the broken power law or the continuously curved parabola. These
latter models provide also the best description for half of the HBL spectra.
Complex models are more frequently required for sources with fluxes F_{2-10
keV} > 10^-11 cm-2 s-1, corresponding to spectra with higher signal-to-noise
ratio. As a result, considering sources with flux above this threshold, the
percentage of spectra requiring those models increases for all the classes. We
note that there is a net separation of X-ray spectral properties between HBLs
on one side, and LBLs and FSRQs on the other, the distinction between LBLs and
FSRQs is more blurry. This is most likely related to ambiguities in the optical
classification of the two classes.

quantitative analyses for surface contaminants or sample bulk stoichiometries,

presented. The first one yields directly the detector efficiency by measuring a
flat-background reference intensity as a function of incident x-ray flux, while
the second one determines the detector response from a least-squares analysis
of broad-scan survey spectra at different incident x-ray fluxes. Although we

decoherence in other macroscopic systems such as Bose condensates and
