(HINSA), OH, 13CO, and C18O in five dark clouds. The HINSA follows the
distribution of the emission of the carbon monoxide isotopologues, and has a
characteristic size close to that of 13CO. This confirms that the HINSA is
produced by cold HI which is well mixed with molecular gas in well-shielded
regions. The ratio of the atomic hydrogen density to total proton density for
these sources is 5 to 27 x 10^{-4}. Using cloud temperatures and the density of
HI, we set an upper limit to the cosmic ray ionization rate of 10^{-16} s^{-1}.
Comparison of observed and modeled fractional HI abundances indicates ages for
these clouds to be 10^{6.5} to 10^{7} yr. The low values of the HI density we
have determined make it certain that the time scale for evolution from an
atomic to an almost entirely molecular phase, must be a minimum of several
million years. This clearly sets a lower limit to the overall time scale for
star formation and the lifetime of molecular clouds.

parallaxes, literature radial velocities and HIPPARCOS proper motions, together

calculation of the actual velocity vectors and the orbits of the RHB stars. The
velocity characteristics are used to define a halo population sample (HPS) in
the collection of RHBs. The orbits lead statistically to an overall z-distance
probability distribution, showing that the RHBs exhibit two populations, a disk
one having a scale height of h_disk ~0.6 kpc and a halo one of ~4 kpc. We have
investigated the influence on our results of parallax accuracy and of a
demarcation line in the HRD between the RHB and the red-giant (RG) star region.
Neither of them show marked effects. We have performed the orbit analysis using
the potential model of Allen & Santillan as well as of Dehnen & Binney. The
results differ only slightly for the disk population, showing that these
potential models are not a critical part of such orbit investigations. RHB
scale height values are smaller than those found earlier for sdB stars, most
likely because the samples of stars used had different spatial distributions a
priori. The data do not allow us to specify a trend in the kinematic behaviour
of star types along the horizontal branch.

Azimuthally averaged radial spectral profiles suggest that the cluster is
isothermal to a radius of at least 160 kpc, with no evidence of a central
cooling region. Spectral mapping shows some significant temperature and
abundance substructure, but no evidence of strong cooling in the cluster core.
Abundance increases in the core, but not to the extent expected, and we find
some indication of gas mixing. Modeling the three dimensional properties of the
system, we show that ongoing heating by an AGN in the dominant elliptical, NGC
6051, is likely to be responsible for the lack of cooling. We also compare AWM
4 to MKW 4, a cluster of similar mass observed recently with XMM. While the two
systems have similar gravitational mass profiles, MKW 4 has a cool core and
somewhat steeper gas density profile, which leads to a lower core entropy. AWM
4 has a considerably larger gas fraction at 0.1 R200, and we show that these
differences result from the difference in mass between the two dominant
galaxies and the activity cycles of their AGN. We estimate the energy required
to raise the temperature profile of MKW 4 to match that of AWM 4 to be 9x10^58
erg, or 3x10^43 erg/s for 100 Myr, comparable to the likely power output of the

absorption in the first overtone bands during transit, based on plausible
models of the planetary atmosphere. We compare to theoretical tangent geometry
absorption spectra, computed by adding height-invariant ad hoc temperature
pertubations to the model atmosphere of Sudarsky et al., and by treating cloud
height as an adjustable parameter. We do not detect CO absorption. Our analysis
indicates a weakening similar to the case of sodium, suggesting that a general
masking mechanism is at work in the planetary atmosphere. If this masking is
provided by high clouds, our analysis defines the maximum cloud top pressure
(i.e., minimum height) as a function of the model atmospheric temperature. For
the relatively hot model used by Charbonneau et al. to interpret their sodium
detection, our CO limit requires cloud tops at or above 3.3 mbar, and these
clouds must be opaque at a wavelength of 2 microns. High clouds comprised of
submicron-sized particles are already present in some models, but may not
provide sufficient opacity to account for our CO result. Cooler model
atmospheres, having smaller atmospheric scale heights and lower CO mixing
ratios, may alleviate this problem to some extent. However, even models 500K
cooler that the Sudarsky et al. model require clouds above the 100 mbar level
to be consistent with our observations. Our null result therefore requires that
clouds exist at an observable level in the atmosphere of HD 209458b, unless
this planet is dramatically colder than current belief.

of the disk and can be used to constrain the physical properties of this
material. For three of the sources observed, the infrared emission is clearly
resolved. We first use geometric models to characterize the emission region
size, which ranges from 0.04 to 0.3 AU in radius. We then use Monte Carlo
radiation transfer models of accretion disks to jointly model the spectral
energy distribution and the interferometric observations with disk models
including accretion and scattering. With these models, we are able to reproduce
the data set with extended emission arising from structures larger than 10
milliarcseconds contributing less than 6% of the K band emission, consistent
with there being little or no envelope remaining for these Class II sources (d
log(lambda*F_lambda)/d log(lambda) ~ -2 to 0 in the infrared). The radiation
transfer models have inner radii for the dust similar to the geometric models;
however, for RY Tau emission from gas within the inner dust radius contributes
significantly to the model flux and visibility at infrared wavelengths. The
main conclusion of our modeling is that emission from inner gas disks (between
the magnetic truncation radius and the dust destruction radius) can be a
significant component in the inner disk flux for sources with large inner dust

triaxial dark matter haloes and their intrinsic alignments. As a direct
application we derive general expressions for the power spectrum. This we
calculate for two different triaxial density profiles. The first is a toy-model
that allows us to isolate the dependence of clustering on halo shape alone and
the second is the more realistic model of Jing & Suto (2002). In both cases, we
find that the effects of triaxiality are manifest as a suppression of power at
the level of ~5% on scales k~1-10 h/Mpc. When considered by mass, we find that
for the first model the power is suppressed and that this is more significant
for high mass haloes. For the Jing & Suto model, we find a similar suppression
on large scales, but followed by a sharp amplification on small scales at the
level of ~10-15%, for the highest mass haloes.
  One of the important features of our formalism is that it allows for the
self-consistent inclusion of the intrinsic alignments of haloes. The alignments
are specified through the correlation function of halo seeds. We develop a
useful toy model for this and make estimates of the alignment contribution to
the power spectrum. Further, through consideration of the case where all haloes
are perfectly aligned, we calculate the maximum contribution to the clustering
and find the hard limit of <10%.

secondary infall model (ESIM); they contain secondary perturbations and hence
random tangential and radial motions which affect the halo's evolution at it
undergoes shell-crossing and virialization. Even though the density profiles of
NFW and ESIM halos are different their phase-space density distributions are
the same: \rho/\sigma^3 ~ r^{-\alpha}, with \alpha=1.875 over ~3 decades in
radius. We use two approaches to try to explain this ``universal'' slope: (1)
The Jeans equation analysis yields many insights, however, does not answer why
\alpha=1.875. (2) The secondary infall model of the 1960's and 1970's,
augmented by ``thermal motions'' of particles does predict that halos should
have \alpha=1.875. However, this relies on assumptions of spherical symmetry
and slow accretion. While for ESIM halos these assumptions are justified, they
most certainly break down for simulated halos which forms hierarchically. We
speculate that our argument may apply to an ``on-average'' formation scenario
of halos within merger-driven numerical simulations, and thereby explain why
\alpha=1.875 for NFW halos. Thus, \rho/\sigma^3 ~ r^{-1.875} may be a generic
feature of violent relaxation.

and Belokurov, reanalysed the MACHO collaboration data and gave alternative
sets of microlensing events and an alternative optical depth to microlensing
toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Even though they examined less than
0.2% of the data they claimed that by using a neural net program they had
reliably selected a better (and smaller) set of microlensing candidates.
Estimating the optical depth from this smaller set, they claim that the MACHO
collaboration overestimated the optical depth by a significant factor and that
the MACHO microlensing experiment is consistent with lensing by known stars in
the Milky Way and LMC. As we show below, the analysis by these authors contains
several errors which render their conclusions meaningless. Their efficiency
analysis is clearly in error, and since they did not search through the entire
MACHO dataset, they do not know how many microlensing events their neural net
would find in the data or what optical depth their method would give.
Examination of their selected events suggests that their method misses low S/N
events and thus would have lower efficiency than the MACHO selection criteria.
In addition, their method is likely to give many more false positives
(non-lensing events identified as lensing). Both effects would increase their
estimated optical depth. Finally, we note that the EROS discovery that LMC
event-23 is a variable star reduces the MACHO collaboration estimates of
optical depth and Macho halo fraction by around 8%, and does open the question
of additional contamination.

core-accretion model of Pollack etal (1996) to include migration, disc
evolution and gap formation. We show that taking into account these effects can
lead to a much more rapid formation of giant planets, making it compatible with
the typical disc lifetimes inferred from observations of young circumstellar
discs. This speed up is due to the fact that migration prevents the severe
depletion of the feeding zone as observed in in situ calculations. Hence, the
growing planet is never isolated and it can reach cross-over mass on a much
shorter timescale. To illustrate the range of planets that can form in our
model, we describe a set of simulations in which we have varied some of the
initial parameters and compare the final masses and semi-major axes with those
inferred from observed extra-solar planets.

depending on the angular anisotropy of the jet and the properties of the

October 1995. During this period, the source underwent a major outburst in the
fall of 1993 when the 35-100 keV flux rose from a quiescent state of less than
16 mCrab before 17 September 1993 to a level of 1.5 Crab on 3 October and
remained approximately at this level over the next ~70 days. It then decreased
sharply to the pre-transition quiescent level of ~44 mCrab on 21 December where
it remained until 5 September 1994. During a 400-day period between 5 September
1994 and 10 October 1995, the source again underwent a series of five
transitions when the 35-100 keV flux increased to low-intensity levels of
\~200-400 mCrab. The low-state spectra were generally characterized by a power
law with spectral index of ~2. The high-state spectra on the other hand have
two components: a thermal Comptonized shape below ~200 keV with electron
temperature kTe of ~37 keV and optical depth of ~2.8, and a soft power-law tail
with photon index of ~3.4 above 200 keV that extends to ~500 keV. The softer
high-intensity spectrum and the harder low-intensity spectrum intercept at ~400
keV. The non-thermal power-law gamma-ray component seen in both the high and

is coupled to the hot and variable thermal emission source in the system. This
is similar to that seen in two other gamma-ray emitting black-hole candidates

bow shock with M=2.1+0.4-0.3. This is only the second clear example of a
substantially supersonic merger shock front in clusters. Comparison of the
X-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence
of the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interesting
experimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo
generation. The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct
parts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure
related to the shock, where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons for
subsequent turbulent re-acceleration. The radio edge may be caused by electron
acceleration by the shock. If so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slope
of 1.2 right behind the edge with quick steepening further away from the edge.
Alternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may be
explained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of pre-existing
relativistic electrons due to gas compression. In the latter model, there
should be radio emission in front of the shock with the same spectrum as that
behind it, but 10-20 times fainter. If future sensitive radio measurements do
not find such pre-shock emission, then the electrons are indeed accelerated (or
re-accelerated) by the shock, and one will be able to determine its
acceleration efficiency. We also propose a method to estimate the magnetic
field strength behind the shock, based on measuring the dependence of the radio
spectral slope upon the distance from the shock. In addition, the radio edge
provides a way to constrain the diffusion speed of the relativistic electrons.

Such a cluster can then reach within a parsec of the Galactic center before it
completely disrupts, releasing many young stars in this region. This scenario
provides a natural explanation for the presence of the young stars observed
near the Galactic center. Here we determine the initial conditions for this
scenario to work and we derive the mass distribution of cluster stars as a
function of distance from the Galactic center. For reasonable initial
conditions, we find that clusters massive enough for rapid inspiral would
include more massive stars (m >~ 30 Msun) than currently observed in the
inspiral region. We point out several possible explanations for this apparent
discrepancy.

have been recorded of both eta Carinae and the Homunculus at the FOS4 position

contaminated by nebular emission lines than ground-based observations of the
central object itself. Our observations show that the spectroscopic event is
much less pronounced at this position than when seen directly on eta Car using
HST/STIS. Assuming that the reflected spectrum is indeed latitude dependent
this indicates that the spectral changes during the event seen pole-on (FOS4)
are different from those closer to the equator (directly on the star). In
contrast to the spectrum of the star, the scattered spectrum of FOS4 always
shows pronounced P Cygni absorption with little variation across the
``spectroscopic event''. After that event an additional high-velocity
absorption component appears. The emission profile is more peaked at FOS4 and
consists of at least 3 distinct components, of which the reddest one shows the
strongest changes through the event. The data seem to be compatible with
changes in latitudinal wind structure of a single star, with or without the
help of a secondary star, or the onset of a shell ejection during the

are in general followed up to silicon burning. The yields of our non-rotating

in the light of the treatment of convection and the rate used for C12(a,g)O16.
This verifies the accuracy of our calculations and gives a safe basis for

plausible cluster members at z~1.27 down to i'=26.15 (5sigma) corresponding to
\~M*+2.5 at this redshift. From the 2-D distribution of these photometrically
selected galaxies, we newly identify seven candidates of galaxy groups or
clusters where the surface density of red galaxies is significantly high
(>5sigma), in addition to the two known clusters. These candidates show clear
red colour-magnitude sequences consistent with a passive evolution model, which
suggests the existence of additional high density regions around the Lynx

terms of synchrotron emission from wind-embedded shocks. The model is an
extension of an earlier one, with an improved treatment of the cooling of
relativistic electrons. This improvement limits the synchrotron-emitting volume
to a series of fairly narrow layers behind the shocks. We show that the width
of these layers increases with increasing wavelength, which has important
consequences for the shape of the spectrum. We also show that the strongest
shocks produce the bulk of the emission, so that the emergent radio flux can be
adequately described as coming from a small number of shocks, or even from a
single shock.
  A single shock model is completely determined by four parameters: the
position of the shock, the compression ratio and velocity jump of the shock,
and the surface magnetic field. Applying a single shock model to the O5 If star
Cyg OB2 No. 9 allows a good determination of the compression ratio and shock
position and, to a lesser extent, the magnetic field and velocity jump.
  Our main conclusion is that strong shocks need to survive out to distances of
a few hundred stellar radii. Even with multiple shocks, the shocks needed to
explain the observed emission are stronger than predictions from time-dependent
hydrodynamical simulations.

molecular clouds, powering a shock at the interface where protons and electrons
accelerate to relativistic energies. A viable mechanism for the emission of
gamma$-rays in these sources is the decay of neutral pions created in
collisions between the relativistic hadrons and protons in the ambient medium.
But neutral pion decay alone cannot reproduce the whole high-energy spectrum,
particularly below 100 MeV. A pion-decay scenario thus requires a lepton
population to ""fill in"" the lower part of the spectrum via bremsstrahlung
emission. This population, however, is constrained by the SNR radio spectrum.
Taking our cue from the behavior of Sgr A East, an energetic EGRET SNR at the
Galactic center, we here examine the role played in these sources by secondary
leptons--electrons and positrons produced in proton-proton scattering events
and the ensuing particle cascades. We show that while secondary leptons cannot
account for the gamma-rays below 100 MeV, they can account for the hard radio
spectra observed from the EGRET SNR's. Thus, it appears that both primary and
secondary leptons may be important contributors to the overall broadband
emission from these sources, but if so, must radiate most of their energy in
different parts of the SNR-cloud environment. We show that shock acceleration
in dense cores being overtaken by the expanding SNR shell can naturally lead to
such a scenario.

comes from the spectacular synchrotron radio emission diffused over Mpc scale
observed in a growing number of massive clusters. A promising possibility to
explain giant radio halos is given by the presence of relativistic electrons
reaccelerated by some kind of turbulence generated in the cluster volume during
merger events. With the aim to investigate the connection between thermal and
non-thermal properties of the ICM, in this paper we develope a statistical
magneto-turbulent model which describes in a self-consistent way the evolution
of the thermal ICM and that of the non-thermal emission from clusters. Making
use of the extended Press & Schechter formalism, we follow cluster mergers and
estimate the injection rate of the fluid turbulence generated during these
energetic events. We then calculate the evolution of the spectrum of the
relativistic electrons in the ICM during the cluster life by taking into
account both the electron-acceleration due to the merger-driven turbulence and
the relevant energy losses of the electrons. We end up with a synthetic
population of galaxy clusters for which the evolution of the ICM and of the
non-thermal spectrum emitted by the accelerated electrons is calculated. The
generation of detectable non-thermal radio and hard X-ray emission in the
simulated clusters is found to be possible during major merger events for
reliable values of the model parameters. In addition the occurrence of radio
halos as a function of the mass of the parent clusters is calculated and
compared with observations. In this case it is found that the model
expectations are in good agreement with observations.

counterparts, out of a total of 122 X-ray sources present in the area with
S(0.5-8 kev)>10^(-15) erg/cm^2/s. We have constructed SEDs for each source
using data from the 4 IRAC wavebands, Chandra fluxes, and optical follow-up
data in the wavebands U, g', r', i', Z, and H. We fit a number of spectral
templates to the SEDs at optical and infrared wavelengths to determine
photometric redshifts and spectral categories, and also make use of diagnostics
based on the X-ray luminosities, hardness ratios, X-ray to infrared spectral
slopes and optical morphologies. Although we have spectroscopic redshifts for
only a minority of the Chandra sources, the available SEDs constrain the
redshifts for most of the sample sources, which turn out to be typically at
0.5<z<2. We find that 39% of the Chandra sources are dominated by type-1 AGN
emission, 23% display optical/IR spectra typical of type-2 AGNs, while the
remaining 38% fraction show starburst-like or even normal galaxy spectra. Since
we prove that all these galaxies are dominated by AGN emission in X-rays this
brings the fraction of type-1 AGNs to be 80% of the type-2: even assuming that
all the Chandra sources undetected by Spitzer are type-2 AGNs, the type-1

of RAN is a little slower than the logarithm of the number of nodes in RAN.
Since most real-life networks are both scale-free and small-world networks, RAN
may perform well in mimicking the reality. The RAN possess hierarchical
structure as $C(k)\sim k^{-1}$ that in accord with the observations of many
real-life networks. In addition, we prove that RAN are maximal planar networks,
which are of particular practicability for layout of printed circuits and so
on. The percolation and epidemic spreading process are also studies and the
comparison between RAN and Barab\'{a}si-Albert(BA) as well as Newman-Watts(NW)

of nodes) is relatively small(as $N\sim 10^4$), the performance of RAN under
intentional attack is not sensitive to $N$, while that of BA networks is much
affected by $N$. And the diseases spread slower in RAN than BA networks during
the outbreaks, indicating that the large clustering coefficient may slower the
spreading velocity especially in the outbreaks.

a Fourier expansion for the order parameter and the Green's functions to handle
the quasiclassical equations in the vicinity of the transition. We show that,
below the tricritical point, the transition is always first order. We find
that, at the transition, the higher Fourier components in the order parameter
are always essentially negligible. Below the tricritical point we have the
already known result that the order parameter has a spatial dependence which is
essentially $\cos({\bf q}.{\bf r})$. However when the temperature is lowered,
the order parameter switches to a sum of two cosines, with equal weigths and
wavevector with the same length, but orthogonal directions. Finally by further
lowering the temperature, and down to T=0, one finds a another transition
toward an order parameter which is the sum of three cosines with again equal
weigths and orthogonal directions. Hence the structure of the order parameter
gets more complex as the temperature is lowered. On the other hand the
resulting critical temperatures are found to be only slightly higher than the
ones corresponding to the standard second order FFLO transition. We apply our
results to the specific case of ultracold Fermi gases and show that the
differences in atomic populations of the two hyperfine states involved in the
BCS condensation display sizeable variations when one goes from the normal
state to the superfluid FFLO phases, or one FFLO phase to another.
Experimentally this should allow to identify clearly the various phase

HST equations govern both a slow variation of the hydrodynamic variables due to
dissipation related to the vortex tangle and fast processes of the first and
second sound propagation. This circumstance prevents effective numerical
simulations of the problems of unsteady heat transfer in HeII. By virtue of a
pertinent multi-scale perturbation analysis we show how one can eliminate the
fast processes to derive the evolution equation for the slow processes only. We
then demonstrate that the long-term evolution of a transient heat load of
moderate intensity obeys the nonlinear heat conductivity equation. The second

nonstationary behavior of vortex tangle, just by monitoring of the quality

HCP sites on Cu(111) is studied using the EAM potential derived by Mishin {\it

straight (with close-packed edges) steps with (100) and (111)-type microfacets
(resp. step A and step B) are first investigated using the transition state
theory in the harmonic approximation. It is found that the classical limit
beyond which the diffusion rates follow an Arrhenius law is reached above the
Debye temperature. The Vineyard attempt frequencies and the (static) energy
barriers are reported. Then a comparison is made with the results of more
realistic classical molecular dynamic simulations which also exhibit an
Arrhenius-like behavior. It is concluded that the corresponding energy barriers
are completely consistent with the static ones within the statistical errors
and that the diffusion barrier along step B is significantly larger than along
step A. In contrast the prefactors are very different from the Vineyard
frequencies. They increase with the static energy barrier in agreement with the
Meyer-Neldel compensation rule and this increase is well approximated by the
law proposed by Boisvert {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 75} 469 (1995)].
As a consequence, the remaining part of this work is devoted to the
determination of static energy barriers for a large number of diffusion events
that can occur in the presence of an adisland. In particular, it is found that
the corner crossing diffusion process for triangular adislands is markedly
different for the two types of borders (A or B). From this set of results the
diffusion rates of the most important atomic displacements can be predicted and
used as input in Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations.

existing algorithms have been used to find community structure, one involving
removing edges with high betweenness, the other involving optimization of the
modularity. The definition of the modularity has been refined, making it more
appropriate for networks such as these where multiple edges and
self-connections are not included. The optimization algorithm has also been
improved, using Monte Carlo methods with simulated annealing and basin hopping,
both often used successfully in other optimization problems. In addition to the
small clusters, two examples with known heterogeneous landscapes, LJ_13 with
one labelled atom and LJ_38, were studied with this approach. The network
methods found communities that are comparable to those expected from landscape
analyses. This is particularly interesting since the network model does not
take any barrier heights or energies of minima into account. For comparison,
the network associated with a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice is also studied
and is found to have high modularity, thus raising some questions about the
interpretation of the community structure associated with such partitions.

Measurements have been performed on four polycrystalline samples and four
single crystals, allowing us to compare and extract the essence of dielectric
response in the material. High frequency dielectric function is found to be 30,
as expected for the perovskite material. Dielectric relaxation is found in
frequency window of 20Hz-1MHz at temperatures of 50-200K that yields to
colossal low-frequency dielectric function, i.e. static dielectric constant.
Static dielectric constant is always colossal, but varies considerably in
different samples from 1000 until 100000. The measured data can be simulated
very well by blocking (surface barrier) capacitance in series with sample
resistance. This indicates that the large dielectric constant in PCMO arises
from the Schottky barriers at electrical contacts. Measurements in magnetic
field and with d.c. bias support this interpretation. Weak anomaly at the
charge ordering temperature can also be attributed to interplay of sample and
contact resistance. We comment our results in the framework of related studies
by other groups.

achieving a significant fraction of the outage mutual information of a
multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) wireless communication system for the
case of four transmit and one receive antennas was proposed. We generalize
these results to $n_T=2^n$ transmit and an arbitrary number of receive antennas
$n_R$. Furthermore, we completely characterize the structure of the equivalent
channel for the general case and show that for all $n_T=2^n$ and $n_R$ the
eigenvectors of the equivalent channel are fixed and independent from the
channel realization. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of the equivalent channel are
independent identically distributed random variables each following a
noncentral chi-square distribution with $4n_R$ degrees of freedom.
  Based on these important insights into the structure of the QSTBC, we derive
an analytical lower bound for the fraction of outage probability achieved with
QSTBC and show that this bound is tight for low signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)
values and also for increasing number of receive antennas. We also present an
upper bound, which is tight for high SNR values and derive analytical
expressions for the case of four transmit antennas. Finally, by utilizing the
special structure of the QSTBC we propose a new transmit strategy, which
decouples the signals transmitted from different antennas in order to detect
the symbols separately with a linear ML-detector rather than joint detection,
an up to now only known advantage of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC).

industry of shellfish aquaculture. To predict when, where and in what
quantities wild seed will be available, it is necessary to track the appearance

particularly at the species level are the Bivalvia. This difficulty arises from
the fact that fundamentally all bivalve larvae have a similar shape and colour.
Identification based on gross morphological appearance is limited by the
time-consuming nature of the microscopic examination and by the limited
availability of expertise in this field. Molecular and immunological methods
are also being studied. We describe the application of computational pattern
recognition methods to the automated identification and size analysis of

optimization, classification, and distributed control problems, among others.
In the present work we overview some models derived from the observation of
real ants, emphasizing the role played by stigmergy as distributed
communication paradigm, and we present a novel strategy to tackle unsupervised
clustering as well as data retrieval problems. The present ant clustering
system (ACLUSTER) avoids not only short-term memory based strategies, as well
as the use of several artificial ant types (using different speeds), present in
some recent approaches. Moreover and according to our knowledge, this is also
the first application of ant systems into textual document clustering.

efforts at longer term evolution. In the present work we find that,

quickly flushes out spurious gravitational radiation and relaxes to a
quasi-equilibrium state with an approximate helical symmetry corresponding to

the solar system, a galaxy, a cluster, a supercluster...? The answer requires
the solution of Einstein equation with the local source, which tends towards
the cosmological model at large distance. There is, in general, no analytic
expression for the corresponding metric, but we calculate here an expansion in
a small parameter, which allows to answer the question. First, we derive a
static expression for the pure cosmological (Friedmann-Lema\^itre) metric,
whose validity, although local, extends in a very large neighborhood of the
observer. This expression appears as the metric of an osculating de Sitter
model. Then we propose an expansion of the cosmological metric with a local
source, which is valid in a very large neighborhood of the local system. This
allows to calculate exactly the (tiny) influence of cosmology on the dynamics
of the solar system: it results that, contrary to some claims, cosmological
effects fail to account for the unexplained acceleration of the Pioneer probe
by several order of magnitudes. Our expression provide estimations of the
cosmological influence in the calculations of rotation or dispersion velocity
curves in galaxies, clusters, and any type of cosmic structure, necessary for
precise evaluations of dark matter and/or cosmic flows. The same metric can
also be used to estimate the influence of cosmology on gravitational optics in

linear collider operating at centre-of-mass energies from 1 TeV to 5 TeV with
luminosity of the order of 10^35 cm^-2 s^-1. First, the CLIC collider complex
is surveyed, with emphasis on aspects related to its physics capabilities,
particularly the luminosity and energy, and also possible polarization,
\gamma\gamma and e-e- collisions. The next CLIC Test facility, CTF3, and its
R&D programme are also reviewed. We then discuss aspects of experimentation at
CLIC, including backgrounds and experimental conditions, and present a
conceptual detector design used in the physics analyses, most of which use the
nominal CLIC centre-of-mass energy of 3 TeV. CLIC contributions to Higgs
physics could include completing the profile of a light Higgs boson by
measuring rare decays and reconstructing the Higgs potential, or discovering
one or more heavy Higgs bosons, or probing CP violation in the Higgs sector.
Turning to physics beyond the Standard Model, CLIC might be able to complete
the supersymmetric spectrum and make more precise measurements of sparticles
detected previously at the LHC or a lower-energy linear e+e- collider:
\gamma\gamma collisions and polarization would be particularly useful for these
tasks. CLIC would also have unique capabilities for probing other possible
extensions of the Standard Model, such as theories with extra dimensions or new
vector resonances, new contact interactions and models with strong WW
scattering at high energies. In all the scenarios we have studied, CLIC would
provide significant fundamental physics information beyond that available from
the LHC and a lower-energy linear e+e- collider, as a result of its unique
combination of high energy and experimental precision.

that if the amplitudes of these decays are dominated by the scalar and

large tan(beta), the CP asymmetries depend practically on only one CP violating

real Minkowski $\bf M^4$, the N=2 supersymmetry is partially broken and string
acquires the open ends. Orientifolding this string, we identify the chiral and

harmonics are constructed, which are a generalizations of previous monopole
harmonics obtained by Wu and Yang(1976 {\it Nucl. Phys. B} {\bf 107} 365)

lifespan, by analyzing binomial trees. It is considerably more challenging to
make the decision for American put options with long lifespan. In order to
provide a satisfactory analysis, we look at the corresponding free boundary

the two decisions, to exercise or not to -- has an asymptotic expansion, where
the coefficient of the main term is expressed as an integral in terms of the
free boundary. This raises the perspective that one could use numerical

variables for the gyrostat practically coincide with elliptic coordinates on
sphere for the Clebsch case. Equivalence of considered integrable systems
allows to construct two Lax matrices for the gyrostat using known rational and
elliptic Lax matrices for the Clebsch model. Associated with these matrices
solutions of the Clebsch system and, therefore, of the Kowalevski gyrostat

frequency of the atomic intercombination 1S0--3P1 transition. Simple resonant
scattering theory, illustrated by the example of 40Ca, allows an estimate of
the magnitude of the effect. Unlike alkali metal species, large changes of the
scattering length are possible while atom loss remains small, because of the
very narrow line width of the molecular photoassociation transition. This
raises prospects for control of atomic interactions for a system without
magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance levels.

Monte Carlo reconstruction (F3DMC), in terms of spatial resolution and

assess the effect of noise and modeling errors on the reliability of F3DMC, to
propose and evaluate strategies for reducing the noise in the projector, and to
demonstrate the feasibility of F3DMC for a dataset with realistic dimensions. A
small cubic phantom and a realistic Jaszczak phantom dataset were considered.
Projections and projectors for both phantoms were calculated using the Monte
Carlo simulation code GATE. Projectors with different statistics were
considered and two methods for reducing noise in the projector were
investigated: one based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the other
consisting in setting small probability values to zero. Energy and spatial
shifts in projection sampling with respect to projector sampling were also
introduced to test F3DMC in realistic conditions. Experiments with the cubic
phantom showed the importance of using simulations with high statistics for
calculating the projector, and the value of filtering the projector using a PCA
approach. F3DMC was shown to be robust with respect to energy shift and small
spatial sampling off-set between the projector and the projections. Images of
the Jaszczak phantom were successfully reconstructed and also showed promising
results in terms of spatial resolution recovery and quantitative accuracy in
small structures. It is concluded that the promising results of F3DMC hold on
realistic data sets

using a Go-like model with a realistic contact map and Lennard-Jones contact
interactions. It is shown that this simple model captures the experimentally
observed difference between the two proteins: titin is a spring that is tough
and strong whereas calmodulin acts like a weak spring with featureless
force-displacement curves. The difference is related to the dominance of the
alpha secondary structures in the native structure of calmodulin. The tandem
arrangements of calmodulin unwind simultaneously in each domain whereas the
domains in titin unravel in a serial fashion. The sequences of contact events
during unraveling are correlated with the contact order, i.e. with the
separation between contact making amino acids along the backbone in the native
state. Temperature is found to affect stretching in a profound way.

Now, these properties have allowed us to build a Genetic Code ring isomorphic
to the ring (Z64, +,*) of the integer module 64. On the Z64-algebra of the set
of 64^N codon sequences of length N, gene mutations are described by means of
endomorphisms F: (Z64)^N->(Z64)^N. Endomorphisms and automorphisms helped us
describe the gene mutation pathways. For instance, 77.7% mutations in 749 HIV
protease gene sequences correspond to unique diagonal endomorphisms of the wild
type strain HXB2. In particular, most of the reported mutations that confer
drug resistance to the HIV protease gene correspond to diagonal automorphisms
of the wild type. What is more, in the human beta-globin gene a similar
situation appears where most of the single codon mutations correspond to
automorphisms. Hence, in the analyses of molecular evolution process on the DNA
sequence set of length N, the Z64-algebra will help us explain the quantitative
relationships between genes.

paper we define two dual Boolean codon lattices of the genetic code using

The Boolean lattices reflect the role of hydrophobicity in the distribution of
codon assignments to each amino acid. Particularly, the symmetric images of
codons with adenine as second base coding to hydrophilic amino acids are always
codons with uracil as second base coding to hydrophobic amino acids as they
represented in the Hasse diagrams. The Hamming distance between two codons in
the Hasse diagram reflects the different hydrophobicities between their
respective coded amino acids. Our experiments have demonstrated a small Hamming
distance to the wild type HXB2 of almost all the drug-resistant reported
mutations in HIV protease gene. The human beta-globin mutant genes have also
exhibited similar results. Our research suggests that the Hamming distance

of the two coordinates and the corresponding coarse-grained velocities cannot

past, but do not interact in the present. Three factors are crucial for the
effect: 1) separation of time-scales of coordinate and momentum which motivates
the definition of coarse-grained velocities; 2) the resulting uncertainty
relations between the coordinate of the brownian particle and the change of its
coarse-grained velocity; 3) the fact that the coarse-grained velocity, though
pertaining to a single brownian particle, is defined on a common context of two
particles. The brownian entanglement is a consequence of a coarse-grained
description and disappears for a finer resolution of the brownian motion. We
discuss possibilities of its experimental realizations in examples of

interaction, the ratio of emission and absorption probabilities is
exponentially small and is described by the Unruh factor. In the opposite case
of sharp cavity boundaries the above ratio is much greater and radiation is
produced with an intensity which can exceed the intensity of Unruh acceleration
radiation in free space by many orders of magnitude. In both cases real photons
are produced, contrary to the opinion that a uniformly accelerated atom does
not radiate. The cavity field at steady state is described by a thermal density
matrix. However, under some conditions laser gain is possible. We present a
detailed discussion of how the acceleration of atoms affects the generated
cavity field in different situations, progressing from a simple physical

standard approach to the collisional part is well-known from the literature. It
preserves hermiticity and normalization, but the question whether it preserves
