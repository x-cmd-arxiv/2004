orthogonal, constraints on the mass distribution of early-type lens galaxies.
This allows the luminous and dark-matter distribution in higher-redshift
(z>0.1) galaxies to be studied beyond the limitations of each individual
method. Two surveys have been initiated to compile a large sample of early-type
galaxies suitable to lensing and dynamical studies: (1) The Lenses Structure &
Dynamics (LSD) Survey and (2) the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. Using
spherically symmetric mass models, I illustrated how lensing and dynamical
constraints can be used to measure the ``effective'' density slope (gamma') of
galaxies inside their Einstein radii and estimate the typical error on this
determination. The main results from the LSD survey thus far are: (i) Massive
(typically >L_*) early-type galaxies at z=0.5-1 contain a significant fraction
f_CDM=0.4-0.7 of dark matter inside their Einstein radii. [The null-hypothesis,
f_CDM=0, is excluded at the >99% in all analyzed systems.] (ii) The inner CDM
density slope is gamma_CDM=1.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3} (68% CL). (iii) The total density
slope gamma' = 1.9 +- 0.1 (with 0.3 rms scatter in the sample). The intrinsic
scatter of 15% in gamma' is consistent with local dynamical studies and can
lead to a 30% rms scatter in inferred values of H_0 from lens time-delays, when
purely isothermal mass models are assumed. Hence, the common practice to assume
that lens galaxies are perfectly isothermal should be abandoned, especially in
cases where this assumption is critical.

3-30 arcmin angular sensitivity range allows the study of scales appropriate
for CMB Polarization (CMBP) investigations. The angular behavior of the diffuse
emission is analysed through the E- and B-mode power spectra. These follow a
power law $C^X_l \propto l^{\beta_X}$ with slopes \beta_E = -1.97 \pm 0.08 and
\beta_B = -1.98 \pm 0.07. The emission is found to be about a factor 25 fainter
than in Galactic plane regions. The comparison of the power spectra with other
surveys indicates that this area is intermediate between strong and negligible
Faraday rotation effects. A similar conclusion can be reached by analysing both
the frequency and Galactic latitude behaviors of the diffuse Galactic emission
of the 408-1411 MHz Leiden survey data. We present an analysis of the Faraday
rotation effects on the polarized power spectra, and find that the observed
power spectra can be enhanced by a transfer of power from large to small
angular scales. The extrapolation of the spectra to 32 and 90GHz of the CMB
window suggests that Galactic synchrotron emission leaves the CMBP E-mode
uncontaminated at 32GHz. The level of the contamination at 90GHz is expected to
be more than 4 orders of magnitude below the CMBP spectrum. Extrapolating to
the relevant angular scales, this region also appears adequate for

J094531-242831, hereafter J0945-2428, exhibits strong narrow (v < 1500km/s)
emission lines, has a resolved host galaxy, and is undetected to a radio
flux-density limit of S_{5GHz} = 0.15 mJy (3 sigma). All of these lead us to
believe that J0945-2428 is a bona fide type-II quasar.
  The luminosity of the narrow-emission lines in this object suggest that the
intrinsic power of the central engine is similar to that found in powerful
radio galaxies, indicative of similarly large supermassive black hole of ~3 x
10^8 M_solar (assuming that it is accreting at its Eddington limit). However,
from near-infrared imaging observations we find that the old stellar population
in the host galaxy has a luminosity of ~0.2 L*, mildly inconsistent with the
correlation between black-hole mass and bulge luminosity found locally,
although the uncertainty in the black-hole mass estimate is large.
  This discovery highlights the power that integral-field units have in
discovering hidden populations of objects, particularly the sought after
type-II quasars which are invoked to explain the hard X-ray background. As
such, future large integral-field surveys could open up a new window on the

collapse in general relativity have been done using approximations of the
Einstein field equations. As recently shown by Dimmelmeier et al (2002a,b), one
of the most interesting such approximation is the so-called conformal flatness
condition (CFC) of Isenberg, Wilson and Mathews. Building on this previous work
we present here new results from numerical simulations of relativistic
rotational core collapse in axisymmetry, aiming at improving the dynamics and
the gravitational waveforms. The computer code used for these simulations
evolves the coupled system of metric and fluid equations using the 3+1
formalism, specialized to a new framework for the gravitational field equations
which we call CFC+. In this approach we add new degrees of freedom to the
original CFC equations, which extend them by terms of second post-Newtonian
order. The corrections for CFC+ are computed solving a system of elliptic
linear equations. The new formalism is assessed with time evolutions of both
rotating neutron stars in equilibrium and gravitational core collapse of
rotating polytropes. Gravitational wave signals for a comprehensive sample of
collapse models are extracted using either the quadrupole formula or directly
from the metric. We discuss our results on the dynamics and the gravitational
wave emission through a detailed comparison between CFC and CFC+ simulations.
The main conclusion is that, for the neutron star spacetimes analyzed in the
present work, no significant differences are found among CFC, CFC+, and full
general relativity, which highlights the suitability of the former.

  18",,"10.1002/3527608966.ch6",,"astro-ph",,"  A review of gravitational and hydrodynamical processes during formation of
clusters and evolution of galaxies is given. Early, at the advent of N-body
computer simulations, the importance of tidal fields in galaxy encounters has
been recognized. Orbits are crowded due to tides along spiral arms, where the
star formation is enhanced. Low relative velocity encounters lead to galaxy
mergers. The central dominating galaxies in future clusters form before the
clusters in a merging process in galaxy groups. Galaxy clusters are composed in
a hierarchical scenario due to relaxation processes between galaxies and galaxy
groups. As soon as the overall cluster gravitational potential is built, high
speed galaxy versus galaxy encounters start to play a role. These harassment
events gradually thicken and shorten spiral galaxy disks leading to the
formation of S0 galaxies and ellipticals. Another aspect of the high speed
motion in the hot and diluted Intracluster Medium (ICM) is the ram pressure
exerted on the Interstellar Matter (ISM) leading to stripping of the ISM from
parent spirals. The combinations of tides and ram pressure stripping
efficiently removes the gas from spirals, quenching the star formation in
galactic disks, while triggering it in the tidal arms and at the leading edge
of gaseous disk. Gas stripping from disks transports the metals to the ICM. In
some cases, the gas extracted from the galactic disks becomes self-gravitating
forming tidal dwarf galaxies.

are based on a specific model, and are intended as a case study for the sort of
constraints one could hope to apply on a well-motivated model of
trans-Planckian physics. We present results for three different approaches -- a
grid search in a subset of the overall parameter space, a Fisher matrix
estimate of the likely error ellipses, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain fit to a
simulated CMB sky. As was seen in previous analyses, the likelihood space has
multiple peaks, and we show that their distribution can be reproduced via a
simple semi-analytic argument. All three methods lead to broadly similar
results. We vary 10 cosmological parameters (including two related to the
trans-Planckian terms) and show that the amplitude of the tensor perturbations
is directly correlated with the detectability of any trans-Planckian
modulation. We argue that this is likely to be true for any trans-Planckian
modulation in the paradigm of slow-roll inflation. For the specific case we
consider, we conclude that if the tensor to scalar ratio, $r \sim 0.15$, the
ratio between the inflationary Hubble scale $H$, and the scale of new physics
$M$ has to be on the order of 0.004 if the modulation is detectable at the

galaxies from the COMBO-17 survey using weak gravitational lensing. COMBO-17 is
particularly useful for this kind of investigation because it covers
observations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshifts
and spectral classification for objects with $R<24$ are derived. This allows us
to select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid any
uncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. We study
galaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalization
of either singular isothermal spheres (SIS) or Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and red
subsamples separately. We also constrain the scaling of halo mass with light.
For the NFW model, we find virial masses
$M_\mathrm{vir}^*=3.9^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}M_{\sun}$ (1-$\sigma$)
for blue and $M_\mathrm{vir}^*=7.1^{+7.1}_{-3.8}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}M_{\sun}$
for red galaxies of $L_\star=10^{10}h^{-2}L_{\sun}$, respectively. The derived
mass-to-light scaling relations suggest that the mass-to-light ratio might
decrease with increasing luminosity for blue galaxies but increase with
increasing luminosity for red galaxies. However, these differences between blue
and red galaxies are only marginally significant and both subsamples are
consistent with having the same mass-to-light ratio at all luminosities.
Finally, we compare our results to those obtained from the Red-Sequence Cluster
Survey (RCS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Taking differences in the
actual modelling into account, we find very good agreement with these surveys.

by quenching liquids into crystalline solids. This highly non-equilibrium
process often leads to polycrystalline growth patterns that are broadly termed
""spherulites"" because of their large-scale average spherical shape. Despite the
prevalence and practical importance of spherulite formation, only rather
qualitative concepts of this phenomenon exist. The present work explains the
growth and form of these fundamental condensed matter structures on the basis
of a unified field theoretic approach. Our phase field model is the first to
incorporate the essential ingredients for this type crystal growth:
anisotropies in both the surface energy and interface mobilities that are
responsible for needle-like growth, trapping of local orientational order due
to either static heterogeneities (impurities) or dynamic heterogeneities in
highly supercooled liquids, and a preferred relative grain orientation induced
by a misorientation-dependent grain boundary energy. Our calculations indicate
that the diversity of spherulite growth forms arises from a competition between
the ordering effect of discrete local crystallographic symmetries and the
randomization of the local crystallographic orientation that accompanies
crystal grain nucleation at the growth front (growth front nucleation or GFN).
The large-scale isotropy of spherulitic growth arises from the predominance of
GFN.

of exactly solvable models useful to investigate theoretical aspects related to

function V(x) and characterized by a zero-temperature relaxation determined by
entropy barriers and partial equilibration. Analytic expressions for the
effective temperature can be derived using a fluctuation theorem valid in the
aging regime without the need to solve the dynamical equations for correlations
and responses. Two classes of models are investigated in detail: the
homogeneous potential model with V(x)=(k/2p)x^{2p} (p being a positive integer)
and the wedge potential model (V(x)=k|x|) where V(x) has a singularity at the
ground state coordinate x=0. For the latter, we present some numerical
simulations that reinforce the validity of the main analytical results. GOMs
offer a conceptual framework to develop a statistical description of the

possible long-range order. This article presents a unified summary of all 11
two-dimensional uniform Archimedean lattices which include e.g. the square,
triangular and kagome lattice. We find that the ground state of the spin-1/2
Heisenberg antiferromagnet is likely to be semi-classically ordered in most
cases. However, the interplay of geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations
gives rise to a quantum paramagnetic ground state without semi-classical
long-range order on two lattices which are precisely those among the 11 uniform

limit. The first one is the famous kagome lattice where many low-lying singlet
excitations are known to arise in the spin gap. The second lattice is called
star lattice and has a clear gap to all excitations.

also discussed briefly. Furthermore, we discuss the magnetization process of
the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the 11 Archimedean lattices, focusing on
anomalies like plateaus and a magnetization jump just below the saturation

bundling, can be a very effective strategy for reducing the costs of producing,
marketing, and selling goods. In this paper, we consider a form of multi-issue
negotiation where a shop negotiates both the contents and the price of bundles
of goods with his customers. We present some key insights about, as well as a
technique for, locating mutually beneficial alternatives to the bundle
currently under negotiation. The essence of our approach lies in combining
historical sales data, condensed into aggregate knowledge, with current data
about the ongoing negotiation process, to exploit these insights. In
particular, when negotiating a given bundle of goods with a customer, the shop
analyzes the sequence of the customer's offers to determine the progress in the
negotiation process. In addition, it uses aggregate knowledge concerning
customers' valuations of goods in general. We show how the shop can use these
two sources of data to locate promising alternatives to the current bundle.
When the current negotiation's progress slows down, the shop may suggest the
most promising of those alternatives and, depending on the customer's response,
continue negotiating about the alternative bundle, or propose another
alternative. Extensive computer simulation experiments show that our approach
increases the speed with which deals are reached, as well as the number and
quality of the deals reached, as compared to a benchmark. In addition, we show
that the performance of our system is robust to a variety of changes in the
negotiation strategies employed by the customers.

programming, and planning. For the first time since the definition of the
stable model semantics, the class of logic programs for which a stable model
exists is given a syntactic characterization. This condition may have a
practical importance both for defining new algorithms for checking consistency
and computing answer sets, and for improving the existing systems. The approach
of this paper is to introduce a new canonical form (to which any logic program
can be reduced to), to focus the attention on cyclic dependencies. The
technical result is then given in terms of programs in canonical form
(canonical programs), without loss of generality. The result is based on
identifying the cycles contained in the program, showing that stable models of
the overall program are composed of stable models of suitable sub-programs,
corresponding to the cycles, and on defining the Cycle Graph. Each vertex of
this graph corresponds to one cycle, and each edge corresponds to onehandle,
which is a literal containing an atom that, occurring in both cycles, actually
determines a connection between them. In fact, the truth value of the handle in
the cycle where it appears as the head of a rule, influences the truth value of
the atoms of the cycle(s) where it occurs in the body. We can therefore
introduce the concept of a handle path, connecting different cycles. If for
every odd cycle we can find a handle path with certain properties, then the
existence of stable model is guaranteed.

(vDVZ) discontinuity when linearized over a Minkowski background. We show that
the linear brane scalar cosmological perturbations over an arbitrary
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time have a well defined limit
when the radius of transition between 4D and 5D gravity is sent to infinity
with respect to the background Hubble radius. This radius of transition plays
for the brane-induced gravity model a role equivalent to the Compton wavelength
of the graviton in a Pauli-Fierz theory, as far as the vDVZ discontinuity is
concerned. This well defined limit is shown to obey the linearized 4D
Einstein's equations whenever the Hubble factor is non vanishing. This shows
the disappearance of the vDVZ discontinuity for general FLRW background, and
extends the previously know result for maximally-symmetric space-times of non
vanishing curvature. Our reasoning is valid for matter with simple equation of
state such as a scalar field, or a perfect fluid with adiabatic perturbations,
and involves to distinguish between space-times with a vanishing scalar
curvature and space-times with a non vanishing one. We also discuss the
validity of the linear perturbation theory, in particular for those FLRW
space-times where the Ricci scalar is vanishing only on a set of zero measure.
In those cases, we argue that the linear perturbation theory breaks down when
the Ricci scalar vanishes (and the radius of transition is sent to infinity),
in a way similar to what has been found to occur around sources on a Minkowski
background.

find necessary conditions for the well posedness of the resulting
initial-boundary value problem and integrate the resulting three-dimensional
nonlinear equations using a finite-differencing code. We obtain a set of
constraint-preserving boundary conditions which pass a robust numerical
stability test. We explicitly compare these new boundary conditions to
standard, maximally dissipative ones through Brill wave evolutions. Our
numerical results explicitly show that in the latter case the constraint
variables, describing the violation of the constraints, do not converge to zero
when resolution is increased while for the new boundary conditions, the
constraint variables do decrease as resolution is increased. As an application,
we inject pulses of ``gravitational radiation'' through the boundaries of an
initially flat spacetime domain, with enough amplitude to generate strong
fields and induce large curvature scalars, showing that our boundary conditions
are robust enough to handle nonlinear dynamics.
  We expect our boundary conditions to be useful for improving the accuracy and
stability of current binary black hole and binary neutron star simulations, for

in the rational numbers Q by a formula (\forall \exists \forall \exists)(F=0)
where the \forall-quantifiers run over a total of 8 variables, and where F is a
polynomial. This implies that the \Sigma_5-theory of Q is undecidable. We prove
that a conjecture about elliptic curves provides an interpretation of Z in Q
with quantifier complexity \forall \exists, involving only one universally
quantified variable. This improves the complexity of defining Z in Q in two
ways, and implies that the \Sigma_3-theory, and even the \Pi_2-theory, of Q is
undecidable (recall that Hilbert's Tenth Problem for Q is the question whether
the \Sigma_1-theory of Q is undecidable).
  In short, granting the conjecture, there is a one-parameter family of
hypersurfaces over Q for which one cannot decide whether or not they all have a
rational point.
  The conjecture is related to properties of elliptic divisibility sequences on
an elliptic curve and its image under rational 2-descent, namely existence of
primitive divisors in suitable residue classes, and we discuss how to prove
weaker-in-density versions of the conjecture and present some heuristics.

obtain a bijective correspondence between localic etale groupoids and their

inverse quantal frames. We show that the category of inverse quantal frames is
equivalent to the category of complete and infinitely distributive inverse
monoids, and as a consequence we obtain a correspondence between these and
localic etale groupoids that generalizes more classical results concerning
inverse semigroups and topological etale groupoids. This generalization is
entirely algebraic and it is valid in an arbitrary topos. As a consequence of
these results we see that a localic groupoid is etale if and only if its
sublocale of units is open and its multiplication map is semiopen, and an
analogue of this holds for topological groupoids. In practice we are provided
with new tools for constructing localic and topological etale groupoids, as
well as inverse semigroups, for instance via presentations of quantales by
generators and relations. The characterization of inverse quantal frames is to
a large extent based on a new quantale operation, here called a support, whose
properties are thoroughly investigated, and which may be of independent

communities (microbial mats). The mats evolve over time to form internally
laminated organosedimentary structures (stromatolites). Modern day
stromatolites exist in only a few locations, whereas ancient stromatolitic
microbialites were the only form of life for much of the Earth's history. They
existed in a wide variety of growth forms, ranging from almost perfect cones to
branched columnar structures. The coniform structures are central to the heated
debate on the oldest evidence of life. We proposed a biotic model which
considers the relationship between upward growth of a phototropic or
phototactic biofilm and mineral accretion normal to the surface. These
processes are sufficient to account for the growth and form of many ancient
stromatolities. These include domical stromatolites and coniform structures
with thickened apical zones typical of Conophyton. More angular coniform
structures, similar to the stromatolites claimed as the oldest macroscopic
evidence of life, form when the photic effects dominate over mineral accretion.

ability to isolate the contribution of strange quark-antiquark pairs to the
nucleon's charge and magnetism. The SAMPLE experiment at the MIT-Bates

theory, the effort required to make a fit can be daunting due to the large
number of parameters that may be in the theory and the large number of nuclei
in the mass table. For theories based on the Skyrme interaction, the effort can
be reduced considerably by using the singular value decomposition to reduce the
size of the parameter space. We find that the sensitive parameters define a
space of dimension four or so, and within this space a linear refit is adequate
for a number of Skyrme parameters sets from the literature. We do not find
marked differences in the quality of the fit between the SLy4, the Bky4 and SkP
parameter sets. The r.m.s. residual error in even-even nuclei is about 1.5 MeV,
half the value of the liquid drop model. We also discuss an alternative norm
for evaluating mass fits, the Chebyshev norm. It focuses attention on the cases
with the largest discrepancies between theory and experiment. We show how it
works with the liquid drop model and make some applications to models based on
Skyrme energy functionals. The Chebyshev norm seems to be more sensitive to new
experimental data than the root-mean-square norm. The method also has the
advantage that candidate improvements to the theories can be assessed with
computations on smaller sets of nuclei.

electromagnetically. Here we examine the rates for electromagnetic excitation
of the isotopes of several isomers of interest both in astrophysics and applied
physics (e.g. 235U, 193Ir, and 87Y,88Y). We consider six possible
electromagnetic processes, namely, photo-absorption, inverse internal

the electromagnetic reactions rates are negligible. Thus, we conclude that

contribution is a demonstration of the special computational power of these

computing. Concretely, we show that the W-state is the only pure state that can
be used to exactly solve the problem of leader election in anonymous quantum
networks. Similarly we show that the GHZ-state is the only one that can be used
to solve the problem of distributed consensus when no classical post-processing
is considered. These results generalize to a family of W- and GHZ-like states.
At the heart of the proofs of these impossibility results lie symmetry
