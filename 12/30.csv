that the later continental mass rearrangement and their gravitational field

the near future the needed threshold and accuracy to reveal Tsunami by their

substantially increased the statistics available for these three isolated
neutron stars, so apparently similar to deserve the nickname of ""Three
Musketeers"" (Becker & Truemper, 1997). Here we shall take advantage of the EPIC
statistics to perform phase resolved spectroscopy for all three objects. The
phase-averaged spectrum of the three musketeers is best described by a three
component model. This includes two blackbody components, a cooler one, possibly
originating from the bulk of the star surface, and a hotter one, coming from a
smaller portion of the star surface (a ""hot spot""), plus a power law. The
relative contributions of the three components are seen to vary as a function
of phase, as the stars' rotation bring into view different emitting regions.
The hot spots, which have very different apparent dimensions (in spite of the
similarity of the three neutron stars polar cap radii) are responsible for the
bulk of the phase variation. The amplitude of the observed phase modulation is
also markedly different for the three sources. Another striking aspect of our
phase-resolved phenomenology is the apparent lack of any common phase
alignement between the observed modulation patterns for the two blackbody
components. They are seen to vary in phase in the case of PSR B1055-52, but in
anti-phase in the case of PSR B0656+14. These findings do not support standard
and simplistic models of neutron star magnetic field configuration and surface
temperature distribution.

even near the equator. Surprisingly, we find a temperature difference of 6+/-3
K between the East and West hemispheres of Titan at ~240 km altitude. Common
direct processes such as diurnal heating by sunlight do not adequately explain
the asymmetry, suggesting other processes, such as unknown atmospheric
dynamics, may be responsible. The origin of the temperature difference is

generally to test for periodic components against a background noise spectrum

of the significance of candidate periodic signals in short, well-sampled time

these subtle effects can lead to substantially overestimated significances.
These difficulties motivate us to demand high standards of detection (minimum

nonvanishing third and higher order terms in the relativistic analyses are
supposed to be pure relativistic corrections. In this work we derive such
correction terms appearing in the third order. Continuing our success in the
second-order perturbations we take the comoving gauge. We discover that the
third-order correction terms are of $\phi_v$-order higher than the second-order
terms where $\phi_v$ is a gauge-invariant combination related to the
three-space curvature perturbation in the comoving gauge; compared with the
Newtonian potential we have $\delta \Phi \sim {3 \over 5} \phi_v$ to the linear

higher than the Newtonian ones. The corrections terms are independent of the

perturbation strength. From the temperature anisotropy of cosmic microwave

  Bulgaria",,"SU-TH-22-04","gr-qc",,"  Utilizing various gauges of the radial coordinate we give a description of
static spherically symmetric space-times with point singularity at the center
and vacuum outside the singularity. We show that in general relativity (GR)
there exist a two-parameters family of such solutions to the Einstein equations
which are physically distinguishable but only some of them describe the
gravitational field of a single massive point particle with nonzero bare mass
$M_0$. In particular, the widespread Hilbert's form of Schwarzschild solution,
which depends only on the Keplerian mass $M<M_0$, does not solve the Einstein
equations with a massive point particle's stress-energy tensor as a source.
Novel normal coordinates for the field and a new physical class of gauges are
proposed, in this way achieving a correct description of a point mass source in
GR. We also introduce a gravitational mass defect of a point particle and
determine the dependence of the solutions on this mass defect. The result can
be described as a change of the Newton potential $\phi_{{}_N}=-G_{{}_N}M/r$ to
a modified one: $\phi_{{}_G}=-G_{{}_N}M/ (r+G_{{}_N} M/c^2\ln{{M_0}\over M})$
and a corresponding modification of the four-interval. In addition we give
invariant characteristics of the physically and geometrically different classes
of spherically symmetric static space-times created by one point mass. These
space-times are analytic manifolds with a definite singularity at the place of
the matter particle.

of freedom in a Lorentz-invariant theory. A general treatment of spontaneous
local Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation is given for various spacetimes, and
the fate of the Nambu-Goldstone modes is shown to depend on both the spacetime
geometry and the dynamics of the tensor field triggering the spontaneous
Lorentz violation. The results are illustrated within the general class of
bumblebee models involving vacuum values for a vector field. In Minkowski and
Riemann spacetimes, the bumblebee model provides a dynamical theory generating
a photon as a Nambu-Goldstone boson for spontaneous Lorentz violation. The
Maxwell and Einstein-Maxwell actions are automatically recovered in axial
gauge. Associated effects of potential experimental relevance include
Lorentz-violating couplings in the matter and gravitational sectors of the

differential geometry and mathematical physics -- first abelian gerbes, and
more recently nonabelian gerbes. These concepts can be elegantly understood
using the concept of `2-bundle' recently introduced by Bartels. A 2-bundle is a
generalization of a bundle in which the fibers are categories rather than sets.
Here we introduce the concept of a `2-connection' on a principal 2-bundle. We
describe principal 2-bundles with connection in terms of local data, and show
that under certain conditions this reduces to the cocycle data for nonabelian
gerbes with connection and curving subject to a certain constraint -- namely,
the vanishing of the `fake curvature', as defined by Breen and Messing. This
constraint also turns out to guarantee the existence of `2-holonomies': that
is, parallel transport over both curves and surfaces, fitting together to
define a 2-functor from the `path 2-groupoid' of the base space to the
structure 2-group. We give a general theory of 2-holonomies and show how they

is taken to be $g=2\nu (\nu-1)$ with ${1/2} <\nu< {3/2}$ and then the angular
Hamiltonian is shown to admit a 2-parameter family of inequivalent
quantizations compatible with the dihedral $D_6$ symmetry of its potential term
$9 \nu (\nu -1)/\sin^2 3\phi$. These are parametrized by a matrix $U\in U(2)$
satisfying $\sigma_1 U \sigma_1 = U$, and in all cases we describe the
qualitative features of the angular eigenvalues and classify the eigenstates
under the $D_6$ symmetry and its $S_3$ subgroup generated by the particle
exchanges. The angular eigenvalue $\lambda$ enters the radial Hamiltonian
through the potential $(\lambda -{1/4})/r^2$ allowing a 1-parameter family of
self-adjoint boundary conditions at $r=0$ if $\lambda <1$. For $0<\lambda<1$
our analysis of the radial Schr\""odinger equation is consistent with previous
results on the possible energy spectra, while for $\lambda <0$ it shows that
the energy is not bounded from below rejecting those $U$'s admitting such
eigenvalues as physically impermissible. The permissible self-adjoint angular
Hamiltonians include, for example, the cases $U=\pm {\bf 1}_2, \pm \sigma_1$,
which are explicitly solvable and are presented in detail. The choice $U=-{\bf
1}_2$ reproduces Calogero's quantization, while for the choice $U=\sigma_1$ the
system is smoothly connected to the harmonic oscillator in the limit $\nu \to

mechanical loads, how to define the initial geometry so that the deformed one
matches precisely a prescribed shape?'' This question is particularly relevant
in forming processes where the tolerated mismatch between the deformed and

a first ``guess'' to the required initial geometry the desired one, then it
updates iteratively the locations of a set of boundary points so that their
locations in the deformed configuration come closer and closer to the desired
ones. The scheme is shown to converge unconditionally for small deformations in
the sense that arbitrarily small mismatch between the deformed and desired
shape can be achieved. Moreover, since it is based entirely on geometric
considerations, the convergence should not be affected by the nature of
material, i.e. it is independent of the constitutive law. The success of the
method is illustrated by considering an example.

Configuration interaction study gives E_eff=0.336\times 10^{24}Hz/e*cm (our
final value). The structure of chemical bonding and contributions to E_eff in
HI$^+$ is clarified and significant deviation of our value from that obtained
in Ravaine etal Phys.Rev.Lett., 94, 013001 (2005) is explained.

40, 7193 (1989)] in the context of a regularization of the Chapman-Enskog
expansion. We are able to prove that shock waves appear in finite time in
Rosenau's extended Burgers' equation, and we discuss the physical implications
of this fact and its connection with a possible extension of hydrodynamics to
the short wavelength domain.

proteins is presented. VER of a selected mode in cytochrome c is studied using
two theoretical approaches. One is the equilibrium simulation approach with
quantum correction factors, and the other is the reduced model approach which
describes the protein as an ensemble of normal modes interacting through
nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in estimates of the VER time
(sub ps) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room temperature. The
theoretical predictions are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's
group. A perspective on future directions for the detailed study of time scales
and mechanisms for VER in proteins is presented.

can protect a population from hostile external conditions, the so called
critical patch size problem. We analize both cases in which the particles are
considered fermions and bosons and show using exact analitical methods that,
while the Fermi-Dirac statistics leads to certain extinction for any refuge
size, the Bose-Eistein statistics allows survival even for the minimal refuge.

that the particular physiology of the mesenchymal cells allows one-dimensional

morphogenesis represents thus a more complex type of pattern formation than
those found in bacterial colonies. We finally compare our theoretical
predictions with recent in vitro experiments.
