the features expected from Dark Matter WIMP Annihilation: a)it is present and
has the same spectrum in all sky directions, not just in the galactic plane. b)
The intensity of the excess shows the $1/r^2$ profile expected for a flat
rotation curve outside the galactic disc with additionally an interesting
substructure in the disc in the form of a doughnut shaped ring at 14 kpc from
the centre of the galaxy. At this radius a ring of stars indicates the probable
infall of a dwarf galaxy, which can explain the increase in DM density.
  From the spectral shape of the excess the WIMP mass is estimated to be
between 50 and 100 GeV, while from the intensity the halo profile is
reconstructed. Given the mass and intensity of the WIMP's the mass of the ring
can be calculated, which is shown to explain the peculiar change of slope in
the rotation curve at about 11 kpc. These signals of Dark Matter Annihilation
are compatible with Supersymmetry and have a statistical significance of more
than 10 stnadard deviations in comparison with a fit of the conventional
galactic model to the EGRET data. The statistical significance combined with
all features mentioned above provide an intriguing hint that the EGRET excess
is indeed a signal from Dark Matter Annihilation.

filamentary structure oriented in the NW-SE direction, shows clear
morphological differences for each molecule. We find that HCO+ has an extremely
high optical depth, and that the H13CO+ emission is well correlated with submm
sources. The BIMA and FCRAO combined maps recover emission from a lot of other

an overall aspect of a filamentary structure connecting several intense clumps.
We found a total 15 clumps in our combined data cube, all of them resolved by
our angular resolution, with diameters in the 0.03-0.09 pc range. We find a
clear segregation between the northern and southern region of the map: the
northern section shows the less chemically evolved gas and less massive but
more numerous clumps, while the southern region is dominated by the largest and
most massive clump, and contains the more evolved gas, as traced by emission of
late-time molecules. We find that the derived clump masses are below the virial
mass, and that the clumps masses become closer to the virial mass when they get
bigger and more massive. This supports the idea that these clumps must be
transient, and only the more massive ones have a chance to last long enough to
form stars. The clumps we detect are probably in an earlier evolutionary stage
than the ``starless cores'' reported recently in the literature. Only the most
massive one has properties similar to a ``starless core''.

one-dimensional (1D) periodic potential modulation, and of the spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) described only by the Rashba term. In the absence of the
modulation the SOI mixes the spin-up and spin-down states of neighboring Landau
levels into two new, unequally spaced energy branches. The levels of these
branches broaden into bands in the presence of the modulation and their
bandwidths oscillate with the field $B$. Evaluated at the Fermi energy, the
$n$-th level bandwidth of each series has a minimum or vanishes at different
values of the field $B$. In contrast with the 1D-modulated 2DEG without SOI,
for which only one flat-band condition applies, here there are two flat-band
conditions that can change considerably as a function of the SOI strength
$\alpha$ and accordingly influence the transport coefficients of the 2DEG. The
phase and amplitude of the Weiss and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations
depend on the strength $\alpha$. For small values of $\alpha$ both oscillations
show beating patterns. Those of the former are due to the independently
oscillating bandwidths whereas those of the latter are due to modifications of
the density of states, exhibit an even-odd filling factor transition, and are
nearly independent of the modulation strength. For strong values of $\alpha$
the SdH oscillations are split in two.

for these calculations is the Jordan-Wigner fermionization. The latter
technique being completed by the continued fraction approach permits to obtain
analytically the thermodynamic quantities for a `slightly complicated' model in
which the intersite exchange interactions and on-site fields vary regularly
along a chain. Rigorous analytical results for the ground-state and
thermodynamic quantities, as well as exact numerical data for the spin
correlations computed for long chains (up to a few thousand sites) demonstrate
how the regularly alternating bonds/fields effect the quantum phase transition.

and finally summarize emphasizing the effects of periodically modulated

requires also addressing the transverse spin distribution of quarks, or
transversity, which is yet unexplored because of its chiral-odd nature.
Transversity can be best extracted from single-spin asymmetries in fully
polarized Drell-Yan processes with antiprotons, where valence contributions are
involved anyway. Alternatively, in single-polarized Drell-Yan the transversity
happens convoluted with another chiral-odd function, which is likely to be
responsible for the well known (and yet unexplained) violation of the Lam-Tung
sum rule in the corresponding unpolarized cross section. We present Monte-Carlo
simulations for the unpolarized and single-polarized Drell-Yan $\bar{p}
p^{(\uparrow)} \to \mu^+ \mu^- X$ at different center-of-mass energies in both
configurations where the antiproton beam hits a fixed proton target or it
collides on another proton beam. The goal is to estimate the minimum number of
events needed to extract the above chiral-odd distributions from future
measurements at the HESR ring at GSI. It is important to study the feasibility
of such experiments at HESR in order to demonstrate that interesting spin
physics can be explored already using unpolarized antiprotons.

  Conference on Strings and Cosmology",,"10.1063/1.1848340",,"hep-th",,"  We provide a prescription for parametrizing the vacuum choice ambiguity in
cosmological settings. We introduce an arbitrary boundary action representing
the initial conditions. A Lagrangian description is moreover the natural
setting to study decoupling of high-energy physics. RG flow affects the
boundary interactions. As a consequence the boundary conditions are sensitive
to high-energy physics through irrelevant terms in the boundary action. Using
scalar field theory as an example, we derive the leading dimension four
irrelevant boundary operators. We discuss how the known vacuum choices, e.g.
the Bunch-Davies vacuum, appear in the Lagrangian description and square with
decoupling. For all choices of boundary conditions encoded by relevant boundary
operators, of which the known ones are a subset, backreaction is under control.
All, moreover, will generically feel the influence of high-energy physics
through irrelevant (dimension four) boundary corrections. Having established a
coherent effective field theory framework including the vacuum choice
ambiguity, we derive an explicit expression for the power spectrum of
inflationary density perturbations including the leading high energy
corrections. In accordance with the dimensionality of the leading irrelevant
operators, the effect of high energy physics is linearly proportional to the
Hubble radius H and the scale of new physics l = 1/M. Effects of such strength
are potentially observable in future measurements of the cosmic microwave

follows: Each site (vertex) of the square lattice is either vacant or occupied
by a tree.Vacant sites become occupied at rate 1. Further, each site is hit by
lightningat rate lambda. This lightning instantaneously destroys (makes vacant)
the occupied cluster of the site. This model is closely related to the
Drossel-Schwabl forest-fire model, which has received much attention in the
physics literature. The most interesting behaviour seems to occur when the
lightning rate goes to zero. In the physics literature it is believed that then
the system has so-called self-organized critical behaviour.
  We let the system start with all sites vacant and study, for positive but
small lambda,the behaviour near the `critical time' tc; that is, the time after
which in the modified system without lightning an infinite occupied cluster
would emerge.

lambda tend to 0 and m to infinity, the probability that some tree at distance
smaller than m from O is burnt before time t goes to 1. However, we show that
under a percolation-like assumption (which we can not prove but believe to be
true) this intuition is false. We compare with the case where the square

for integrable orbital motion in storage rings. Spin motion on the periodic
closed orbit of a storage ring can be analyzed in terms of the Floquet theorem
for equations of motion with periodic parameters and a spin precession
frequency emerges in a Floquet exponent as an additional frequency of the
system. To define a spin precession frequency on nonperiodic synchro-betatron
orbits we exploit the important concept of quasiperiodicity. This allows a
generalization of the Floquet theorem so that a spin precession frequency can
be defined in this case too. This frequency appears in a Floquet-like exponent
as an additional frequency in the system in analogy with the case of motion on
the closed orbit. These circumstances lead naturally to the definition of the
uniform precession rate and a definition of spin tune. A spin tune is a uniform
precession rate obtained when certain conditions are fulfilled. Having defined
spin tune we define spin-orbit resonance on synchro--betatron orbits and
examine its consequences. We give conditions for the existence of uniform
precession rates and spin tunes (e.g. where small divisors are controlled by
applying a Diophantine condition) and illustrate the various aspects of our
description with several examples. The formalism also suggests the use of
spectral analysis to ``measure'' spin tune during computer simulations of spin
motion on synchro-betatron orbits.

collective instability which spontaneously generates a periodic density
modulation in the cold atomic sample with a period equal to half of the
wavelength of the generated high-frequency optical field. Due to the generation
of this density modulation, phase-matching between the pump and scattered
fields is not a necessary initial condition for this wave-mixing process to
occur, rather the density modulation acts to ""self phase-match"" the fields
during the course of the wave-mixing process. We describe a one-dimensional
model of this process, and suggest a proof-of-principle experiment which would
involve pumping a sample of cold Cs atoms with three infra-red pump fields to
produce blue light.

setting under positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations (PPT-operations)
and obtain both qualitative and quantitative results. Firstly, for some pure
state transformations that are impossible under local operations and classical
communication (LOCC), we demonstrate that they become possible with a
surprisingly large success probability under PPT-operations. Furthermore, we
clarify the convertibility of arbitrary multipartite pure states under
PPT-operations, and show that a drastic simplification in the classification of
pure state entanglement occurs when the set of operations is switched from LOCC
to PPT-operations. Indeed, the infinitely many types of LOCC-incomparable
entanglement are reduced to only one type under the action of PPT-operations.
This is a clear manifestation of the increased power afforded by the use of
PPT-bound entanglement. In addition, we further enlarge the set of operations
to clarify the effect of another type of bound entanglement, multipartite
unlockable bound entanglement, and show that a further simplification occurs.
As compared to pure states a more complicated situation emerges in the mixed
state settings. While single copy distillation becomes possible under
PPT-operations for some mixed states it remains impossible for other mixed
states.

kinds of probability, and the relationship between them. The fundamental theory
of objective probability is quantum mechanics: it is argued that neither Bohr's
Copenhagen interpretation, nor the pilot-wave theory, nor stochastic
state-reduction theories, give a satisfactory answer to the question of what
objective probabilities are in quantum mechanics, or why they should satisfy
the Born rule; nor do they give any reason why subjective probabilities should
track objective ones.
  But it is shown that if probability only arises with decoherence, then they
must be given by the Born rule. That further, on the Everett interpretation, we
have a clear statement of what probabilities are, in terms of purely
categorical physical properties; and finally, along lines recently laid out by
Deutsch and Wallace, that there is a clear basis in the axioms of decision
theory as to why subjective probabilities should track these objective ones.
  These results hinge critically on the absence of hidden-variables or any
other mechanism (such as state-reduction) from the physical interpretation of
the theory.
  The account of probability has traditionally been considered the principal
weakness of the Everett interpretation; on the contrary it emerges as one of
its principal strengths.

and opportunistic, and based on doubtful philosophical premises. If so Bohr's
influence, in the pre-war period of 1927-1939, is the harder to explain, and
the acceptance of his approach to quantum mechanics over de Broglie's had no
reasonable foundation. But Bohr's interpretation changed little from the time
of its first appearance, and stood independent of any philosophical
presuppositions. The principle of complementarity is itself best read as a
conjecture of unusually wide scope, on the nature and future course of
explanations in the sciences (and not only the physical sciences). If it must
be judged a failure today, it is not because of any internal inconsistency.
