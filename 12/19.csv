and entangled photons from atomic cascades. The identification of a cascade
emission close to a black-hole event horizon would allow us to observe photons
entangled with partners that have fallen behind the horizon. The experiment
involves testing the characteristic cos^2(theta) modulation of photon
transmission through a pair of polarisers at relative angle theta (Malus' law).
For single photons, Malus' law is a remarkable feature of quantum theory: it is
equivalent to expectation additivity for incompatible observables, and is
generically violated for hidden-variables theories with nonstandard probability
distributions. An experiment with entangled states straddling an event horizon
is motivated by the Hawking information loss puzzle, as well as on general
grounds. In principle, one could test the currently observed X-ray photons in
iron lines from black-hole accretion discs. However, only a small fraction
(~0.6%) have cascade partners, and current X-ray polarimetry does not permit
successive measurements on a single X-ray photon. A realisable experiment
requires the identification of an appropriate cascade in a more convenient
frequency band.

of pressure and temperature on the fluid properties may be neglected. Four
different system geometries are considered: a rigid cylinder moving parallel to
a soft layer coating a rigid substrate; a soft cylinder moving parallel to a
rigid substrate; a cylindrical shell moving parallel to a rigid substrate; and
finally a cylindrical conforming journal bearing coated with a thin soft layer.
In addition, for the particular case of a soft layer coating a rigid substrate
we consider both elastic and poroelastic material responses. For all these
cases we find the same generic behavior: there is an optimal combination of
geometric and material parameters that maximizes the dimensionless normal force
as a function of the softness parameter = hydrodynamic pressure/elastic
stiffness = surface deflection/gap thickness which characterizes the
fluid-induced deformation of the interface. The corresponding cases for a
spherical slider are treated using scaling concepts.

carried out. The magnetization is shown to obey in general a non-local equation
of motion which differs from the the Gilbert equation and is extended to the
non-adiabatic regime. To lowest order in the exchange interaction and in the
limit where the Gilbert equation applies, we show that the damping term is
enhanced due to interfacial effects but it also shows oscillations as a
function of the film thickness. The noise calculation is however carried out to
all orders in the exchange coupling constant. The ellipticity of the precession
of the magnetization is taken into account. The damping is shown to have a
Gilbert form only in the adiabatic limit while the relaxation time becomes
strongly dependent on the geometry of the thin film. It is also shown that the
induced noise characteristic of sd-exchange is inherently colored in character
and depends on the symmetry of the Hamiltonian of the magnetization in the
film. We show that the sd-noise can be represented in terms of an external
stochastic field which is white only in the adiabatic regime. The temperature
is also renormalized by the spin accumulation in the system. For large
intra-atomic exchange interactions, the Gilbert-Brown equation is no longer
valid.

inelastic contribution to the current for various alkanethiols sandwiched

electrodes, we find that the local temperature of the alkanethiols is
relatively insensitive to their length. This is due to the rates of heating and
cooling processes scaling similarly with length. On the other hand, when
considering heat dissipation into the bulk electrodes, the local temperature of
alkanethiols decreases as their length increases. We also find that the
inelastic scattering profile displays an odd-even effect with length which
compares well with experimental results. This effect is due to the alternating
direction of the CH3 group motion with respect to current flow with increasing
C atoms in the chain, and is very sensitive to the structure of the
carbon-sulfur-gold bond. Inelastic scattering profiles can therefore help
illuminate the bonding configuration of molecules to metallic surfaces.

invariance of the partition function under reparametrizations of the complex

The results for the moments up to the third degree, and therefore the
implications for the distribution of primes in short intervals, are the same as
those we obtained (in the first paper with this title) by using the simpler
approximation $\Lambda_{R}(n)$. However, when $\lambda_{R}(n)$ is used the
error in the singular series approximation is often much smaller than what
$\Lambda_{R}(n)$ allows. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for
Dirichlet $L$-functions, we obtain an $\Omega_{\pm}$-result for the variation
of the error term in the prime number theorem. Formerly, our knowledge under
GRH was restricted to $\Omega$-results for the absolute value of this
variation. An important ingredient in the last part of this work is a recent
result due to Montgomery and Soundararajan which makes it possible for us to
dispense with a large error term in the evaluation of a certain singular series

of Strontium 88 atoms in one dimensional optical molasses. In our case, since
the optical cooling dipole transition involves a $J_g=0$ groundstate, no
Sisyphus-type mechanisms can occur. We are thus able to test quantitatively the
predictions of the Doppler-cooling theory. We have found, in agreement with
other similar experiments, that the measured temperatures are systematically
larger than the theoretical predictions. We quantitatively interpret this
discrepancy by taking into consideration the extra-heating mechanism induced by
transverse spatial intensity fluctuations of the optical molasses. Experimental
data are in good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations of our theoretical
model. We thus confirm the important role played by intensity fluctuations in
the dynamics of cooling and for the steady-state regime.

  measurement problem from standard Quantum Mechanics and its impact on complex
  space-time, no-boundary proposal and information loss paradox of
  singularity-free Quantum Cosmology","40 pages,5 figures",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  In order to resolve the measurement problem of Quantum Mechanics, non-unitary
time evolution has been derived from the unitarity of standard quantum
formalism. New wave functions of free and non-free quantum systems follow from
Schroedinger equation after inserting an ansatz. Quantum systems show up as
probability waves before measurement. A pure entangled state of a composite
system evolves non-unitarily, only to disentangle itself into a definite state
after reduction at the measurement point. A classical space-time point is
created momentarily in this event. Unitarity is restored at that point. The
non-Hermitian observables defined in the domain of rigged Hilbert space
transform into Hermitian ones at the measurement point. The problem of
preferred basis is resolved by the requirement of specifying the position of
measurement point. Two theorems prove that time is a non-Hermitian operator,
thus placing space and time on an equal footing. Bound states are found to need
discrete space-time, which supports its use in loop quantum gravity.
Non-unitarity in the theory helps buttress the no-boundary proposal; and
uncertainty relation makes a leeway to singularity-free Quantum Cosmology.
Quantum Mechanics also accommodates complex and negative probabilities.

the equivalence between quantum tunnelling and ""photon tunnelling"" (evanescent
waves propagation), with particular attention to tunnelling with Superluminal
group-velocities (""Hartman effect""). At last, in an Appendix, we add a bird-eye
view of all the experimental sectors of physics in which Superluminal motions
