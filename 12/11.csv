point-spread function (PSF) using stars from many exposures. The principal
components of the variation in the PSF pattern from multiple exposures are used
to solve for better fits for each individual exposure. These improved fits are
then used to correct the weak lensing shapes. Since we expect some degree of
correlation in the PSF anisotropy across exposures, using information from
stars in all exposures leads to a significant gain in the accuracy of the
estimated PSF. It means that in general, the accuracy of PSF reconstruction is
limited not by the number density of stars per exposure, but by the stacked
number density across all exposures in a given survey. This technique is
applied to the 75 square degree CTIO lensing survey, and we find that the PSF
variation is well described by a small number of components. There is a
significant improvement in the lensing measurements: the residual stellar PSF
correlations are reduced by several orders of magnitude, and the measured
B-mode in the two-point correlation is consistent with zero down to 1
arcminute. We also discuss the applications of the PCA technique to future
surveys.

unique and self-consistent set of light curves in the blue and near-infrared
bands, spanning a 15-year interval (epoch 1955-1970). Our photometric data show
clearly the beginning of the eclipse stage occurred in early 1958 in the blue,
and perhaps around four years later in the infrared. The light curve period
turns out to be the same reported by recent observations (about 48.3 days), so
that no evidence for a period change results. On the other hand, in our data
the light curve shape appears as sinusoidal and is therefore different from the
one displayed today. The photometric behaviour, determined with time-series and
colour-index analysis, suggests that V582 Mon (KH 15D) could be initially
surrounded by an accretion disk/torus seen edge-on, with subsequent thin dust
formation at the beginning of the blue radiation absorption. The dust could
then aggregate into larger particles providing the transition between selective
and total absorption, accompanied with eclipsing variability in the infrared.
The minima of the periodic light curve become deeper due to the increasing
dimension and number of dust grains, and then flattens due to a contraction in
the disk.

photometric colors, metallic line spectra and the hydrogen Balmer line profiles
are computed for magnetic stars with different metallicities and are discussed
with respect to those of non-magnetic reference models. The magnetically
enhanced line blanketing changes the atmospheric structure and leads to a
redistribution of energy in the stellar spectrum. The most noticeable feature
in the optical region is the appearance of the 5200 A depression. However, this
effect is prominent only in cool A stars and disappears for higher effective
temperatures. The presence of a magnetic field produces opposite variation of
the flux distribution in the optical and UV region. A deficiency of the UV flux
is found for the whole range of considered effective temperatures, whereas the
``null wavelength'' where flux remains unchanged shifts towards the shorter

agglomeration has been studied, preferentially for (low density) matter
agglomeration for which a logarithmic measure of its speed has been proposed. A
common diffusion as well as mechanical relaxation picture, emerging during the
mature growing stage, has been drawn using a phenomenological line of

B 71, 205112 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevB.71.205112",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We consider a system of interacting fermions in two dimensions beyond the
second-order perturbation theory in the interaction. It is shown that the
mass-shell singularities in the self-energy, arising already at the second
order of the perturbation theory, manifest a non-perturbative effect: an
interaction with the zero-sound mode. Resumming the perturbation theory for a
weak, short-range interaction and accounting for a finite curvature of the
fermion spectrum, we eliminate the singularities and obtain the results for the
quasi-particle self-energy and the spectral function to all orders in the
interaction with the zero-sound mode. A threshold for emission of zero-sound
waves leads a non-monotonic variation of the self-energy with energy (or
momentum) near the mass shell. Consequently, the spectral function has a
kink-like feature. We also study in detail a non-analytic temperature
dependence of the specific heat, $C(T)\propto T^2$. It turns out that although
the interaction with the collective mode results in an enhancement of the
fermion self-energy, this interaction does not affect the non-analytic term in
$C(T)$ due to a subtle cancellation between the contributions from the real and
imaginary parts of the self-energy. For a short-range and weak interaction,
this implies that the second-order perturbation theory suffices to determine
the non-analytic part of $C(T)$. We also obtain a general form of the
non-analytic term in $C(T)$, valid for the case of a generic Fermi liquid,
\emph{i.e.}, beyond the perturbation theory.

Because spherical harmonics are defined by integrals over spheres, however, one

presented a novel algorithm for computing the spherical harmonic components of

alternate series in powers of $(w-1)$. Moreover, one gets that the $n$-th
derivative of $\xi (w)$ at $ w=1$ can be bounded by the $(n-1)$-th one, and an
absolute lower bound for the $n$-th derivative $(-1)^n \xi^{(n)}(1) \geq

consistent with the dispersive bounds, and they strongly reduce the allowed

temporal stability of an exact travelling front solution, constructed in the
form of an integral expression, for a one-dimensional discrete Nagumo-like
model without recovery. Since the model is a piecewise linear one with an
on-site reaction function involving a Heaviside step function, a
straightforward linearisation around the front solution presents problems, and
we follow an alternative approach in estimating a `stability multiplier' by
looking at the variational problem as a succession of linear evolution of the
perturbations, punctuated with `kicks' of small but finite duration. The
perturbations get damped during the linear evolution, while the kicks amplify
only the perturbations located at specific sites (the `significant
perturbations', see below) with reference to the propagating front. Comparison
is made with results of numerical integration of the reaction-diffusion system
whereby it appears likely that the travelling front is temporally stable for
all parameter values characterising the model for which it exists. We modify
the system by introducing a slow variation of a relevant recovery parameter and
perform a leading order singular perturbation analysis to construct a pulse
solution in the resulting model. In addition, we obtain (in the leading order)
a 1-parameter family of periodic pulse trains for the system, modelling
re-entrant pulses in a one-dimensional ring of excitable cells.

Volkov, Ukr. J. Phys. 49, 1072 (2004)",,,"q-bio.BM",,"  The vibrational dynamics of a DNA molecule with counterions neutralizing the
charged phosphate groups have been studied. With the help of elaborated model
the conformational vibrations of the DNA double helix with alkaline metal ions
have been described both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the complexes of
DNA with counterions Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ the normal modes have been
found, and a mode characterized by the most notable ion displacements with
respect to the DNA backbone has been determined. The frequency of counterion
vibrations has been established to decrease as the ion mass increases. The
results of theoretical calculation have been showed to be in good agreement
with the experimental data of Raman spectroscopy.

solid-state quantum computing technology. In fullerene based quantum computer
technologies, we here propose to detect the single spin inside a fullerene by
transferring the quantum information from the endohedral spin to the ground
states of a molecular nanomagnet Fe$_{8}$, with large spin S=10. We show how to
perform the required SWAP operation and how to read out the information through
state-of-the-art techniques such as micro-SQUID.

  mechanics","14 pages, 8 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A powerful method for calculating the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator
consists of converting the energy eigenvalue equation into a matrix equation by
means of an appropriate basis set of functions. The convergence of the method
can be greatly improved by means of a variational parameter in the basis
functions determined by the principle of minimal sensitivity. In the case of
the quartic anharmonic oscillator and of a symmetrical double-well potential we
choose an effective oscillator frequency. In the case of nonsymmetrical
potential we add a coordinate shift in a two-parameter variational calculation.
The method not only gives the spectrum, but also an approximation to the energy
eigenfunctions. Consequently it can be used to solve the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation using the method of stationary states. We apply it to
the time development of two different initial wave functions in the double-well
slow roll potential.

  observables","4 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Entropic uncertainty relations, based on sums of entropies of probability
distributions arising from different measurements on a given pure state, can be
seen as a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation that is in many
cases a more useful way to quantify incompatibility between observables. Of
particular interest are relationships between `mutually unbiased' observables,
which are maximally incompatible. Lower bounds on the sum of entropies for sets
of two such observables, and for complete sets of observables within a space of
given dimension, have been found. This paper explores relations in the
intermediate regime of large, but far from complete, sets of unbiased
observables.

combinations of elementary two-qubit as well as irreducible many-qubit gates.

dot active region is presented. Direct passive measurement of the optical loss
within AlGaAs microdisk resonant structures embedded with InAs/InGaAs
dots-in-a-well (DWELL) is performed using an optical-fiber-based probing
technique at a wavelength (lambda~1400 nm) that is red-detuned from the dot
emission wavelength (lambda~1200 nm). Measurements in the 1400 nm wavelength
band on microdisks of diameter D = 4.5 microns show that these structures
support modes with cold-cavity quality factors as high as 360,000.
DWELL-containing microdisks are then studied through optical pumping at room
temperature. Pulsed lasing at lambda ~ 1200 nm is seen for cavities containing
a single layer of InAs dots, with threshold values of ~ 17 microWatts,
approaching the estimated material transparency level. Room-temperature
continuous wave operation is also observed.
