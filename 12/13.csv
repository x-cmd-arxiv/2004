Horizon-flow parameters in inflation and is general enough that can deal with
multiscalar quintessence scenarios, exotic matter components, and higher order
curvature corrections to General Relativity. We show how the shape of the dark
energy potential can be recovered non parametrically using this formalism and
we present approximations analogous to the ones relevant to slow-roll
inflation. Since presently available data do not allow a non-parametric and
exact reconstruction of the potential, we consider a general parametric
description. This reconstruction can also be used in other approaches followed
in the literature (e.g., the reconstruction of the redshift evolution of the
dark energy equation of state w(z)). Using observations of passively evolving
galaxies and supernova data we derive constraints on the dark energy potential
shape in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8. Our findings show that at the 1sigma
level the potential is consistent with being constant, although at the same
level of confidence variations cannot be excluded with current data. We
forecast constraints achievable with future data from the Atacama Cosmology

observations with the Hipparcos satellite show an eclipse-like light-curve with
primary and secondary eclipse. The eclipsing binary has a period of 0.435338
days and a circular orbit. Our spectroscopic observations however show that the
K0V primary is a single-line spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.3 years.
The minimum mass of the invisible component is about 0.9 Mo which means that
the mass of the companion is about the same as that of the primary. The first
inspection of our FEROS spectra, as well as a CES spectrum shows no obvious
companion. However, when the FEROS spectra are cross-correlated with an M-star,
a secondary becomes visible as a broad peak in the cross-correlation function.
The width and the position of this broad peak is variable on a short
time-scale. When phased to a period of 0.435338 days, the radial velocity
variations of the broad peak show the characteristic sine-wave of a
spectroscopic binary in a circular orbit. The best interpretation of this data
is that the broad peak in the cross-correlation function is caused by an
eclipsing binary consisting of two late-K, or early-M stars with an orbital
period of 0.435338 days. This is the eclipsing system. These two stars then
orbit the K0V-primary with a period of 3.3 years. The assumption that BS Ind is
a triple system consisting of a K0V star and two late-K, or early-M stars also
explains the unusual brightness of the object and the near infrared excess.
Thus, BS Ind is unique, as it contains by far the shortest-period young binary
star, and these stars are eclipsing.

suggest that dE galaxies formed from small units, developing a disk. This disk
was heated or destroyed by the winds induced by the star formation, and the

(of 10E-2 to 10E-6 of the Eddington rate) are impliedin both advection- and
jet-type models, with evidence for increasing ""radio-loudness"" with decreasing
Eddington fraction. The jets are energetically more significant than supernovae
in the LLAGN host galaxies, and are potentially able to dump sufficient energy
into the innermost parsecs to significantly slow the accretion inflow. Detailed

about a characteristic stellar mass ~3x10^{10}Msun. Less massive galaxies tend
to be ungrouped blue star-forming discs, while more massive galaxies are
typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap
between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at
z~1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L_*, and massive starbursts at
z~2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of
the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback
processes, all functions of the dark-matter halo mass and associated with a
similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass
M_shock~10^{12}Msun, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial
shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova
feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a
""fundamental line"". Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>M_shock
haloes preferentially at z>2 lead to massive starbursts in L>L_* galaxies. At
z<2, in M>M_shock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock,
and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such
as AGNs. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading
by passive evolution to ""red-and-dead"" massive spheroids starting at z~1. A
minimum in feedback efficiency near M_shock explains the observed minimum in
M/L and the qualitative features of the star-formation history. The cold flows
provide a hint for solving the angular-momentum problem. When these processes
are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bi-modality features and
solve other open puzzles.

magnetic field. The external field does not only suppress (or induce in some

parameter by inducing spin precession. This leads to an exactly marginal
correction to spin-fluctuation theory. We investigate how the interplay of
precession and damping determines the specific heat, magnetization,
magnetocaloric effect, susceptibility and scattering rates. We point out that
the precession can change the sign of the leading \sqrt{T} correction to the

c(T)/T for certain parameters. We argue that the susceptibility \chi =\partial

range. Nonmonotonic behavior of the resistivity is observed which is
characterized by two local maxima at $T\sim$2 K and $\sim$30 K. The temperature
dependence of the resistivity is interpreted as an interplay of weak
localization, weak antilocalization, and electron-electron interaction effects
in the diffusion and the Cooper channel. The temperature dependence of the
dephasing time $\tau_\phi$ extracted from the magnetoresistance data is
determined by the electron-phonon interaction. The saturation of $\tau_\phi$ in
the low-temperature limit correlates with $T_c$ of the individual crystal and
is ascribed to the scattering on magnetic impurities.

group H_4. It is found that, in the past literature, an important type of
irreducible representations of the corresponding algebra, h_4, were missed. We
present this ""new"" representations, which have the type of continuous series
representations. All the three types of representations of the previous
literature can be obtained from the ""new"" representations by setting the
momenta in the theory to special values. Then we realized the affine currents
of the WZNW model in terms of four bosonic free fields and constructed the
spectrum of the theory by acting the negative frequency modes of free fields on
the ground level states in the h_4 continuous series representation. The
spectrum is shown to be free of ghosts, after the Virasoro constraints are
satisfied. In particular we argued that there is no need for constraining one
of the longitudinal momenta to have unitarity. The tachyon vertex operator,
that correspond to a particular state in the ground level of the string
spectrum, is constructed. The operator products of the vertex operator with the
currents and the energy-momentum tensor are shown to have the correct forms,
with the correct conformal weight of the vertex operator.

backreaction of a quantum system to adiabatically changing external conditions.
Although the system is usually taken to be a quantum field, we show that this
restriction rather blurs than helps to clarify the statement of the problem. We
discuss the problem from the point of view of algebraic structure of quantum
theory, which is most appropriate in this context. The system in question may
be any quantum system, among others both finite as infinite dimensional
canonical systems are allowed. A simple finite-dimensional model is discussed.
We identify precisely the source of difficulties and infinities in most of
traditional treatments of the problem for infinite dimensional systems (such as
quantum fields), which is incompatibility of algebras of observables or their
representations. We formulate conditions on model idealizations which are
acceptable for the discussion of the adiabatic backreaction problem. In the
case of quantum field models in that class we find that the normal ordered
energy density is a well defined distribution, yielding global energy in the
limit of a unit test function. Although we see the ""zero point"" expressions as
inappropriate, we show how they can arise in the quantum field theory context
as a result of uncontrollable manipulations.

compact support property for measure-valued diffusion processes corresponding
to semi-linear equations of the form \[& u_t=Lu+\beta u-\alpha u^p \text{in}

interplay between the underlying motion (the diffusion process corresponding to
$L$) and the branching affects the compact support property. In \cite{EP99},
the compact support property was shown to be equivalent to a certain analytic
criterion concerning uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for the semilinear
parabolic equation related to the measured valued diffusion. In a subsequent
paper \cite{EP03}, this analytic property was investigated purely from the
point of view of partial differential equations. Some of the results obtained
in this latter paper yield interesting results concerning the compact support
property. In this paper, the results from \cite{EP03} that are relevant to the
compact support property are presented, sometimes with extensions. These
results are interwoven with new results and some informal heuristics. Taken
together, they yield a fairly comprehensive picture of the compact support
property. \it Inter alia\rm, we show that the concept of a measure-valued
diffusion \it hitting\rm a point can be investigated via the compact support
property, and suggest an alternate proof of a result concerning the hitting of
points by super-Brownian motion.

Starting with the study of an unstable optical lattice, we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for intrinsic phase stability, and discuss
two practical solutions to fulfill this condition, namely minimal and folded
optical lattices. We then present a particular example of two-dimensional
folded optical lattice which has the advantage of being symmetric, power
recycling and having a convenient geometry. We have used this lattice for laser
collimation of a continuous cesium beam in a fountain geometry.

placement of the septum is essential to the division of the cell. This step
depends on the proteins MinC, MinD, and MinE. Exposure to a constant external
field e.g., an electric field or magnetic field may cause the bacteria cell
division mechanism to change resulting in an abnormal cytokinesis. To have
insight into the effects of an external field on this process, we model the
process using a set of the deterministic reaction diffusion equations, which
incorporate the influence of an external field, min protein reactions, and
diffusion of all species. Using the numerical method, we have found some
changes in the dynamics of the oscillations of the min proteins from pole to
pole when compared that of without the external field. The results show some
interesting effects, which are qualitatively in good agreement with some
experimental results.

level, and concerned only with ecological timescales. We examine an
individual-based model of co-evolution on a spatial lattice based on the
Tangled Nature model, and show that reproduction, mutation and dispersion by
diffusion in an interacting system produces power-law Species-Area Relations as
observed in ecological measurements at medium scales. We find that
co-evolutionary habitats form, allowing high diversity levels in a spatially
homogenous system, and these are maintained for exponentially increasing time
when increasing system size.

continuously monitored open quantum systems modelled by quantum Langevin
equations. The optimal controller is expressed in terms of a modified
conditional state, which we call a risk-sensitive state, that represents
measurement knowledge tempered by the control purpose. One of the two
components of the optimal controller is dynamic, a filter that computes the
risk-sensitive state.
  The second component is an optimal control feedback function that is found by
solving the dynamic programming equation. The optimal controller can be
implemented using classical electronics.
  The ideas are illustrated using an example of feedback control of a two-level
atom.

information, which is quadratic and involves only one local spin observable at
each site. This inequality presents a hierarchic classification of all states
of multipartite quantum systems from separable to fully entangled states, which
is more powerful than the one presented by quadratic Bell inequalities from
two-entangled to fully entangled states. In particular, it is proved that the
inequality provides an exact test to distinguish entangled from nonentangled
pure states of two qubits. Our inequality sheds considerable light on
relationships between quantum entanglement and information theory.

nonradiative decay rates, fluorescence yields, and photobleaching of a
two-level atom radiating anywhere inside or outside a complex spherical
nanoshell, i.e. a stratified sphere consisting of alternating silica and gold
concentric spherical shells, are studied. The changes in the spectroscopic
properties of an atom interacting with complex nanoshells are significantly
enhanced, often more than two orders of magnitude, compared to the same atom
interacting with a homogeneous dielectric sphere. The detected fluorescence
intensity can be enhanced by 5 or more orders of magnitude. The changes
strongly depend on the nanoshell parameters and the atom position. When an atom
approaches a metal shell, decay rates are strongly enhanced yet fluorescence
exhibits a well-known quenching. Rather contra-intuitively, the Ohmic loss
contribution to the nonradiative decay rates for an atomic dipole within the
silica core of larger nanoshells may be decreasing when the silica core - inner
gold shell interface is approached. The quasistatic result that the radial
frequency shift in a close proximity of a spherical shell interface is
approximately twice as large as the tangential frequency shift appears to apply
also for complex nanoshells. Significantly modified spectroscopic properties
(see computer program (pending publication of this manuscript) freely available
at http://www.wave-scattering.com) can be observed in a broad band comprising
all (nonresonant) optical and near-infrared wavelengths.
