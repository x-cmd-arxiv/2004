120 h^-1 Mpc in the Streaming Motions of Abell Clusters (SMAC) sample. The bulk
flow of the SMAC sample is 687 +- 203 km/s, toward l = 260 +- 13, b = 0 +- 11.
We discuss possible systematic errors and show that no systematic effect is
larger than half of the random error. The flow does not drop off significantly
with depth, which suggests that it is generated by structures on large scales.
In particular, a Great Attractor as originally proposed by Lynden-Bell et al.
cannot be responsible for the SMAC bulk flow. The SMAC data suggest infall into
an attractor at the location of the Shapley Concentration, but the detection is
marginal (at the 90% confidence level). We find that distant attractors in
addition to the Shapley Concentration are required to explain the SMAC bulk
flow. A comparison with peculiar velocities predicted from the IRAS PSCz
redshift survey shows good agreement with a best fit value of Beta_I =
Omega^0.6/b_I = 0.39 +- 0.17. However, the PSCz density field is not sufficient
to acount for all of the SMAC bulk motion. We also detect, at the 98%
confidence level, a residual bulk flow of 372 +- 127 km/s toward l = 273, b = 6
which must be generated by sources not included in the PSCz catalogue, that is,
either beyond 200 h^-1 Mpc, in the Zone of Avoidance or in superclusters
undersampled by IRAS. Finally, we compare the SMAC bulk flow with other recent
measurements. We suggest that a bulk flow of 225 km/s toward l = 300, b = 10 at
depths greater than 60 h^-1 Mpc is consistent with all peculiar velocity
surveys, when allowance is made for sparse sampling effects. (abridged)

owing to the SMBH binary coalescence events. We find that the characteristic
strain amplitude of the background radiation is $h_c(f) \sim 10^{-16} (f/1 \mu

coalescence of SMBH binaries with total mass $M_{\rm tot} < 10^7 M_{\odot}$ at

sample we calculate the central Comptonization, y, and the integrated SZ flux
decrement, S, for each of our clusters. We find that the integrated SZ flux is
a more robust observable derived from our measurements than the central
Comptonization due to inadequacies in the spatial modelling of the
intra-cluster gas with a standard Beta model. This is highlighted by comparing
our central Comptonization results with values calculated from measurements
using the BIMA and OVRO interferometers. On average, the SuZIE calculated
central Comptonizations are approximately 60% higher in the cooling flow
clusters than the interferometric values, compared to only approximately 12%
higher in the non-cooling flow clusters. We believe this discrepancy to be in
large part due to the spatial modelling of the intra-cluster gas. From our
cluster sample we construct y-T and S-T scaling relations. The y-T scaling
relation is inconsistent with what we would expect for self-similar clusters;
however this result is questionable because of the large systematic uncertainty
in the central Comptonization. The S-T scaling relation has a slope and
redshift evolution consistent with what we expect for self-similar clusters
with a characteristic density that scales with the mean density of the

time history. The early spectra resemble those of a SN 1991T-like object but
with a relatively strong Ca H&K absorption feature. The first clear sign of Si
II 6355, characteristic of Type Ia supernovae, is found at day -7 and its
velocity remains constant up to at least the first month after B-band maximum
light. The transition to normal-looking spectra is found to occur earlier than

Branch-normal supernovae. Comparing the observations with synthetic spectra,
doubly ionized Fe, Si and Ni are identified at early epochs. These are
characteristic of SN 1991T-like objects. Furthermore, in the day -11 spectrum,
evidence is found for an absorption feature which could be identified as high
velocity C II 6580 or H-alpha. At the same epoch C III 4648.8 at photospheric
velocity is probably responsible for the absorption feature at 4500 A. High

that lack visible companions. In terms of microlensing observables, the mass is
given by M=(c^2/4G)\tilde r_E \theta_E and so requires the measurement of both
the angular Einstein radius, \theta_E, and the projected Einstein radius,
\tilde r_E. Simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.
Here we analyze OGLE-2003-BLG-238, a spectacularly bright (I_min=10.3),
high-magnification (A_max = 170) microlensing event. Pronounced finite source
effects permit a measurement of \theta_E = 650 uas. Although the timescale of
the event is only t_E = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on the
microlens parallax: 4.4 AU < \tilde r_E < 18 AU at the 1 \sigma level. Together
these two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 M_sun
< M < 1.48 M_sun. As was the case for MACHO-LMC-5, the only other single star
(apart from the Sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitational
effects, this estimate is rather crude. It does, however, demonstrate the
viability of the technique. We also discuss future prospects for single-lens
mass measurements.

clumpy substructure that may accelerate their initial relaxation. The cores of
Magellanic-Cloud clusters show universal expansion from r_c < 1 pc at birth to
r_c = 2 - 3 pc after 10^8 yr, but then seem to evolve along two bifurcating

mass-loss driven core expansion during the first 10^9 yr, followed by slow core
contraction and the onset of core collapse due to evaporation. The upper
branch, which shows continued core expansion proportional to logarithmic age,
remains unexplained. There is strong evidence for rapid mass segregation in
young clusters, yet little evidence for top-heavy IMFs or primordial mass
segregation. Finally, YMCs show similar structure throughout the Local Group

inward due to secular interactions in the disks, eventually exciting the
innermost planets. We study how the inward propagation of eccentricity in
planetary disks depends on the number and masses of the planets and spacing
between them and on the overall surface-density distribution in the disk. The
main governing factors are the large-scale surface-density distribution and the
total size of the system. If the smeared-out surface density is approximated by
a power-law \Sigma(r)\propto r^{-q}, then eccentricity disturbances propagate
inward efficiently for flat density distributions with q < 1. If this condition
is satisfied and the size of the planetary system is 50 AU or larger, the
typical eccentricities excited by this mechanism by field star encounters in
the solar neighborhood over 5 Gyr are in the range 0.01-0.1. Higher
eccentricities (> 0.1) may be excited in planetary systems around stars that
are formed in relatively dense, long-lived open clusters. Therefore, this
mechanism may provide a natural way to excite the eccentricities of extrasolar
planets.

field (~100 microGauss) and a surprising lack of molecular hydrogen given its
total hydrogen column density. Here we compute photoionization models of the
veil to establish its gas density and its distance from the Trapezium. We use a
greatly improved model of the hydrogen molecule that determines level

Therefore, the veil is the first interstellar environment where magnetic

certainly exist, details remain uncertain, particularly in the inner Galaxy,
where stars and H II regions in the Galactic plane are obscured optically. In
this paper we revisit two previously studied, inner Galaxy H II regions:
G333.6-0.2 and W43. We observed three new positions in G333.6-0.2 with the
Kuiper Airborne Observatory and reobserved the central position with the
Infrared Space Observatory's Long Wavelength Spectrometer in far-infrared lines
of S++, N++, N+, and O++. We also added the N+ lines at 122 and 205 micron to
the suite of lines measured in W43 by Simpson et al. (1995). The measured
electron densities range from ~40 to over 4000 cm-3 in a single H II region,
indicating that abundance analyses must consider density variations, since the
critical densities of the observed lines range from 40 to 9000 cm-3. We propose
a method to handle density variations and make new estimates of the S/H and N/H
abundance ratios. We find that our sulfur abundance estimates for G333.6-0.2
and W43 agree with the S/H abundance ratios expected for the S/H abundance
gradient previously reported by Simpson et al. The estimated N/H, S/H, and N/S
ratios are the most reliable because of their small corrections for unseen
ionization states (< 10%). We compute models of the two H II regions to
estimate corrections for the other unseen ionization states. We discuss these
predictions and conclude that only a few of the latest models adequately
reproduce H II region observations, including the well-known, relatively-large
observed Ne++/O++ ratios in low- and moderate-excitation H II regions.

as massive as, or possibly more massive than, the well-known hot intra-cluster

archetypal jet-driven bipolar velocity field, if shocks are important anywhere
they should be important in this object. Having mapped the emission line fluxes
and velocity field, we first compare the ionization conditions to standard
photoionization and shock models. We find coherent variations of ionization
consistent with photoionization model sequences which combine optically thick

photoionization models of just optically thick gas. Furthermore, we find

this object provides the strongest case to date against the importance of shock
related ionization in Seyferts.

that temperature profiles of clusters at large radii decline; however

Shower Array (AGASA) observation. In this paper, we discuss the statistical
significance of this discrepancy between the two experiments. We calculate
arrival distribution of UHECRs above $10^{19}$ eV predicted by the source
models constructed using the Optical Redshift Survey galaxy sample. We apply
the new method developed by us for calculating arrival distribution in the
presence of the galactic magnetic field. The great advantage of this method is
that it enables us to calculate UHECR arrival distribution with lower energy
($\sim 10^{19}$ eV) than previous studies within reasonable time by following
only the trajectories of UHECRs actually reaching the earth. It has been
realized that the small scale anisotropy observed by the AGASA can be explained
with the source number density $\sim 10^{-5 \sim -6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ assuming weak
extragalactic magnetic field ($B \le 1$ nG). We find that the predicted small
scale anisotropy for this source number density is also consistent with the
current HiRes data. We thus conclude that the statement by the HiRes experiment
that they do not find small scale anisotropy in UHECR arrival distribution is
not statistically significant at present. We also show future prospect of
determining the source number density with increasing amount of observed data.

  The methanol emitting region around W3(H2O) has an extent of 2.0"" x 1.2""
(4400 x 2600 AU). The density is of order 1.e7 cm-3, sufficient to thermalize
most of the methanol lines. The kinetic temperature is approximately 140 K and
the methanol fractional abundance greater than 1.e-6, indicative of a high
degree of grain mantle evaporation. The W3(H2O) source contains sub-structure,

we also account for the nonadiabatic effects, which favour the growth of the

Several of their properties (size of the core, MS lifetimes, tracks,
abundances) are closer to those of models without rotation than with rotation
only. In particular, the observed N/C or N/H excesses in OB stars are better
explained by our previous models with rotation only than by the present models

The fraction of sources found to be variable increases with observed flux,
suggesting that >90% of all AGNs possess intrinsic variability. We also find
that the fraction of variable sources appears to decrease with increasing
intrinsic absorption; a lack of variability in hard, absorbed AGNs could be due
to an increased contribution of reflected X-rays to the total flux. We do not
detect significant spectral variability in the majority (~70%) of our sources.
In half of the remaining 30%, the hardness ratio is anti-correlated with flux,
mimicking the high/soft-low/hard states of galactic sources. The X-ray
variability appears anti-correlated with the luminosity of the sources, in
agreement with previous studies. High redshift sources, however, have larger
variability amplitudes than expected from extrapolations of their low-z

induces a significant spin splitting even at very small values of the applied
field. Several methods of measuring the carrier density (Hall effect, filling
factors of the Landau levels at high field, various manifestations of
Moss-Burstein shifts) are described and calibrated. The value of the spin
splitting needed to fully polarize the hole gas, evidences a strong enhancement
of the spin susceptibility of the hole gas due to carrier-carrier interaction.
At small values of the spin splitting, whatever the carrier density (non zero)
is, photoluminescence lines are due to the formation of charged excitons in the
singlet state. Spectral shifts in photoluminescence and in transmission
(including an ""excitonic Moss-Bustein shift"") are observed and discussed in
terms of excitations of the partially or fully polarized hole gas. At large
spin splitting, and without changing the carrier density, the singlet state of
the charged exciton is destabilized in favour of a triplet state configuration
of holes. The binding energy of the singlet state is thus measured and found to
be independent of the carrier density (in contrast with the splitting between
the charged exciton and the neutral exciton lines). The state stable at large
spin splitting is close to the neutral exciton at low carrier density, and
close to an uncorrelated electron-hole pair at the largest values of the
carrier density achieved. The triplet state gives rise to a characteristic
double-line structure with an indirect transition to the ground state (with a
strong phonon replica) and a direct transition to an excited state of the hole

prominent elementary process only. What is often overlooked in this approach is
that in macroscopic systems of technological relevance typically a large number

observable system properties and functions is then not only determined by the
detailed individual properties of each process alone, but in many, if not most

crucial role. For a ""predictive materials science modeling with microscopic

applied. Modern electronic structure theory methods such as DFT have become a
standard tool for the accurate description of individual molecular processes.

it is not clear whether there exists a notion of global temperature
characterizing the multi-horizon spacetimes. We examine the conditions under
which a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using
the example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically
extend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor,
response of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for
identifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the
SDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart
which covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a
consistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS
spacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two
temperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS
spacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c)
Even when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal
nature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate
chart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other
charts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures. The
coordinate dependence of the thermal nature is reminiscent of the flat
spacetime in Minkowski and Rindler coordinate charts. The implications are
discussed.

  Quasinormal modes dominate almost every process involving black holes, in
particular gravitational wave emission during, for example, the collision
between two black holes. It may be possible to create black holes at future
accelerators, according to recent theories advocating the existence of extra

gravitational radiation emitted in high energy collision between two black
holes in several dimensions, and also to make a theoretical study of
gravitational waves in higher dimensions.

${\mathfrak A}_{\Lambda}$ has a unique (up to unitary equivalence) irreducible

observables is defined as the algebra of gauge invariant fields, satisfying the
Gauss law. In order to take into account correlations of field degrees of
freedom inside $\Lambda$ with the ``rest of the world'', we have to extend
${\mathfrak O}^i_{\Lambda}$ by tensorizing with the algebra of gauge invariant
operators at infinity. This way we construct the full observable algebra
${\mathfrak O}_{\Lambda} .$ It is proved that its irreducible representations
are labelled by ${\mathbb Z}_3$-valued boundary flux distributions. Then, it is
shown that there exist unitary operators (charge carrying fields), which
intertwine between irreducible sectors leading to a classification of
irreducible representations in terms of the ${\mathbb Z}_3$-valued global
boundary flux. By the global Gauss law, these 3 inequivalent charge
superselection sectors can be labeled in terms of the global colour charge

space ${\sf H}_{graviton}$ carries the direct sum of two unitary irreducible
representations of the Poincar\'e group corresponding to two particles of mass
$m > 0$ and spins 2 and 0, respectively. This Hilbert space is canonically
isomorphic to a space of the type $Ker(Q)/Im(Q)$ where $Q$ is a gauge charge
defined in an extension of the Hilbert space ${\cal H}_{\rm graviton}$

$u_{\mu}, \tilde{u}_{\mu}$ (which are vector Fermi fields) and $v_{\mu}$ (which

framework. We obtain a solution which goes smoothly to the zero-mass solution
of linear quantum gravity up to a term depending on the bosonic ghost field.
This solution depends on two real constants as it should be; these constants
are related to the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant. In the

the model category of simplicial k-modules, and obtain this way a notion of
geometric derived stacks which are the main geometric objects of Derived
Algebraic Geometry. We give several examples of derived version of classical
moduli stacks, as for example the derived stack of local systems on a space, of
algebra structures over an operad, of flat bundles on a projective complex
manifold, etc. Finally, we present the cases where C=(k) is the model category
of unbounded complexes of modules over a char 0 ring k, and C=Sp^{\Sigma} the
model category of symmetric spectra. In these two contexts, called respectively
Complicial and Brave New Algebraic Geometry, we give some examples of geometric
stacks such as the stack of associative dg-algebras, the stack of
dg-categories, and a geometric stack constructed using topological modular
forms.
