galaxies moving through an intergalactic medium. In agreement with previous
investigations,we find that when the ram pressure stripping does not disrupt
the ISM, it usually has a negligible effect on the galactic wind dynamics. Only
when the IGM ram pressure is comparable to the central ISM thermal pressure the
stripping and the superwind influence each other increasing the gas removal
rate. In this case several parameters regulate the ISM ejection process, as the
original distribution of the ISM and the geometry of the IGM-galaxy
interaction. When the ISM is not removed by the ram pressure or the wind, it
loses memory of the starburst episode and recovers almost its pre-burst
distribution in a timescale of 50-200 Myr. After this time another star
formation episode becomes, in principle, possible. Evidently, galactic winds
are consistent with a recurrent bursts star formation history.
  Contrary to the ISM content, the amount of the metal-rich ejecta retained by
the galaxy is more sensitive to the ram pressure action. Part of the ejecta is
first trapped in a low density, extraplanar gas produced by the IGM-ISM
interaction, and then pushed back onto the galactic disc. The amount of trapped
metals in a moving galaxy may be up to three times larger than in a galaxy at
rest. This prediction may be tested comparing metallicity of dwarf galaxies in
nearby poor clusters or groups, such as Virgo or Fornax, with the field
counterpart. The sensitivity of the metal entrapment efficiency on the geometry
of the interaction may explain part of the observed scatter in the
metallicity-luminosity relation for dwarf galaxies.

The accretion history of SMBHs can be reconstructed using observations at high

the submillimeter, infrared, optical, and X-ray wavebands are used as
constraints, along with data from the demography of local black holes.
Theoretical modeling of the growth of black hole mass with cosmic time has been
pursued thus far in two distinct directions: a phenomenological approach that
utilizes observations in various wavebands, and a semi-analytic approach that
starts with a theoretical framework and a set of assumptions with a view to
matching observations. Both techniques have been pursued in the context of the

connecting the double-peaked emitters with the greater AGN population: in
double-peaked emitters the accretion rate onto the black hole is low, making
the wind feeble and allowing the lines from the underlying disk to shine
through. This scenario also implies that in the majority of AGNs, the wind is

synchrotron radio emission (radio halos) observed in a growing number of
massive clusters (Feretti 2003) and from hard X-ray (HXR) excess emission
(detected in a few cases) which can be explained in terms of IC scattering of
relativistic electrons off the cosmic microwave background photons
(Fusco-Femiano et al. 2003). There are now growing evidences that giant radio
halos may be naturally accounted for by synchrotron emission from relativistic
electrons reaccelerated by some kind of turbulence generated in the cluster
volume during merger events (Brunetti 2003). With the aim to investigate the
connection between thermal and non-thermal properties of the ICM, we have
developed a statistical magneto-turbulent model which describes the evolution
of the thermal and non-thermal emission from clusters. We calculate the energy
and spectrum of the magnetosonic waves generated during cluster mergers, the
acceleration and evolution of relativistic electrons and thus the resulting
synchrotron and inverse Compton spectra. Here we give a brief description of

that Hgamma and Hdelta, unlike Hbeta, are very sensitive to alpha/Fe ratio
changes at super-solar metallicities. Both line indices increase significantly
with increasing alpha/Fe ratio. This effect cannot be neglected when these line
indices are used to derive the ages of metal-rich, unresolved stellar
populations like early-type galaxies. We re-analyze the elliptical galaxy
sample of Kuntschner (2000), and show that consistent age estimates from Hbeta

present in the literature, namely that Hgamma and Hdelta have up to now led to
significantly younger ages for early-type galaxies than Hbeta. Our work
particularly impacts on the interpretation of intermediate to high-redshift

dissipation of currents in the neutron star crust. I discuss field evolution in
the crust due to the Hall effect, and outline when it dominates Ohmic decay.
This emphasises the importance of understanding the impurity level in the
crust. Second, I briefly discuss the progress that has been made in
understanding the magnetic fields of neutron stars currently accreting matter
in low mass X-ray binaries. In particular, thermonuclear X-ray bursts offer a
promising probe of the magnetic field of these neutron stars.

central regions can have quite disturbed kinematics, likely due to the effects
of the AGN activity and in particular of the powerful radio jets. The recent
detection of fast nuclear gas outflows, observed both in ionised and neutral

Field Limit approach to recover both situations under the same formalism,
describing not only the two geometries just mentioned but also any intermediate
possible configurations of the system source-lens-observer, without any
small-angle limitations. This is done for any spherically symmetric black holes

improving the observational estimates. In particular, for the case of the star
S2, we give sharp predictions for the magnitude of the relativistic images and
the time of their highest brightness, which should occur at the beginning of
year 2018. The observation of such images would open fascinating perspectives
on the measure of the physical parameters of the central black hole, including
mass, spin and distance.

NIR photometry extends to the M'-band (4.7 mu), making SN 1998S only the second
ever supernova for which such a long IR wavelength has been detected. The shape
and evolution of the H alpha and HeI 1.083 mu line profiles indicate a powerful
interaction with a progenitor wind, as well as providing evidence of dust
condensation within the ejecta. The latest optical spectrum suggests that the
wind had been flowing for at least 430 years. The intensity and rise of the HK
continuum towards longer wavelengths together with the relatively bright L' and
M' magnitudes shows that the NIR emission was due to hot dust newly-formed in
supernovae may provide the ejecta and/or pre-existing dust in the progenitor
circumstellar medium (CSM). [ABRIDGED] Possible origins for the NIR emission
are considered. Significant radioactive heating of ejecta dust is ruled out, as
is shock/X-ray-precursor heating of CSM dust. More plausible sources are (a) an
IR-echo from CSM dust driven by the UV/optical peak luminosity, and (b)
emission from newly-condensed dust which formed within a cool, dense shell
produced by the ejecta shock/CSM interaction. We argue that the evidence
favours the condensing dust hypothesis, although an IR-echo is not ruled out.
Within the condensing-dust scenario, the IR luminosity indicates the presence
of at least 0.001 solar masses of dust in the ejecta, and probably considerably
more. Finally, we show that the late-time intrinsic (K-L') evolution of type II
supernovae may provide a useful tool for determining the presence or absence of
a massive CSM around their progenitor stars.

with a plane-wave basis demonstrate that for the in-plane optical modes, the
generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) yields frequencies lower by 2% than
the local-density approximation (LDA) and is thus in better agreement with

validity of force-constant approaches that take only interaction with few

removed, the presence of the ambient magnetic field induces a shift of the dip
position from B_0 ~ 0 to a value B ~ B_1, which is about the average value of
the earth magnetic field, at our latitude. When the SQIF is cooled in the

further shielding of the SQIF results in a shift of the dip towards B_0 ~ 0.

magnetic field. The experimental results are discussed in view of potential
applications of high-T_c SQIFs in magnetometry.

topology is possible in higher-dimensional spacetimes. One of these is the
black ring horizon with $S^1\times S^{D-3}$ topology where $D$ is the spacetime
dimension number. In this paper, we investigate the black ring horizon
formation in systems with $n$-particles. We analyze two kinds of system: the
high-energy $n$-particle system and the momentarily-static $n$-black-hole
initial data. In the high-energy particle system, we prove that the black ring
horizon does not exist at the instant of collision for any $n$. But there
remains a possibility that the black ring forms after the collision and this
result is not sufficient. Because calculating the metric of this system after
the collision is difficult, we consider the momentarily-static $n$-black-hole
initial data that can be regarded as a simplified $n$-particle model and
numerically solve the black ring horizon that surrounds all the particles. Our
results show that there is the minimum particle number that is necessary for
the black ring formation and this number depends on $D$. Although many particle
number is required in five-dimensions, $n=4$ is sufficient for the black ring
formation in the $D\ge 7$ cases. The black ring formation becomes easier for
larger $D$. We provide a plausible physical interpretation of our results and
discuss the validity of Ida and Nakao's conjecture for the horizon formation in
higher-dimensions. Finally we briefly discuss the probable methods of producing
the black rings in accelerators.

the covariant structure of the neutrino self-energy in the presence of a
constant magnetic field. The neutrino energy spectrum and index of refraction
are obtained for neutral and charged media in the strong-field limit ($M_{W}\gg
\sqrt{B}\gg m_{e},T,\mu ,| \mathbf{p}| $) using the lowest Landau level
approximation. The results found within the lowest Landau level approximation
are numerically validated, summing in all Landau levels, for strong $B\gg
T^{2}$ and weakly-strong $B \gtrsim T^{2}$ fields. The neutrino energy in
leading order of the Fermi coupling constant is expressed as the sum of three
terms: a kinetic-energy term, a term of interaction between the magnetic field
and an induced neutrino magnetic moment, and a rest-energy term. The leading
radiative correction to the kinetic-energy term depends linearly on the
magnetic field strength and is independent of the chemical potential. The other
two terms are only present in a charged medium. For strong and weakly-strong
fields, it is found that the field-dependent correction to the neutrino energy
in a neutral medium is much larger than the thermal one. Possible applications
to cosmology and astrophysics are considered.

Convergence is improved by fitting the two-nucleon contact interactions to the

extended here to the three-nucleon system. The improvement is particularly
striking in the doublet-S wave (triton) channel, where better agreement to
potential-model calculations and better convergence from order to order in the
