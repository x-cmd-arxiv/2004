magnetized plasma wind streaming from the Sun. The magnetic field shields the
Earth's surface from penetrating high energy solar wind particles, as well as
interstellar cosmic rays. The magnetic dipole has reversed sign some hundreds
of times over the last 400 million years. These polarity reversals correspond
to drastic breakdowns of the dynamo action. The question arises what the
consequences for the Earth's atmosphere, climate, and, in particular, biosphere
are. It is shown by kinematic estimates and three-dimensional plasma-neutral
gas simulations that the solar wind can induce very fast a magnetic field in
the previously completely unmagnetized Earth's ionosphere that is strong enough
to protect Earth from cosmic radiations comparable to the case of an intact
magnetic dynamo.

massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) and the mass fraction of the Galactic
halo made by this type of dark matter. Statistical analysis shows that by
considering a Dirac-Delta mass function (MF) for the MACHOs, their mean mass is
about that of a white dwarf star. This result is, however, in discrepancy with
other observations such as those of non-observed expected white dwarfs in the
Galactic halo which give rise to metal abundance, polluting the interstellar
medium by their evolution. Here we use the hypothesis of the spatially varying
MF of MACHOs, proposed by Kerins and Evans to interpret microlensing events. In
this model, massive lenses with a lower population contribute to the
microlensing events more frequently than do dominant brown dwarfs. This effect
causes the mean mass of the observed lenses to be larger than the mean mass of
all the lenses. A likelihood analysis is performed to find the best parameters
of the spatially varying MF that are compatible with the duration distribution
of Large Magellanic Cloud microlensing candidates of the MACHO experiment.

can explain two other bursts in this sample as forward shock synchrotron
emission provided that the magnetic field parameter during the burst is close
to equipartition, and larger by a factor of 100 than the afterglow value at ~1
day. The remaining seven bursts cannot be explained in the external shock model

density of the surrounding medium to take on any physically permitted value;
the peak of the spectrum is above the cooling frequency, therefore the peak

about an order of magnitude than the observed values. We have also considered
inverse-Compton scattering in forward and reverse shock regions and find that

of subhalo populations over ranges of 1000 in halo mass and 1000 in the ratio
of subhalo to parent halo mass. The subhalo populations of different haloes are
not scaled copies of each other, but vary systematically with halo properties.
On average, the amount of substructure increases with halo mass. At fixed mass,
it decreases with halo concentration and with halo formation redshift. These
trends are comparable in size to the scatter in subhalo abundance between
similar haloes. Averaged over all haloes of given mass, the abundance of low
mass subhaloes per unit parent halo mass is independendent of parent mass.It is
very similar to the abundance per unit mass of low mass haloes in the universe
as a whole, once differing boundary definitions for subhaloes and haloes are
accounted for. The radial distribution of subhaloes within their parent haloes
is substantially less centrally concentrated than that of the dark matter. It
varies at most weakly with the mass(or concentration) of the parent halo and
not at all with subhalo mass. It does depend on the criteria used to define the
subhalo population considered. About 90% of present-day subhaloes were accreted
after z=1 and about 70% after z=0.5. Only about 8% the total mass of all haloes
accreted at z=1 survives as bound subhaloes at z=0. For haloes accreted at z=2,
the survival mass fraction is just 2%. Subhaloes seen near the centre of their
parent typically were accreted earlier and retain less of their original mass
than those seen near the edge. These strong systematics mean that comparison
with galaxies in real clusters is only possible if the formation of the
luminous component is modelled appropriately.

significant may have ramifications for planetary accretion rates and migration
rates. We discuss in particular the effect of temperature variations near the
sublimation point of water, since the formation of ice can enhance the
accretion rate of disk material onto a planet. Shadowing effects can cool the
disk enough that ice will form closer to the star than previously expected,
effectively moving the snow line inward.

high signal-to-noise QSO absorption spectra at a median redshift of z=2.25, and
the data from Croft et al. (2002) at a median redshift of z=2.72, together with
a large suite of high-resolution large box-size hydro-dynamical simulations, to
estimate the linear dark matter power spectrum on scales 0.003 s/km < k <0.03
s/km. Our re-analysis of the Croft et al. data agrees well with their results
if we assume the same mean optical depth and gas temperature-density relation.
The inferred linear dark matter power spectrum at z=2.72 also agrees with that
inferred from LUQAS at lower redshift if we assume that the increase of the
amplitude is due to gravitational growth between these redshifts. We further
argue that the smaller mean optical depth measured from high-resolution spectra
is more accurate than the larger value obtained from low-resolution spectra by
Press et al. (1993) which Croft et al. used. For the smaller optical depth we
obtain a ~ 20% higher value for the rms fluctuation amplitude of the matter
density. By combining the amplitude of the matter power spectrum inferred from
the Lyman-alpha forest with the amplitude on large scales inferred from
measurements of the CMB we obtain constraints on the primordial spectral index
n and the normalisation sigma_8. For values of the mean optical depth favoured
by high-resolution spectra, the inferred linear power spectrum is consistent
with a LambdaCDM model with a scale-free (n=1) primordial power spectrum.

Whereas unresolved X-ray sources tend to be associated with galaxies in

galaxies in the central cluster. In particular, a distinct X-ray trail appears
on one side of the fast-moving galaxy C153, clearly due to ram-pressure
stripping. The diffuse X-ray emission from the central cluster can be
characterized by a thermal plasma with a characteristic temperature of
$3.2_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$ keV and a heavy element abundance of $0.24_{-0.12}^{+0.15}$

intergalactic gas with a characteristic temperature of $0.98_{-0.27}^{+0.22}$

a ROSAT observation showed that this system consists of two distinct clusters
(A1758N and A1758S) separated by approximately $8\arcmin$ (a projected
separation of 2 Mpc in the rest frame of the clusters). Only a few galaxy
redshifts have been published for these two clusters, but the redshift of the
Fe lines in the Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra shows that the recessional
velocities of A1758N and A1758S are within 2,100 km s$^{-1}$. Thus, these two
clusters most likely form a gravitationally bound system, but our imaging and
spectroscopic analyses of the X-ray data do not reveal any sign of interaction
between the two clusters. The Chandra and XMM-Newton observations show that
A1758N and A1758S are both undergoing major mergers.
  A1758N is in the late stages of a large impact parameter merger between two 7
keV clusters. The two remnant cores have a projected separation of 800 kpc.
Based on the measured pressure jumps preceding the two cores, they are receding
from one another at less than 1,600 km s$^{-1}$. The two cores are surrounded
by hotter gas ($\mathrm{kT}=9$--12 keV) that was probably shock heated during
the early stages of the merger. The gas entropy in the two remnant cores is
comparable with the central entropy observed in dynamically relaxed clusters,
indicating that the merger-induced shocks stalled as they tried to penetrate
the high pressure cores of the two merging systems.Each core also has a wake of
low entropy gas indicating that this gas was ram pressure stripped without
being strongly shocked (abridged). (A copy of the paper with higher resolution

peculiarly, it has periodical radio and X-ray emission together with strong,
variable gamma-ray emission. This source remains, however, quite enigmatic.
Some properties of this system can be explained assuming that the unseen
companion is a non-accreting young pulsar with a relativistic wind strongly
interacting with the wind of the Be star. On the contrary, other properties of
LSI+61303 fit a model where the companion is accreting even with two events of
super-critical accretion along the orbit. The very recent discovery of a radio
jet extending ca. 200 AU at both sides of a central core has definitely proved
the occurrence of accretion--ejection processes in this system. Therefore it is
of great interest to combine this result with previous observations at other
wavelengths within the framework of the two-peak accretion (ejection) model.
Concerning the first ejection, we show that the observed gamma-rays variations
might be periodic with outbursts confined around the periastron passage (i.e.
where the first accretion-rate peak occurs and high-energy emission but no
radio emission is predicted). Concerning the second ejection, with radio
bursts, we point out that it can be also traced in the X-ray data, both in
episodes of hardening of the X-ray emission and in a transition from soft- to
hard-states at the onsets of radiobursts. In fact, both hardening and
transitions between spectral states are related to the dramatic change in the
structure of the accretion disk preceeding the ejection. Finally, we explore
the nature of the accretor and we conclude that on the basis of the present
optical data a black hole cannot be ruled out.

is present in the high-diffusivity (upper) layer in the lateral direction (i.e.
perpendicular to the shear flow in the lower layer). This is probably a
realistic first representation of the situation near the bottom of the solar
convective zone, as the strongly subadiabatic stratification of the tachocline
(lower layer in the interface dynamo) imposes a strong upper limit on the speed
of any meridional flow there.
  Analytic solutions to the eigenvalue problem are presented for the cases of
vanishing diffusivity contrast and infinite diffusivity contrast, respectively.
Unlike the trivial case of a homogeneous system, the ability of the meridional
flow to reverse the propagation of the dynamo wave is strongly reduced in the
interface dynamo. In particular, in the limit of high diffusivity contrast
relevant to the solar case it is found that a meridional flow of realistic
amplitude cannot reverse the direction of propagation of the dynamo wave. The
implications of this result for the solar dynamo problem are discussed.

(Gamma Ray Burst Theory 2) on the Collapsar and Supranova Models held 25 July
2003 at the 10th Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity, Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. A central issue in GRB studies is the process whereby energy
is released from the GRB engine. One scenario is the collapsar model, where the
evolved stellar core promptly collapses to a black hole surrounded by a
massive, intermittently-accreting torus of nuclear density material. A second
scenario is the supranova model, where the first step of a two-step collapse
process leaves behind a rapidly rotating neutron star stabilized by rotation,
which later collapses to a black hole while making the GRB. In the supranova
model, a powerful pulsar wind lasting days to weeks after the supernova makes
distinctive signatures from the heating of the supernova remnant (SNR) shell,
which should be discovered with Swift. This model also predicts nonstandard
reddened excesses from the cooling SNR due to the range of delays between the
two collapse events, contrary to observations of SN emissions from low redshift
GRBs which favor the collapsar model. The observational basis for both models
is critically reviewed. An outline of a GRB model is proposed where the second
collapse takes place within minutes to hours after the primary SN event, during
which time loss of centrifugal support along the rotation axis of the neutron
star provides a relatively baryon-clean polar environment along which a newly
formed, rapidly spinning black hole drives collimated baryon-dilute outflows.

both the square of the wavelength and the current amplitude. We have also

that crack initiation from an incision on the film occurs at a load much higher

incisions thus cause the crack to propagate intermittently. Microscopically,
this mode of crack initiation and propagation in geometrically confined thin
adhesive films is related to the nucleation of cavitation bubbles behind the
incision which must grow and coalesce before a viable crack propagates. Our
theoretical analysis allows us to rationalize these experimental observations
qualitatively and quantitatively and suggests a simple design criterion for

that this strong coupling perspective represents the natural framework for a
generalization of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The main result of
this analysis is twofold: 1) It provides the tools for a unified treatment of
any non-local contribution to the Hamiltonian. Within our scheme, non-local
terms such as hopping terms, spin-spin interactions, or non-local Coulomb
interactions are treated on equal footing. 2) By performing a detailed
strong-coupling analysis of a generalized lattice problem, we establish the
basis for possible clean and systematic extensions beyond DMFT. To this end, we
study the problem using three different perspectives. First, we develop a
generalized expansion around the atomic limit in terms of the coupling
constants for the non-local contributions to the Hamiltonian. By analyzing the
diagrammatics associated with this expansion, we establish the equations for a
generalized dynamical mean-field theory (G-DMFT). Second, we formulate the
theory in terms of a generalized strong coupling version of the Baym-Kadanoff
functional. Third, following Pairault, Senechal, and Tremblay, we present our
scheme in the language of a perturbation theory for canonical fermionic and
bosonic fields and we establish the interpretation of various strong coupling
quantities within a standard perturbative picture.

dynamics in a model of viscous silica above and below the critical temperature
of the mode coupling theory, $T_{MCT}$. Specifically, we follow the evolution
of the dynamic heterogeneity as the temperature dependence of the transport
coefficients shows a crossover from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior when
the melt is cooled. It is demonstrated that, on intermediate time scales, a
small fraction of oxygen and silicon atoms are more mobile than expected from a
Gaussian approximation. These highly mobile particles form transient clusters
larger than that resulting from random statistics, indicating that dynamics are
spatially heterogeneous. An analysis of the clusters reveals that the mean
cluster size is maximum at times intermediate between ballistic and diffusive
motion, and the maximum size increases with decreasing temperature. In
particular, the growth of the clusters continues when the transport
coefficients follow an Arrhenius law. These findings imply that the structural
relaxation in silica cannot be understood as a statistical bond breaking
process. Though the mean cluster sizes for silica are at the lower end of the
spectrum of values reported in the literature, we find that spatially
heterogeneous dynamics in strong and fragile glass formers are similar on a
qualitative level. However, different from results for fragile liquids, we show
that correlated particle motion along quasi one-dimensional, string-like paths
is of little importance for the structural relaxation in this model of silica,
suggesting that string-like motion is suppressed by the presence of covalent
bonds.

post-Newtonian accuracy. Our final results can be viewed as computing new

equivalently, new short-period contributions to the gravitational wave
polarizations, $h_{+,\times}$, that should be explicitly added to the
`post-Newtonian' expansion for $h_{+,\times}$, if one treats radiative effects
on the orbital phasing of the latter in the usual adiabatic approximation. Our

emerging that one--gluon--exchange does not provide the appropiate means to

insight. In particular the rich spectrum of baryon resonances is very well
suited to test dynamical quark models using constituent quarks, a confinement

question if glueballs and hybrids exist. There is the possibility that two

orbit, it is similar to narrow-band resonance described by the Mathieu
equation. For an elliptic orbit, the instabilities exhibit tachyonic nature. In
the narrow-band regime, we show that the existence of the instabilities is
crucial to the formation of $Q$-balls. The $Q$-ball formation proceeds through

some fraction of the charge of the $Q$-ball is emitted. This discovery may

two-hadron-reducible contributions, which are given by convolution of baryon

that the two-hadron-reducible contributions are large in the operator product
expansion of the correlation functions of three existing works on the
pentaquark. Therefore, it is dangerous to draw a conclusion from the sum rules
using naive pentaquark correlation functions with naive ansatz for the spectral
function under the dispersion integral. Instead, we propose to use the
two-hadron-irreducible correlation function, which is obtained by subtracting
the two-hadron-reducible contribution from the naive correlation function.
Taking one of the works as an example we demonstrate how drastically the
results can change if we remove the two-hadron-reducible part from the naive
correlation function. We obtain the result opposite to the original work for
the parity of the pentaquark.

A coupling for large tanb. The inclusion of CP-violating phases in mu and A

cosmologically acceptable neutralino relic densities in regions far from the

allow for phases in the gaugino masses and in particular the gluino mass.

  A general class of dynamical groups are semidirect products K *s N for which

  This paper explores a more general dynamical group candidate that is also a
semi-direct product but where the 'translation' normal subgroup N is now the
Heisenberg group.
  The relevant automorphisms of the Heisenberg group are the symplectic group.
This together with the requirement for an orthogonal metric leads to the
pseudo-unitary group for the homogeneous group K.
  The physical meaning and motivation of this group, called the quaplectic

  As a first application, we show that if \g is a Lie algebra over a field of
characteristic zero whose amenable radical is not a direct factor, then \g
contains a subalgebra which is isomorphic to the semidirect product of sl_2 by
either a nontrivial irreducible representation or a Heisenberg group (this was
essentially due to Cowling, Dorofaeff, Seeger, and Wright). As a corollary, if
G is an algebraic group over a local field K of characteristic zero, and if its
amenable radical is not, up to isogeny, a direct factor, then G(K) has Property
(T) relative to a noncompact subgroup. In particular, G(K) does not have
Haagerup's property. This extends a similar result of Cherix, Cowling and
Valette for connected Lie groups, to which our method also applies.
  We give some other applications. We provide a characterization of connected
Lie groups all of whose countable subgroups have Haagerup's property. We give
an example of an arithmetic lattice in a connected Lie group which does not
have Haagerup's property, but has no infinite subgroup with relative Property
(T). We also give a continuous family of pairwise non-isomorphic connected Lie

approximate the equations on this lattice in terms of the continuous equation.
At the moment, the best candidate for such an equation is the modified
non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this paper, we study the modified
non-linear Schroedinger equation, which arises as continuous equation in a
system describing an excitation on a hexagonal lattice. This latter system can
e.g. describe electron-phonon interaction on fullerene related structures such
as the buckminster fullerene and nanotubes. Solutions of this modified
non-linear Schroedinger equation, which have solitonic character, can be
constructed using an Ansatz for the wave function, which has time and azimuthal
angle dependence introduced previously in the study of spinning boson stars and
Q-balls. We study these solutions on a sphere, a disc and on a cylinder.
  Our construction suggests that non-spinning as well as spinning solutions,
which have a wave function with an arbitrary number of nodes, exist. We find
that this property is closely related to the series of well-known mathematical
functions, namely the Legendre functions when studying the equation on a
sphere, the Bessel functions when studying the equation on a disc and the
trigonometric functions, respectively, when studying the equation on a

transversal to the flow we compute the beam current and profile by a

consequent stretching of chemical bonds, we here study bond stretching in the,

whether substantial bond stretching (but constrained to uniform scaling on all
bonds) can result in a transition from ring current behaviour, characteristic
say of benzene at its equilibrium geometry, to localized pi-electrons on Si
atoms. Some calculations are also recorded on dissociation into 6 SiH radicals.
While the main studies have been carried out by unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF)
theory, the influence of electron correlation has been examined using two forms
of density functional theory. Planar Si6H6 treated by HF is bound to be
unstable, not all vibrational frequencies being real. Some buckling is then
allowed, which results in real frequencies and stability. Evidence is then
provided that the non-planar structure, as the Si-Si distance is increased,
exhibits pi-electron localization in the range 1.2-1.5 times the equilibrium
distance.

theoretical study on such clusters up to n=10, using Hartree-Fock theory, plus
low-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation corrections. To check against the above
study of Kornath et al., as a by-product we have made the same approximations
for n=6 and 8 as we have for n=10. This has led us to emphasize trends with n
through the Li_n clusters for (i) ground-state energy, (ii) HOMO-LUMO energy
gap, (iii) dissociation energy, and (iv) Hartree-Fock eigenvalue sum. The role
of electron correlation in distinguishing between low-lying isomers is plainly
crucial, and will need a combination of experiment and theory to obtain
decisive results such as that of Kornath et al. for Li_8. In particular, it is
shown that Hartree-Fock theory plus bond order correlations does account for
the experimentally observed symmetry T_d symmetry for Li_8.
