sources have allowed the determination of the rest-frame 2-8 keV luminosity as
a function of redshift. In addition, an analysis of the HEAO1 A2 2-10 keV
full-sky map of the X-ray background (XRB) reveals clustering on the scale of
several degrees. Combining these two results in the context of the currently
favored Lambda-CDM cosmological model implies an average X-ray bias factor,
b_x, of b_x^2 = 1.12 +- 0.33, i.e., b_x = 1.06 +- 0.16. These error estimates
include only statistical error; the systematic error sources, while comparable,
appear to be sub-dominant. This result is in contrast to the large biases of
some previous estimates and is more in line with current estimates of the
optical bias of L* galaxies.

specifically tailored to investigate the statistics of these mass-selected

galaxy clusters can be determined tomographically, by using photometric
redshifts of background source galaxies. We quantify the errors in the
tomographic redshifts, and study their dependence on mass, redshift, detection
significance, and filtering scheme. A Tomographic Matched Filtering (TMF)
scheme, which combines tomography and matched filtering, is introduced, which
optimally detects clusters of galaxies in weak lensing surveys. The TMF
exploits the extra information provided by photometric redshifts of background
source galaxies, neglected in previous studies, to optimally weight the
sources. The efficacy and reliability of the TMF is investigated using a large
ensemble of mock observations from our simulations and detailed comparisons are
made to other filters. Using photometric redshift information with the TMF
enhances the number of clusters detected with S/N > 4.5 by as much as 76%, and
it increases the dynamic range of weak lensing searches for clusters, detecting
more high redshift clusters and extending the mass sensitivity down to the
scale of large groups. Furthermore, we find that coarsely binning source
galaxies in as few as three redshift bins is sufficient to realize the gains of
the TMF. Thus, the tomographic filtering techniques presented here can be
applied to current ground based weak lensing data in as few as three bands.
Cosmological applications of mass selected cluster samples are also discussed.

be mimicked by adopting a lower gravity in our prescription of the density

we present results from a similar survey carried out on the Millennium Galaxy

this strip ranges from 0.7:1 to, at most, 6:1, corresponding to a flat

consistent with that expected from charge exchange emission between the highly

Hubble Deep Field North. The X-ray enhancement is concurrent with an
enhancement in the solar wind measured by ACE, Wind, and SoHO spacecraft. The
solar wind enhancement reaches a flux level an order of magnitude more intense
than typical fluxes at 1 AU, and has a significantly enhanced O^{+7}/O^{+6}

asymptotic motion of the electrons is determined by the different potential

La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$FeO$_3$ by {\it in-situ} photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and
x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements. The Fe 2$p$ and valence-band
PES spectra and the O $1s$ XAS spectra of LaFeO$_3$ have been successfully
reproduced by configuration-interaction cluster-model calculation and, except
for the satellite structure, by band-structure calculation.From the shift of
the binding energies of core levels, the chemical potential was found to be
shifted downward as $x$ was increased. Among the three peaks in the
valence-band spectra of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$FeO$_3$, the peak nearest to the Fermi
level ($E_F$), due to the ``$e_{g}$ band'', was found to move toward $E_F$ and
became weaker as $x$ was increased, whereas the intensity of the peak just
above $E_F$ in the O $1s$ XAS spectra increased with $x$. The gap or pseudogap
at $E_F$ was seen for all values of $x$. These results indicate that changes in
the spectral line shape around $E_F$ are dominated by spectral weight transfer
from below to above $E_F$ across the gap and are therefore highly
non-rigid-band-like.

  Unspecified Components","Submitted to FSE'04",,,,"cs.SE cs.LO",,"  Component-based software development has posed a serious challenge to system
verification since externally-obtained components could be a new source of
system failures. This issue can not be completely solved by either
model-checking or traditional software testing techniques alone due to several
reasons:
  1) externally obtained components are usually unspecified/partially
specified; 2)it is generally difficult to establish an adequacy criteria for
testing a component; 3)components may be used to dynamically upgrade a system.
  This paper introduces a new approach (called {\em model-checking driven
black-box testing}) that combines model-checking with traditional black-box
software testing to tackle the problem in a complete, sound, and automatic way.
  The idea is to, with respect to some requirement (expressed in CTL or LTL)
about the system, use model-checking techniques to derive a condition
(expressed in communication graphs) for an unspecified component such that the
system satisfies the requirement iff the condition is satisfied by the
component, and which can be established by testing the component with test
cases generated from the condition on-the-fly. In this paper, we present
model-checking driven black-box testing algorithms to handle both CTL and LTL
requirements.
  We also illustrate the idea through some examples.

oscillations. One important question is to understand to which extend can the
supernova and the neutrino physics be decoupled in the observation of a single
supernova. In this paper we discuss the possibility to probe the neutrino
mixing angle \th13 and the type of mass hierarchy from the detection of
supernova neutrinos with a liquid argon TPC detector. Moreover, describing the
supernova neutrino emission by a set of five parameters (average energy of the
different neutrino flavors, their relative luminosity and the total supernova
binding energy), we quantitatively study how it is possible to constrain these
parameters. A characteristic feature of the liquid argon TPC is the
accessibility to four independent detection channels ((1) elastic scattering
off electrons, (2) charged neutrino and (3) antineutrino and (4) neutral
currents on argon nuclei) which have different sensitivities to
electron-neutrino, anti-electron-neutrino and other neutrino flavors (muon and

diagram, named here lambda-irreducible, has a distinct topology which is
irrelevant for the b -> s gamma amplitude at one-loop and has thus a negligible
effect on the one-photon decay B -> X_s gamma. We show that the
lambda-irreducible RPV diagram can give BR(B_s -> gamma gamma) ~ 5*10^(-6) and
BR(B -> X_s gamma gamma) ~ 6*10^(-7), which is about 16 and 5 times larger than
the SM values, respectively. Although the enhancement to the decay width of B
-> X_s gamma gamma is not that dramatic, we find that the energy distribution
of the two photons is appreciably different from the SM, due to new threshold
effects caused by the distinct topology of the RPV lambda-irreducible diagram.
Moreover, this diagram significantly changes the forward-backward asymmetry
with respect to the softer photon in B -> X_s gamma gamma. Thus, the RPV effect
in B -> X_s gamma gamma can be discerned using these observables.

sneutrino, a massive right-handed (RH) sneutrino associated with the see-saw
mechanism of Majorana neutrino masses, to play the role of the curvaton.
Planck-scale suppressed non-renormalizable terms in the RH neutrino
superpotential must be eliminated to a high order if the RH sneutrino curvaton
is to dominate the energy density before it decays, which can be achieved via
an R-symmetry which is broken to R-parity by the Giudice-Maseiro mechanism. In
order to satisfy the thermalization constraint, one RH neutrino mass eigenstate
must have small Yukawa couplings to the Higgs and lepton doublets,
corresponding to a lightest neutrino mass m_{nu_{1}} < 10^{-3} eV. A
time-dependent lepton asymmetry will be induced in the RH sneutrino condensate
by the Affleck-Dine mechanism driven by SUSY breaking B-terms associated with
the RH neutrino masses. Requiring that the resulting baryon asymmetry and
isocurvature perturbations are acceptably small imposes an upper bound on the
RH neutrino mass. We show that a scenario consistent with all constraints is
obtained for a RH neutrino mass in the range 10^{2} - 10^{4} GeV when the RH
sneutrino decay temperature is greater than 100 GeV and lightest neutrino mass
m_{nu_{1}} approx 10^{-3} GeV. Larger RH neutrino masses are possible for
smaller m_{nu_{1}}. The resulting scenario is generally consistent with a
solution of the cosmic string problem of D-term inflation.

A.N.Dranishnikov \cite {D$_5$} in the context of compact spaces and CW

$SP(L)$. One of the main ideas of the paper is to treat $\ExD(X)\leq SP(L)$ as
the fundamental concept of cohomological dimension theory instead of
$\dim_G(X)\leq n$. In a subsequent paper \cite{Dy$_6$} we show how properties
of infinite symmetric products lead naturally to a calculus of graded groups
which implies most of classical results of the cohomological dimension. The
basic notion in \cite{Dy$_6$} is that of homological dimension of a graded
group which allows for simultanous treatment of cohomological dimension of
compacta and extension properties of CW complexes. We introduce cohomology of
$X$ with respect to $L$ (defined as homotopy groups of the function space
$SP(L)^X$).
  As an application of our results we characterize all countable groups $G$ so
that the Moore space $M(G,n)$ is of the same extension type as the
Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(G,n)$. Another application is characterization of
infinite symmetric products of the same extension type as a compact (or
finite-dimensional and countable) CW complex.

group Ham(M,\om) of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of a closed symplectic

\pi_1(\Ham(M,\om)) in the units of the quantum homology ring. We show that if
the weights of the action at the points at which the moment map is a maximum
are sufficiently small then the circle represents a nonzero element of
\pi_1(\Ham(M,\om)). Further, if the isotropy has order at most two and the
circle contracts in \Ham(M,\om) then the homology of M is invariant under an
involution. For example, the image of the normalized moment map is a symmetric
interval [-a,a]. If the action is semifree (i.e. the isotropy weights are 0 or
+/- 1) then we calculate the leading order term in the Seidel representation,
an important technical tool in understanding the quantum cohomology of
manifolds that admit semifree Hamiltonian circle actions. If the manifold is
toric, we use our results about this representation to describe the basic
multiplicative structure of the quantum cohomology ring of an arbitrary toric
manifold. There are two important technical ingredients; one relates the
equivariant cohomology of $M$ to the Morse flow of the moment map, and the

quantum probability amplitudes in a path-integral formalism. We find that this
radius is substantially smaller than the HBT radius extracted from the

deformations of the membrane to create spherical or tubular buds. While the
basic physical properties of homogeneous membranes are relatively well-known,
the effects of inhomogeneities within membranes are very much an active field
of study. Membrane domains enriched in certain lipids in particular are
attracting much attention, and in this Letter we investigate the effect of such
domains on the shape and fate of membrane tubes. Recent experiments have
demonstrated that forced lipid phase separation can trigger tube fission, and
we demonstrate how this can be understood purely from the difference in elastic
constants between the domains. Moreover, the proposed model predicts timescales
for fission that agree well with experimental findings.

pre-exponential factor $A(q,\theta)$ in the integrand of this integral

the problem is identified: the standard unitarity condition invoked in
semiclassical transformation theory does not fix adequately in $A(q,\theta)$ a
factor which is a function of the action $J$ written in terms of $q$ and
$\theta$. A prescription for an improved choice of this factor, based on
succesfully reproducing the leading behaviour of wave functions in the vicinity
of potential minima, is outlined. Exact evaluation of the modified integral
representation via the Residue Theorem is possible. It yields wave functions
which are not, in general, orthogonal. However, closed-form results obtained
after Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization bear a striking resemblance to the exact
