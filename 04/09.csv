"astro-ph/0404169","Martin Weinberg","Martin D. Weinberg","Time-dependent secular evolution in galaxies","15 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs (1972) presented a useful formula for computing the
long-range torque between spiral arms and the disk at large. The derivation
uses second-order perturbation theory and assumes that the perturbation slowly
grows over a very long time: the time-asymptotic limit. This formula has been
widely used to predict the angular momentum transport between spiral arms and
stellar bars between disks and dark-matter halos. However, this paper shows
that the LBK time-asymptotic limit is not appropriate because the
characteristic evolution time for galaxies is too close to the relevant
dynamical times. We demonstrate that transients, not present in the
time-asymptotic formula, can play a major role in the evolution for realistic
astronomical time scales. A generalisation for arbitrary time dependence is
presented and illustrated by the bar--halo and satellite--halo interaction. The
natural time dependence in bar-driven halo evolution causes quantitative
differences in the overall torque and qualitative differences in the physical-
and phase-space location of angular momentum transfer. The time-dependent
theory predicts that four principal resonances dominate the torque at different
times and accurately predicts the results of an N-body simulation. In addition,
we show that the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) is responsible for the peak
angular momentum exchange but, due to the time dependence, the changes occur
over a broad range of energies, radii and frequencies. We describe the
implication of these findings for the satellite--halo interaction using a
simple model and end with a discussion of possible impact on other aspects
secular galaxy evolution.

IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. The 3-2/7-6 line luminosity ratio is about
1/3 indicating the presence of warm and dense molecular gas with an estimated

density of 4.0x10^25 W Hz^-1. The radio to far-infrared ratio, q, has a value
of 2.0 which is consistent with the values found in star forming galaxies. At
the 30 mas resolution of the VLBA, J1409+5628 is not detected with a 4 sigma
upper limit to the surface brightness of 0.29 mJy beam^-1. This implies a limit
to the intrinsic brightness temperature of 2x10^5 K at 8 GHz, typical for
nuclear starbursts and two or more orders of magnitude weaker than typical
radio-loud active galactic nuclei. Both the properties of the CO line emission

  In J1409+5628 young massive stars are the dominant source of dust heating,
accounting for most of the infrared luminosity, and the massive reservoir of
molecular gas can sustain the star formation rate of a few 1000 \Msun yr^-1

grew via a combination of accretion and mergers between pre-existing seed BHs

v(esc) < v(kick) disrupt the BH growth process. Our results suggest that under

ambient radiation field. The pumping is dominated by the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). It is usual in molecular line radiative transfer modelling to
simply assume that this is the only incident radiation field. In this paper, a
molecular line transport code and a dust radiative transfer code are used to
explore the effects of the inclusion of a full interstellar radiation field
(ISRF) on a simple test molecular cloud. It is found that in many galactic
situations, the shape and strength of the line profiles that result are robust
to variations in the ISRF and thus that in most cases, it is safe to adopt the
CMB radiation field for the molecular line transport calculations. However, we
show that in two examples, the inclusion of a plausible radiation field can
have a significant effect on the the line profiles. Firstly, in the vicinity of
an embedded massive star, there will be an enhanced far infared component to
the radiation field. Secondly, for molecular clouds at large redshift, the CMB
temperature increases and this of course also alters the radiation field. In
both of these cases, the line profiles are weakened significantly compared to a
cloud exposed to a standard radiation field. Therefore this effect should be
accounted for when investigating prestellar cores in massive star forming
regions and when searching for molecular clouds at high redshift.

fortuitously covers the first rebrightening and allows determination of the

seen that the rebrightening is a change from a neutral disk (T~7000K) to an

release, is the same which reproduces the dynamical properties of the SNR and
the spectral characteristics of the emission produced by CRs. The extremely
small spatial scales in the observed morphological structures at hard X-ray
energies are due to a large effective magnetic field $B_d \sim 500$ $\mu$G in
the interior which is at the same time not only required but also sufficient to
achieve the excellent agreement between the spatially integrated radio and
X-ray synchrotron spectra and their calculated form. The only reasonably
thinkable condition for the production of such a large effective field strength

angular power spectrum excluding these areas gives a slightly higher first
Doppler peak amplitude. Finally, we probe the isotropy of the largest angular
scales by estimating the power spectrum on hemispheres and reconfirm strong
indications of a north-south asymmetry previously reported by other authors. We
find tentative evidence for residual foregrounds in the range l=2-4, which
could be associated with the low measured quadrupole amplitudes and other
anomalies on these angular scales. However, over the range l=5-40 the observed
asymmetry is much harder to explain in terms of residual foregrounds and known
systematic effects. Such asymmetric distributions of power on the sky provide a
serious test for the cosmological principle of isotropy.

couplings, only the Cartan subalgebra is manifest as a global symmetry.
Superpotentials for these models are constructed using global symmetry
invariants as their building blocks. Higgsings connecting theories for
different del Pezzos are immediately identified by performing the appropriate
higgsing of the global symmetry groups. The symmetric properties of the quivers
are also exploited to count the first few dibaryon operators in the gauge
theories, matching their enumeration in the AdS duals.

to be the correct framework for a generalized reconstruction theorem amenable

the interesting result that a large class of quantum theories are expected to

single-scale random velocity field. We show that if there is a separation
between the flow scale k_flow^{-1} and the box size k_box^{-1}, the decay rate
lambda ~ (k_box/k_flow)^2 is determined by the turbulent diffusion of the
box-scale mode. Exponential decay at the rate lambda is preceded by a transient
powerlike decay (the total scalar variance ~ t^{-5/2} if the Corrsin invariant
is zero, t^{-3/2} otherwise) that lasts a time t~1/\lambda. Spectra are sharply
peaked at k=k_box. The box-scale peak acts as a slowly decaying source to a
secondary peak at the flow scale. The variance spectrum at scales intermediate
between the two peaks (k_box<<k<<k_flow) is ~ k + a k^2 + ... (a>0). The mixing
of the flow-scale modes by the random flow produces, for the case of large
Peclet number, a k^{-1+delta} spectrum at k>>k_flow, where delta ~ lambda is a
small correction. Our solution thus elucidates the spectral make up of the
``strange mode,'' combining small-scale structure and a decay law set by the
largest scales.

addition to ordinary nucleons contain a few antibaryons (antiproton,
antilambda, etc.). The properties of such systems are described within the
relativistic mean-field model by employing G-parity transformed interactions
for antibaryons. Calculations are first done for infinite systems and then for
finite nuclei from He to Pb. It is demonstrated that the presence of a real
antibaryon leads to a strong rearrangement of a target nucleus resulting in a
significant increase of its binding energy and local compression. Noticeable
effects remain even after the antibaryon coupling constants are reduced by
factor 3-4 compared to G-parity motivated values. We have performed detailed
calculations of the antibaryon annihilation rates in the nuclear environment by
applying a kinetic approach. It is shown that due to significant reduction of
the reaction Q-values, the in-medium annihilation rates should be strongly
suppressed leading to relatively long-lived antibaryon-nucleus systems.
Multi-nucleon annihilation channels are analyzed too. We have also estimated
formation probabilities of bound antibaryon-nucleus systems in
antiproton-nucleus reactions and have found that their observation will be
feasible at the future GSI antiproton facility. Several observable signatures
are proposed. The possibility of producing multi-quark-antiquark clusters is
discussed.

({\it J. Phys. B.}, 22, 3791--3814, 1989) which is a mean-field theory deduced
from no-photon QED. The associated functional is bounded from below. In the
presence of an external field, a minimizer, if it exists, is interpreted as the
polarized vacuum and it solves a self-consistent equation.
  In a recent paper math-ph/0403005, we proved the convergence of the iterative
fixed-point scheme naturally associated with this equation to a global
minimizer of the BDF functional, under some restrictive conditions on the
external potential, the ultraviolet cut-off $\Lambda$ and the bare fine
structure constant $\alpha$. In the present work, we improve this result by
showing the existence of the minimizer by a variational method, for any cut-off
$\Lambda$ and without any constraint on the external field.
  We also study the behaviour of the minimizer as $\Lambda$ goes to infinity
and show that the theory is ""nullified"" in that limit, as predicted first by
Landau: the vacuum totally kills the external potential. Therefore the limit
case of an infinite cut-off makes no sense both from a physical and
mathematical point of view.
  Finally, we perform a charge and density renormalization scheme applying
simultaneously to all orders of the fine structure constant $\alpha$, on a
simplified model where the exchange term is neglected.
