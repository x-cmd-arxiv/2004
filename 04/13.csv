neural networks. Here, we present two neural networks for the identification of
microlensing events -- the first discriminates against variable stars and the
second against supernovae. The inputs to the networks include parameters
describing the shape and the size of the lightcurve, together with colour of
the event. The network computes the posterior probability of microlensing,
together with an estimate of the likely error. An algorithm is devised for
direct calculation of the microlensing rate from the output of the neural
networks. We present a new analysis of the microlensing candidates towards the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The neural networks confirm the microlensing
nature of only 7 of the possible 17 events identified by the MACHO experiment.
This suggests that earlier estimates of the microlensing optical depth towards
the LMC may have been overestimated. A smaller number of events is consistent
with the assumption that all the microlensing events are caused by the known
stellar populations in the outer Galaxy/LMC.

large enough to contain essentially all phenomena that can be conceivably
measured. The initial time is taken as the epoch when the lowest CMB modes
undergo horizon crossing, and the final time taken when the wavelengths of CMB
photons are comparable with the Hubble scale, i.e. with the nominal size of the
universe. This allows the definition of a local ensemble of similarly
constructed universes, using only modest extrapolations of the observed
behavior of the cosmos. We then assume that further out in spacetime, similar
universes can be constructed but containing different standard model
parameters. Within this multiverse ensemble, it is assumed that the standard
model parameters are strongly correlated with size, i.e. with the value of the
inverse Hubble parameter at the final time, in a manner as previously
suggested. This allows an estimate of the range of sizes which allow life as we
know it, and invites a speculation regarding the most natural distribution of
sizes. If small sizes are favored, this in turn allows some understanding of
the hierarchy problems of particle physics. Subsequent sections of the paper
explore other possible implications. In all cases, the approach is as bottoms
up and as phenomenological as possible, and suggests that theories of the

provide the observed accretion rates from gravitational radiation losses alone.
Such systems are predicted to be formed in the dense GC environment, a
hypothesis supported by the 11.4 minute binary 4U 1820-30, the brightest
persistent LMXB in a Galactic GC. These binaries have short enough lifetimes
(less then 3 Myr) while bright that we calculate their luminosity function
under a steady-state approximation. This yields a luminosity function slope in
agreement with that observed for luminosities in the range of 6E37 ergs/sec to
5E38 ergs/sec, encouraging us to use the observed numbers of LMXBs per GC mass
to calculate the accumulated number of ultracompact binaries. For a constant
birthrate over 8 Gyrs, the number of ultracompact binaries which have evolved
through this bright phase is nearly 4000 in a 10 million solar mass GC,
consistent with dynamical interaction calculations. Perhaps most importantly,
if all ultracompacts become millisecond radio pulsars, then the observed

are elongated because they are highly inclined, alignment of the slit and major
axis should maximize the observed velocity and reveal velocity shear, if
present. In spite of this alignment, we see spatially resolved velocity shear
in only two galaxies. We show that the seeing makes a large difference in the
observed velocity spread of a tilted emission line, and use this information to
place limits on the velocity spread of the ionized gas of the galaxies in the

velocity shear (half of the velocity range of a tilted emission line) that
would be observed under our best seeing conditions of ~0.5"". When combined with
previous work, our data also indicate that aligning the slit along the major
axis does not increase the probability of observing a tilted emission line. We
then focus on the one-dimensional velocity dispersion \sigma, which is much
less affected by the seeing, and see that the elongated subsample exhibits a
significantly lower velocity dispersion than galaxies selected at random from
our total H-alpha sample, not higher as one might have expected. We also see
some evidence that the elongated galaxies are less reddened than those randomly
selected using only UV colors. Both of these results are counter to what would
be expected if the elongated galaxies were highly inclined disks. It is at
least as likely that the galaxies' elongated morphologies are due to merging
subunits.

increase of the Sc+Sd+dI galaxy density which can be modeled as either
n(z)~1+3(z-0.15) or n(z) ~ (1+z)^2 using the currently favored cosmological
parameters Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_Lambda=0.7, with an uncertainty in both
evolution rates of order of unity. For Omega_m=1.0 and Omega_Lambda=0.0, the
linear and power-law evolution rates are 4 and 2.5 resp. Both models yield a
good match to the ESS BVRc redshift distributions to 21-22 mag and to the
number-counts to 23-23.5 mag, which probe the galaxy distribution to redshifts
z~0.5 and z~1.0 resp. This analysis illustrates how Gaussian+Schechter
composite luminosity functions provide more robust constraints on the evolution
rate than pure Schechter functions. The detected density evolution indicates
that mergers could play a significant role in the evolution of late-type Spiral
and dwarf Irregular galaxies. However, the ESO-Sculptor density increase with
redshift could also be caused by a ~1 mag brightening of the Sc+Sd+dI galaxies
at z~0.5 and a ~1.5-2.0 mag brightening at z~1, which is compatible with the
expected passive brightening of Sc galaxies at these redshifts. Distinguishing
between luminosity and density evolution is a major difficulty as these produce
the same effect on the redshift and magnitude distributions. The detected
evolution rate of the ESO-Sculptor Sc+Sd+dI galaxies is nevertheless among the
range of measured values from the other existing analyses, whether they provide

their number? Why are their orbits nearly circular and coplanar? How long did
they take to form? Runaway accretion in a disk of small bodies resulted in a
tiny fraction of the bodies growing much larger than all the others. This was
followed by oligarchic growth during which the big bodies maintained similar
masses and uniformly spaced semi-major axes. We depart from standard treatments
of planet formation by assuming that as the big bodies got bigger, the small
ones got smaller as the result of undergoing a collisional fragmentation
cascade. It follows that oligarchy was a brief stage in solar system evolution.
When the oligarchs' surface mass density matched that of the small bodies,
dynamical friction was no longer able to balance viscous stirring, so their
velocity dispersion increased to the extent that their orbits crossed. This
marked the end of oligarchy. What happened next differed in the inner and outer
parts of the planetary system. In the inner part, where the ratios of the
escape velocities from the surfaces of the planets to the escape velocities
from their orbits are smaller than unity, big bodies collided and coalesced
after their random velocities became comparable to their escape velocities. In
the outer part, where these ratios are larger than unity, the random velocities
of some of the big bodies continued to rise until they were ejected. In both
parts, the number density of the big bodies eventually decreased to the extent
that gravitational interactions among them no longer produced large scale
chaos. After that their orbital eccentricities and inclinations were damped by

actively accreting onto the dark halo. The winds effectively carry energy from
the dense, dusty environment of a starburst into lower density regions, where
the escape probability for Ly-a photons is greater. ELS emission is expected to
be considerably more clumpy (<100 pc; ~0.01"") than CSR emission. For a

modelling of the SiO line emission has been performed, and the comparison
between observations and models are conducted in the visibility plane,
maximizing the sensitivity. The excitation analysis suggests that the abundance
of SiO is as high as 4E-5 in the inner part of the wind, close to the predicted
values from stellar atmosphere models. Beyond a radius of ~ 1E15 cm the SiO
abundance is significantly lower, about 3E-6, until it decreases strongly at a

freezes out onto dust grains, and then eventually becomes photodissociated by
the interstellar UV-radiation field. In these low expansion velocity sources
the turbulent broadening of the lines plays an important role in the line
formation. Micro-turbulent velocity widths in the range 1.1-1.5 km/s result in
a very good reproduction of the observed line shapes even if the gas expansion
velocity is kept constant. This, combined with the fact that the SiO and CO

successive moments with respect to the line of sight velocity component,
focusing on the zeroth (intensity or integrated emission I) and first
(non-normalized velocity centroid C) moments. The ratio of the latter to the
former is the normalized centroid C_0, whose expression can be linearized for
small density fluctuations. To describe the statistics of I, C and C_0, we
derive expansions of their autocorrelation functions in powers of density
fluctuations and perform a lowest-order real-space calculation of their scaling
behaviour, assuming that the density and velocity fields are fractional

actually not be the best way to remove the influence of density fluctuations.

ISM is modeled as a two-phase medium in pressure equilibrium. The remnants of
exploding type II SNe percolate into super-bubbles (SBs) that sweep the ISM,
heating the hot phase (if the SB is adiabatic) or cooling it (in the snowplow
stage, when the interior gas of the SB has cooled). The resulting feedback
regimes occur in well-defined regions of the space defined by vertical
scale-length and surface density of the structure. When SBs blow out in the
adiabatic regime, the efficiency of SNe in heating the ISM is ~5 per cent, with
\~80 per cent of the energy budget injected into the external halo, and the
outcoming ISM is self-regulated to a state similar to that found in the Milky
Way. Feedback is most efficient when SBs are pressure-confined in the adiabatic
regime. In some significant regions of the parameter space confinement takes
place in the snowplow stage; then the hot phase has a lower temperature and
star formation is quicker. In some critical cases, the hot phase is strongly
depleted and the cold phase percolates the whole volume, giving rise to a
sudden burst of star formation. Strong galactic winds are predicted to happen
only in critical cases. This model provides a starting point for constructing a
realistic grid of feedback solutions to be used in galaxy formation codes. The
predictive power of this model extends to many properties of the ISM, so that
most parameters can be constrained by reproducing the main properties of the

For this study, we developed a time-dependent chemical model with up-to-date
reaction rate coefficients. We ran several cases, using different realistic
chemical compositions for the grain mantles and for the gas prior to mantle
evaporation. The modeling shows that S-bearing molecular ratios depend very
critically on the gas temperature and density, the abundance of atomic oxygen,
and, most importantly, on the form of sulphur injected in the gas phase, which
is very poorly known. Consequently, ratios of S-bearing molecules cannot be
easily used as chemical clocks. However, detailed observations and careful
modeling of both physical and chemical structure can give hints on the source
age and constrain the mantle composition (i.e. the form of sulphur in cold

>10 Gyr old, including main sequence turn-offs at V~23 and well populated HBs.
We use the CMDs to obtain metallicity and reddening estimates for each cluster.
NGC 1939 is a metal poor cluster, with [Fe/H] = -2.10 +/- 0.19, while NGC 1928

LMC globular clusters therefore now numbers 15 plus the unique, somewhat
younger cluster ESO121-SC03. The NGC 1939 field contains another cluster in the

Rosseland angular radii are derived from the measured visibilities by fitting
theoretical visibility functions obtained from center-to-limb intensity
variations (CLVs) of Mira star models (Bessel et al. 1996, Hofmann et al. 1998,
Tej et al. 2003). Using the derived Rosseland angular radii and the SEDs
reconstructed from available photometric and spectrophotometric data, we find
effective temperatures ranging from T_eff=3192 +/- 200 K at phase phi=0.13 to
2918 +/- 183 K at phi=0.26. Comparison of these Rosseland radii, effective
temperatures, and the shape of the observed visibility functions with model
predictions suggests that o Cet is a fundamental mode pulsator. Furthermore, we
investigated the variation of visibility function and diameter with phase. The
Rosseland angular diameter of o Cet increased from 28.9 +/- 0.3 mas
(corresponding to a Rosseland radius of 332 +/- 38 R_sun for a distance of
D=107 +/- 12 pc) at phi=0.13 to 34.9 +/- 0.4 mas (402 +/- 46 R_sun) at phi=0.4.
The error of the Rosseland linear radius almost entirely results from the error
of the parallax, since the error of the angular diameter is only approximately
1 %.

self-gravitating systems. We show the correspondance between statistical
mechanics methods based on the evaluation of the density of states and
partition function and thermodynamical methods based on the maximization of a
thermodynamical potential (entropy or free energy). We address the question of
the thermodynamic limit of self-gravitating systems, the justification of the
mean-field approximation, the validity of the saddle point approximation near
the transition point, the lifetime of metastable states and the fluctuations in
isothermal spheres. In particular, we emphasize the tremendously long lifetime
of metastable states of self-gravitating systems which increases exponentially
with the number of particles N except in the vicinity of the critical point.
More specifically, using an adaptation of the Kramers formula justified by a
kinetic theory, we show that the lifetime of a metastable state scales as e^{N
Delta s} in microcanonical ensemble and e^{N Delta j} in canonical ensemble,
where Delta s and Delta j are the barriers of entropy and free energy j=s-beta
epsilon (per particle) respectively. The physical caloric curve must take these
metastable states (local entropy maxima) into account. As a result, it becomes
multi-valued and leads to microcanonical phase transitions and ``dinosaur's
necks''(Chavanis 2002b, Chavanis & Rieutord 2003). The consideration of
metastable states answers the critics raised by D.H.E. Gross [cond-mat/0307535;

model with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
interactions between the local moments. The Heisenberg interactions are
periodically arranged in a Villain configuration in two dimensions with
nearest-neighbor, ferromagnetic coupling $J$ and antiferromagnetic coupling
$-\eta J$. This model is solved at zero temperature by performing a
$1/\sqrt{S}$ expansion in the rotated reference frame of each local moment.
When $\eta $ exceeds a critical value, the ground state is a magnetically
frustrated, canted antiferromagnet. With increasing hopping energy $t$ or
magnetic field $B$, the local moments become aligned and the ferromagnetic
phase is stabilized above critical values of $t$ or $B$. In the canted phase, a
charge-density wave forms because the electrons prefer to sit on lines of sites
that are coupled ferromagnetically. Due to a change in the topology of the
Fermi surface from closed to open, phase separation occurs in a narrow range of
parameters in the canted phase. In zero field, the long-wavelength spin waves
are isotropic in the region of phase separation. Whereas the average spin-wave
stiffness in the canted phase increases with $t$ or $\eta $, it exhibits a more
complicated dependence on field. This work strongly suggests that the jump in
the spin-wave stiffness observed in Pr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$ with $0.3 \le x \le
0.4$ at a field of 3 T is caused by the delocalization of the electrons rather
than by the alignment of the antiferromagnetic regions.

holds also out of equilibrium provided that the system is in a stationary state

measurement at zero temperature, in which the impedance matching is maintained
while driving a mesoscopic sample out of equilibrium, it is the nonsymmetrized
noise power spectrum which is measured, even if the bare measurement, i.e.
without extracting the excess part of the noise, obtains the symmetrized noise.
As a second application we derive a commutation relation for the two components
of fermionic or bosonic currents which holds in every stationary state and
which is a generalization of the one valid only for bosonic currents. As is
usually the case, such a commutation relation can be used e.g. to derive
Heisenberg uncertainty relationships among these current components.

discontinuous transition to two convective rolls, with hysteretic behavior. At
fixed inelasticity and increasing gravity, a transition from no convection to
one roll can be evidenced. If the gravity is further increased, the roll is
eventually suppressed. Increasing the number of monolayers the system
eventually localizes mostly at the bottom of the box: in this case multiple
convective rolls as well as surface waves appear. We analyze the density and

ARPES, tunnelling measurements, isotope effect and etc. They give convincing
evidence that the EPI is strong and dominantly contributes to pairing in HTSC
oxides. It is argued that strong electronic correlations in conjunction with
the pronounced (in relatively weakly screened materials) EPI are unavoidable
ingredients for the microscopic theory of pairing in HTSC oxides. I present the
well defined and controllable theory of strong correlations and the EPI. It is
shown that strong correlations give rise to the pronounced \textit{forward
scattering peak} in the EPI - the FSP theory. The FSP theory explains in a
consistent way several (crucial) puzzles such as much smaller transport
coupling constant than the pairing one ($\lambda_{tr}\ll \lambda$), which are
present if one interprets the results in HTSC oxides by the old
Migdal-Eliashberg theory for the EPI. The ARPES shift puzzle where the nodal
kink at 70 meV is unshifted in the superconducting state, while the anti-nodal
one at 40 meV is shifted can be explained at present only by the FSP theory. A

straightforward analysis of the ionic trajectories shows that lithium diffusion
results from jumps between sites that are basically unmodified on the time
scale of the lithium ionic relaxation. This allows us a detailed identification
and characterization of the sites. The results indicate that the number of
lithium sites is only slightly bigger than the number of lithium ions so that
the fraction of vacant sites is very limited at every instant. Mapping the
ionic trajectories onto series of jumps between the sites provides direct
access to lithium jump dynamics. For each site, we determine the mean residence
time $\tau_s$ and the probability $p_s^b$ that a jump from this site to another
site is followed by a direct backjump. While a broad distribution $G(\lg
\tau_s)$ shows that different sites feature diverse lithium dynamics, high
values of $p_s^b$ give direct evidence for back-and-forth jumps. We further
study how the local glass structure and the local energy landscape affect
lithium jump dynamics. We observe substantial effects due to the energy
landscape, which are difficult to capture within single-particle approaches.

yields discretizations that are consistent, in the sense that the constraints
and evolution equations can be solved simultaneously, but it cannot be
considered mimetic since it achieves consistency by determining the Lagrange
multipliers. In this paper we would like to show that when applied to general
relativity linearized around a Minkowski background the technique yields a
discretization that is mimetic in the traditional sense of the word. We show
this using the traditional metric variables and also the Ashtekar new

suggest that the new discretization scheme can provide an alternative that is
nevertheless close in spirit to the traditional mimetic formulations.

particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime and find that it deviates by 50% from
the Schwarzschild result at the innermost stable circular orbit of
Schwarzschild, if the ADM mass at each puncture is used to define the local
black hole masses.

with no continuous symmetries, most 3+1 finite differencing codes use a
Cartesian grid. It's difficult to do excision on such a grid, because the
natural $r = \text{constant}$ excision surface must be approximated either by a
very different shape such as a contained cube, or by an irregular and
non-smooth ""LEGO(tm) sphere"" which may introduce numerical instabilities into
the evolution. In this paper I describe an alternate scheme, which uses
multiple $\{r \times (\text{angular coordinates}) \}$ grid patches, each patch
using a different (nonsingular) choice of angular coordinates. This allows
excision on a smooth $r = \text{constant}$ 2-sphere.
  I discuss the key design choices in such a multiple-patch scheme, including
the choice of ghost-zone versus internal-boundary treatment of the interpatch
boundaries, the number and shape of the patches, the details of how the ghost
zones are ""synchronized"" by interpolation from neighboring patches, the tensor
basis for the Einstein equations in each patch, and the handling of non-tensor
field variables such as the BSSN $\tilde{\Gamma}^i$.
  I present sample numerical results from a prototype implementation of this
scheme. This code simulates the time evolution of the (asymptotically flat)
spacetime around a single (excised) black hole, using 4th-order finite
differencing in space and time. Using Kerr initial data with $J/m^2 = 0.6$, I
present evolutions to $t \gtsim 1500m$. The lifetime of these evolutions
appears to be limited only by outer boundary instabilities, not by any excision
instabilities or by any problems inherent to the multiple-patch scheme.

function and suggested by two recent works concerning the Riemann Hypothesis:
one by Balazard, Saias and Yor and the other by Volchkov. We define an integral
m (r) involving the Zeta function in the complex variable s = r + it and find a
particurarly interesting expression for m(r) which is rigorous at least in some
range of r. In such a range we find that there are two discontinuities of the
derivative m'(r) at r = 1 and r = 0, which we calculate exactly. The jump at r
= 1 is given by 4*Pi, while that at r = 0 is given by (-4 + gamma + 3*log(2) +
Pi/2)*Pi. The validity of the expression for m(r) up to r = 1/2 is equivalent
to the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Assuming RH the expression for
m(r) gives m = 0 at r = 1/2 and the slope m'(r) = Pi*(1 + gamma) = 4.95 at r =
1/2 (where gamma = 0.577215... is the Euler constant). As a consequence, if the
expression for m(r) can be continued up to r = 1/2, then if we interpret m(r)
as the effective potential of a charged filament, in the presence of the unit
charges located at all the zeros (trivial and non trivial zeros) and at the
pole in one of the Riemann Zeta function then there is a jump of the electric

lambda_1 = [1+gamma/2-(1/2)ln(4*Pi)] = 0.0230957. We then construct a potential
well (a symmetric function around x = r+1/2 = 1) which is exact if the RH is
true. Independently of the RH, by looking at the behaviour of the convergent
Taylor expansion of m(r) at r = 1-, the value m(r = 1/2+) as well as the first
Li's coefficient may be evaluated using the Euler product formula. We give in
this way further evidence for the possible truth of the Riemann Hypothesis.

problem is underdetermined because of an unknown exit concentration. We resolve
this by defining the exit concentration as a solution to a similar diffusion
equation which satisfies a Dirichlet condition at the left end of the half
line. This problem does not appear to have been solved in the literature, and
the resulting representation should be useful for problems of practical
interest. Authors of previous works on problems of this type have eliminated
the unknown exit concentration by assuming a continuous concentration at the
outflow boundary. This yields a well-posed problem by forcing a homogeneous
Neumann exit, widely known as the Danckwerts [1] condition. We provide a
solution to the Neumann problem and use it to produce an estimate which
demonstrates that the Danckwerts condition implies a zero concentration at the
outflow boundary, even for a long flow domain and a large time.

convergence problems. In 1983, J.K. Moser and S.M. Webster provided examples of
real analytic surfaces in C^2 having an isolated hyperbolic (in the sense of E.
Bishop) complex tangency, which are formally but not holomorphically
normalizable (because of the presence of small divisors), even if the normal
form is itself real analytic or algebraic. On the contrary, it appears that
such a nonconvergence phenomenon does not appear for submanifolds of C^n whose
CR dimension is locally constant, in view of recent results by S.M. Baouendi,
P. Ebenfelt and L.P. Rothschild. These results hold true with hypotheses which
are relatively simple, but satisfied at a Zariski-generic. Notably, these
authors establish that every invertible formal CR mapping between two
submanifolds of C^n which are real analytic, generic, finitely nondegenerate
and minimal (in the sense of J.-M. Tr\'epreau and A.E. Tumanov) is convergent.
In this paper, we establish a more general convergence theorem, which is valid
without any nondegeneracy condition, and which confirms the rigidity of the CR
category (see Theorem 1.23). This result may be interpreted as a formal Schwarz
reflection principle for CR mappings. We deduce that every formal CR
equivalence between two submanifolds of C^n which are real analytic, generic
and minimal is convergent if and only if both submanifolds are holomorphically
nondegenerate (in the sense of N. Stanton). Finally, we establish that two
submanifolds of C^n which are real analytic, generic and minimal are formally
CR equivalent if and only if they are biholomorphically equivalent.

that large classes of simply connected 4-manifolds do not admit any optimal

are homeomorphic to infinitely many distinct smooth 4-manifolds on which no

structure where the propagation of opinion is asymmetric. In the normal flow of
opinion formation a high-rank agent uses its authority (or its persuasion when
necessary) to impose its opinion on others. However, agents with no authority
may only use the force of its persuasion to propagate their opinions. In this
contribution we describe a simple model with no social mobility, where each
agent belongs to a class in the hierarchy and has also a persuasion capability.
The model is studied numerically for a three levels case, and analytically
within a mean field approximation, with a very good agreement between the two
approaches. The stratum where the dominant opinion arises from is strongly
dependent on the percentage of agents in each hierarchy level, and we obtain a
phase diagram identifying the relative frequency of prevailing opinions. We
also find that the time evolution of the conflicting opinions polarizes after a

surrounded by the photonic bandgap. The heterogeneous photonic crystal
structure consists of two triangular lattices of the same lattice constant with
different air hole radii. The photonic crystal laser was realized by
room-temperature optical pumping of air-bridge slabs of InGaAsP quantum wells
emitting at 1.55 micrometer. The lasing mode was identified from its spectral
positions and polarization directions. A low threshold incident pump power of
0.24mW was achieved. The measured characteristics of the photonic crystal
lasers closely agree with the results of real space and Fourier space
calculations based on the finite-difference time-domain method.

calculation of the Casimir force between metallic plates. It allows to take
into account the nonlocal connection between the current density and electric
field inside of metals. In general, a material has to be described by two
impedances $Z_{s}(\omega,q)$ and $Z_{p}(\omega,q)$ corresponding to two
different polarization states. In contrast with the approximate Leontovich
impedance they depend not only on frequency $\omega$ but also on the wave
vector along the plate $q$. In this paper only the nonlocal effects happening
at frequencies $\omega<\omega_{p}$ (plasma frequency) are analyzed. We refer to
all of them as the anomalous skin effect. The impedances are calculated for the
propagating and evanescent fields in the Boltzmann approximation. It is found
that $Z_p$ significantly deviates from the local impedance as a result of the
Thomas-Fermi screening. The nonlocal correction to the Casimir force is
calculated at zero temperature. This correction is small but observable at
small separations between bodies. The same theory can be used to find more
significant nonlocal contribution at $\omega\sim\omega_p$ due to the plasmon
excitation.

particular family of q-polynomials, namely the Rogers-Szego polynomials. Their
main properties are presented, the associated Wigner function is calculated and
its properties are discussed. It is shown that the angle probability density
obtained from the Wigner function is a well-behaved function defined in the
interval [-Pi,Pi), while the action probability only assumes integer values
greater or equal than zero. It is emphasized the fact that the width of the
angle probability density is governed by the free parameter q characterizing
the polynomial.

the context of cooperative games of incomplete information. We give several
examples of such nonlocal games where strategies that make use of entanglement
outperform all possible classical strategies. One implication of these examples
is that entanglement can profoundly affect the soundness property of two-prover
interactive proof systems. We then establish limits on the probability with
which strategies making use of entanglement can win restricted types of
nonlocal games. These upper bounds may be regarded as generalizations of
Tsirelson-type inequalities, which place bounds on the extent to which quantum
information can allow for the violation of Bell inequalities. We also
investigate the amount of entanglement required by optimal and nearly optimal
quantum strategies for some games.

A 70, 042310 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.70.042310",,"quant-ph",,"  Superselection rules severly constrain the operations which can be
implemented on a distributed quantum system. While the restriction to local
operations and classical communication gives rise to entanglement as a nonlocal
resource, particle number conservation additionally confines the possible
operations and should give rise to a new resource. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,
087904 (2004), quant-ph/0310124] we showed that this resource can be quantified
by a single additional number, the superselection induced variance (SiV)
without changing the concept of entanglement. In this paper, we give the
results on pure states in greater detail; additionally, we provide a discussion
of mixed state nonlocality with superselection rules where we consider both
formation and distillation. Finally, we demonstrate that SiV is indeed a
resource, i.e., that it captures how well a state can be used to overcome the
restrictions imposed by the superselection rule.

asymmetric single quantum barrier are greatly enhanced by the transmission
resonance when the energy of incident particles is larger than the height of
the barrier. The resonant transmission group delay is of the order of the
quasibound state lifetime in the barrier region. The reflection group delay can
be either positive or negative, depending on the relative height of the
potential energies on the two sides of the barrier. Its magnitude is much
larger than the quasibound state lifetime. These predictions have been observed
in a microwave experiment by H. Spieker of Braunschweig University.

  computing without leakage","5 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a local optimal control strategy to produce desired unitary
transformations. Unitary transformations are central to all quantum
computational algorithms. Many realizations of quantum computation use a
submanifold of states, comprising the quantum register, coupled by an external
driving field to a collection of additional mediating excited states. Previous
attempts to apply control theory to induce unitary transformations on the
quantum register, while successful, produced pulses that drive the population
out of the computational register at intermediate times. Leakage of population
from the register is undesirable since often the states outside the register
are prone to decay and decoherence, and populating them causes a decrease in
the final fidelity. In this work we devise a local optimal control method for
achieving target unitary transformations on a quantum register, while avoiding
intermediate leakage out of the computational submanifold. The technique
exploits a phase locking of the field to the system such as to eliminate the
undesirable excitation. This method is then applied to produce an SU(6) Fourier
transform on the vibrational levels of the ground electronic state of the
Na$_2$ molecule. The emerging mechanism uses two photon resonances to create a
transformation on the quantum register while blocking one photon resonances to
excited states.
