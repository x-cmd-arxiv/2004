pairing (with maximum $T_{cp}^{max} \ga 5 \times 10^9$ K) and a moderate
neutron pairing ($T_{cn}^{max} \sim 6 \times 10^8$ K). When the internal
stellar temperature $T$ falls below $T_{cn}^{max}$, the neutrino luminosity
$L_{CP}$ due to Cooper pairing of neutrons behaves $\propto T^8$, just as that
produced by modified Urca process (in a non-superfluid star) but is higher by
about two orders of magnitude. In this case the Cooper-pairing neutrino
emission acts like an enhanced cooling agent. By tuning the density dependence
$T_{cn}(\rho)$ we can explain observations of cooling isolated neutron stars in
the scenario in which direct Urca process or similar process in kaon/pion

stability investigations of rotationally supported circumstellar flows using
the shearing box formalism. Asymptotic scaling arguments justifying the
shearing box approximation are systematically derived, showing that there exist
two limits which we call small shearing box (SSB) and large shearing box (LSB).
The physical meaning of these two limits and their relationship to model
equations implemented by previous investigators are discussed briefly. Two
dimensional (2D) dynamics of the SSB are explored and shown to contain
transiently growing (TG) linear modes, whose nature is first discussed within
the context of linear theory. The fully nonlinear regime in 2D is investigated
numerically for very high Reynolds (Re) numbers. Solutions exhibiting sustained
dynamics are found and manifest episodic but recurrent TG behavior and these
are associated with the formation and long-term survival of coherent vortices.
The life-time of this spatio-temporal complexity depends on the Re number and
the strength and nature of the initial disturbance. We show results for a case
in which the dynamical activity persists for the entire duration of the
simulation (hundreds of box orbits). Some combinations of the Re number and the
initial perturbation spectrum (and strength) show the transiently growing
phenomenon to ultimately fade away or, in some instances, to be absent
altogether. Because the SSB approximation used here is equivalent to a 2D
incompressible flow, the dynamics can not depend on the Coriolis force.
Therefore, three dimensional (3D) simulations are needed in order to decide if
this force indeed suppresses nonlinear hydrodynamical instability in
rotationally supported disks in the shearing box.

with masses of about 0.05-1.0 M_sun. After correcting for incompleteness and
contamination by foreground field dwarfs, we investigate the mass function of
the cluster, its binary content, and search for evidence of mass segregation
among lower mass stars. There is evidence for mass segregation between high (>3
M_sun) and lower mass stars, but over the range 0.1<M<0.7 M_sun, the data are
consistent with no further mass segregation. By fitting King profiles we
conclude that at least 60 percent of the low-mass stellar population are
contained in our survey. The cluster mass function is remarkably similar to the
Pleiades for 0.075<M<0.7 M_sun. Because of its age (~30 Myr), we demonstrate
that this mass function is robust to several systematic uncertainties likely to
affect older and younger clusters and is therefore one of the best available
estimates for the initial mass function in young disc populations. For
0.05<M<0.075 M_sun there is some evidence for a deficit of brown dwarfs in NGC
2547 compared with other clusters. This deficit may extend to lower masses or
may only be a dip, perhaps caused by an imperfect understanding of the
mass-magnitude relationship at temperatures of 2800K.Incompleteness in our
survey, and the luminosity functions from which we estimate contamination,
leave this question open. The binary fraction for systems with mass ratios
greater than about 0.5 is 20-35 per cent for M-dwarfs in NGC 2547, quite
consistent with that found in the field (abridged).

is characterized by strong absorption lines over the UV continuum from C, N, O,
Al, Si, and Fe in various ionization stages. While some of these lines are
interstellar, several among the strongest absorptions are identified with
stellar photospheric lines. Most of the photospheric and interstellar features
are stronger in the K-luminous composite spectrum than in LBGs at z~3. This
suggests higher metallicity and possibly also larger interstellar velocity
dispersion caused by macroscopic motions. The absorption lines and the slope of
the UV continuum is well matched by the spectrum of the nearby luminous
infrared galaxy NGC 6090, which is in the process of merging. A metallicity
higher than solar is suggested by comparing the pure photospheric lines (SiIII,
CIII, FeV) with starburst models. The evidence of high metallicity, together
with the high masses, high star-formation rates, and possibly strong
clustering, well qualify these galaxies as progenitors of local massive
ellipticals.

volume-limited surveys. We apply our adaptive selection criterion to the 2dFGRS

smooth, flat continuum and strong, broad hydrogen Balmer emission lines at
wavelengths consistent with the catalogued redshift of NGC 3432, strengthening
the association of the variable with the galaxy. Photometric monitoring reveals
a complex and erratic light curve over a time span of ~10 days. Subsequent
optical spectra over the next ~3 months continued to show strong Balmer
emission lines with a mean full-width at half-maximum intensity ~1550 km/s and
a distinct red asymmetry. A spectrum obtained 9 months after the outburst is
similar to the previous spectra, but the integrated flux in H-alpha is nearly
half that observed during the outburst. The object's photometric behavior,

variable star and might be related to some luminous blue variable stars such as
eta Carinae and SN 1997bs in NGC 3627. The brightest apparent magnitude implies
an absolute magnitude of approximately -12.7 at the distance of NGC 3432, a

lines from Brg, to Br24, and medium resolution (R~9000) spectra of the Brg,
Br12 and Br13 lines. The dereddened fluxes indicates that the lines remain
moderately thick up to high quantum numbers. Moreover, the profiles of the
three lines observed in medium resolution are all broad and nearly symmetric,
with a trend for the lines at high n-number to be narrower than the Brg, line.
With the assumption that the three lines have different optical depths and
consequently trace zones at different physical depths, we interprete the
observed profiles as evidence that the ionized gas velocity in the HI emitting
region is increasing as we move outwards, as expected in an accelerating wind
more than in an infalling gas. We have modelled the observed line ratios and
velocities with a simplified model for the HI excitation in an expanding
circumstellar gas. Such a comparison indicates that the observations are
consistent with the emission coming from a very compact region of 4-6 solar
radii, where the gas has been already accelerated to velocities of the order of
200 \kms, with an associated mass flow rate of the ionized component of the
order of 10^{-7} solar masses per year. This implies that the observed lines
should originate either from a stellar wind or from the inner part of a disk
wind, providing that the disk inner truncation radius is close to the stellar

significant at the 99.999% level. This result consolidates the findings
recently obtained by other authors. In the flux interval explored, the data are
consistent with an intrinsic distribution of the absorbing columns (flat per
decade above logNH>21) independent of luminosity and redshift, together with an
AGN luminosity function evolving purely in luminosity. It is shown that, on the
other hand, extrapolation to lower fluxes fails to reproduce the results
inferred from the Chandra Deep Field North survey. It is found that about 40%
of the high luminosity sources in our sample have best fit logNH>22, and the
surface density of these X-ray obscured QSOs can then be estimated at about 48

boson representation. The large N limit is taken maintaining the ratio k=K/N
fixed. This approach differs from previous approaches, in that we do not
explicitly enforce a constraint on the spin representation of the Schwinger

singlet. With this device, the large N limit can be taken, in such a way that a

acoustic emissions over four decades in time. We also discover correlations
between some characteristics of the primary creep (exponent of the power-law
and duration) and the time to failure of the samples. This result indicates
that the tertiary regime is dependent on the relaxation and damage processes
that occur in the primary regime and suggests a method of prediction of the
time to failure based on the early time recording of the strain rate or AE
rate. We consider a simple model of representative elements, interacting via
democratic load sharing, with a large heterogeneity of strengths. Each element
consists of a non-linear dashpot in parallel with a spring. This model recovers
the experimental observations of the strain rate as a function of time.

be a global one. A central element in the discussion is the rank of the Jacobi

Killing horizons exist only if it equals to 3. For certain self-interactions
asymptotically flat black holes with scalar hair do exist. An example relevant

four-gauge-boson interactions, some contribute to the diagonal and off-diagonal

This requires a renormalisation of the gauge-boson fields, which, in turn,
modifies the charged- and neutral-current interactions, although none of the
additional operators contain fermion fields. Bounds on the anomalous couplings
from electroweak precision measurements at LEP and SLD are correlated with the

up to 500 GeV. At a future linear collider the triple-gauge-boson couplings

approaches to anomalous gauge-boson couplings: the form-factor approach, the
addition of anomalous coupling terms to the SM Lagrangian after and, as
outlined above, before SSB. The translation of the bounds on the couplings from
one approach to another is not straightforward. We show that it can be done for

expectation values (VEVs) break both the GUT gauge symmetry and the horizontal
symmetry at the same time. Although the scale of the VEVs become too large to
suppress the flavor changing neutral current processes sufficiently, the
unification is possible. In addition, for the $SU(3)_H$ models, the $SU(3)_H$

complications arise when the Hamiltonian constraints are evaluated in the
presence of matter. Nevertheless, the constraint structure is the same as in
the bosonic theory. In the matterless case gauge independent nonlocal
correlators are calculated non-perturbatively. They respect local quantum
triviality and allow a topological interpretation. In the presence of matter
the ensuing nonlocal effective theory is expanded in matter loops. The lowest
order tree vertices are derived and discussed, entailing the phenomenon of
virtual black holes which essentially determine the corresponding S-matrix. Not
all vertices are conformally invariant, but the S-matrix is invariant, as
expected. Finally, the proper measure for the 1-loop corrections is addressed.

spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry. Corrections to the Newton potential
generated by a static source have been computed: they yield a limit M < 10 MeV

maximal at a distance L ~ 1000 km from the source. However, these corrections
propagate at a tiny velocity, v_s ~ 10^{-12} m/s, many orders of magnitude
smaller than the velocity of any plausible source. We compute the gravitational
potential taking the motion of the source into account: the standard Newton law
is recovered in this case, with negligible corrections for any distance from
the source up to astrophysical scales. Still, the vacuum of the theory is
unstable, and requiring stability over the lifetime of the Universe gives a
limit for M which is not too far from the one given above. In the absence of a
direct coupling of the ghost to matter, signatures of this model will have to
be searched in the form of exotic astrophysical events.

curvature corrections that induce interacting perturbations of the string
worldsheet Hamiltonian. We develop a systematic light-cone gauge quantization
of the interacting worldsheet string theory and use it to obtain the
interacting spectrum of the so-called `two-impurity' states of the string. The
quantization is technically rather intricate and we provide a detailed account
of the methods we use to extract explicit results. We give a systematic
treatment of the fermionic states and are able to show that the spectrum
possesses the proper extended supermultiplet structure (a non-trivial fact
since half the supersymmetry is nonlinearly realized). We test holography by
comparing the string energy spectrum with the scaling dimensions of
corresponding gauge theory operators. We confirm earlier results that agreement
obtains in low orders of perturbation theory, but breaks down at third order.

Say that $\Omega$ is 1--lacunary iff $\Omega$ is an ordinary lacunary set of

  Every $N+1$--lacunary set can be obtained from some $N$--lacunary $\Omega_N$
adding some points to $\Omega_N$. Between each two neighbor points

which respects the comultiplication and maps $K(G)$ into the center of $M(B)$.
These multiplier Hopf algebras are called {\it $G$-cograded multiplier Hopf

neutrino-nucleus cross sections, the nu-SNS (Spallation Neutron Source) and low
energy beta beams. The former produces neutrinos by pion decay at rest, while
the latter produces neutrinos from the beta decays of accelerated ions. One of
the uses of neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements is for supernova
studies, where typical neutrino energies are 10s of MeV. In this energy range
there are many different components to the nuclear response and this makes the
theoretical interpretation of the results of such an experiment complex.
Although even one measurement on a heavy nucleus such as lead is much
anticipated, more than one data set would be still better. We suggest that this
can be done by breaking the electron spectrum down into the parts produced in
coincidence with one or two neutrons, running a beta beam at more than one
energy, comparing the spectra produced with pions and a beta beam or any
combination of these.
