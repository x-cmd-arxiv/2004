dwarfs: $t_0 > 12$Gyr, together with recent new high redshift supernova
observations from the HST/GOODS program and previous supernova data, we give a
considerable estimation of the equation of state for dark energy, with uniform
priors as weak as $0.2<\Omega_m<0.4$ or $0.1<\Omega_m h^2<0.16$. We find cosmic
age limit plays a significant role in lowering the upper bound on the variation
amplitude of dark energy equation of state. We propose in this paper a new
scenario of dark energy dubbed Quintom, which gives rise to the equation of
state larger than -1 in the past and less than -1 today, satisfying current
observations. In addition we've also considered the implications of recent
X-ray gas mass fraction data on dark energy, which favors a negative running of
the equation of state.

both optical and near-infrared surface photometry. The analysis is based on a
sample of 36 nearby early-type galaxies, obtained from the Early Data Release
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Surface
brightness profiles were derived in each band, and used to study the color
gradients of the galaxies. Using simple stellar population models with both
optical and near infrared colors, we may interpret the color gradients in term
of age and metallicity gradients of galaxies. Using $g_Z \equiv d \log Z_{\rm
met} / d \log R $ and $g_A = d \log {\rm Age} / d \log R $ to represent the
metallicity and age gradients, we found a median value of $g_Z=-0.25\pm 0.03$

corresponding values for the age gradient were $g_A=0.02\pm 0.04$ and
$\sigma_{g_A}=0.25\pm0.03$. These results are in good agreement with recent
observational results, as well as with recent simulations that suggest both
monolithic collapse and major merger have played important roles in the

confirmed to be at $4.5<z<5.2$. The rest-frame UV spectra of seven LBGs
commonly show no or weak Lyalpha emission line (rest-frame equivalent width of
0-10\AA) and relatively strong low-ionization interstellar metal absorption
lines of SiII $\lambda$1260, OI+SiII $\lambda$1303, and CII $\lambda$1334 (mean
rest-frame equivalent widths of them are $-1.2 \sim -5.1 $\AA). These
properties are significantly different from those of the mean rest-frame UV

LBGs at $z\sim3$ with no or weak Lyalpha emission. The weakness of Lyalpha
emission and strong low-ionization interstellar metal absorption lines may
indicate that these LBGs at $z\sim5$ are chemically evolved to some degree and
have a dusty environment. Since the fraction of such LBGs at $z\sim5$ in our

of LBGs from $z\sim5$ to $z\sim3$, though the present sample size is very
small. It is also possible, however, that the brighter LBGs tend to show no or
weak Lyalpha emission, because our spectroscopic sample is bright (brighter
than $L^{\ast}$) among LBGs at $z\sim5$. More observations are required to
establish spectroscopic nature of LBGs at $z\sim5$.

to ~2000 K at B0 Ia. In general, H$\alpha$ derived mass-loss rates are
consistent with UV and far-UV spectroscopy, although from consideration of the
SIV $\lambda\lambda$1063-1073 doublet, clumped winds are preferred over
homogenous models. AV 235 (B0 Iaw) is a notable exception, which has an
unusually strong H$\alpha$ profile that is inconsistent with the other Balmer
lines and UV wind diagnostics. We also derive CNO abundances for our sample,
revealing substantial nitrogen enrichment, with carbon and oxygen depletion.
Our results are supported by comparison with the Galactic supergiant HD 2905

previous suggestions that ``normal'' OB-type supergiants exhibit atmospheric

(ii) the areal {\em density} of the random resonators decays sharply with the
quality factor of the mode that they trap. We find analytically the shape of

parameter increases as a power law with $\ln S$, where $S$ is the sample area

viewpoint of optical conductivity measurements. Coherent quasiparticle
conductivity, in the form of a Drude peak centred at zero frequency, is found
to disappear as the mean free path (at $\omega$ = 0) becomes comparable to the
interatomic spacing. This basic loss of coherence at the so-called
Mott-Ioffe-Regel (MIR) limit suggests that the universality of the MIR
criterion is preserved even in the presence of strong electron correlations. We
argue that the shedding of spectral weight at low frequencies, induced by
strong correlation effects, is the primary origin of the extended positive
slope of the resistivity to high temperatures observed in all so-called ""bad
metals"". Moreover, in common with those metals which exhibit resistivity
saturation at high temperatures, the scattering rate itself, as extracted from
optical spectra, saturates at a value consistent with the MIR limit. We
consider possible implications that this ceiling in the scattering rate may
have for our understanding of transport within a wide variety of bad metals and
suggest a better method for analysing their optical response.

active vibration isolation, implemented at the suspension points of the mirrors
of an interferometric gravitational wave detector. We constructed a prototype
Fabry-Perot interferometer equipped with an SPI and observed vibration
isolation in both the spectrum and transfer function. The noise spectrum of the
main interferometer was reduced by 40 dB below 1 Hz. Transfer function
measurements showed that the SPI also produced good vibration suppression above
1 Hz. These results indicate that SPI can improve both the sensitivity and the
stability of the interferometer.

Markov chains on finite state space which formally includes some stochastic
optimization algorithms. Specifically, let {P_n} be a sequence of transition
matrices on a finite state space which converge to a limit transition matrix P.
Let {X_n} be the associated nonhomogeneous Markov chain where P_n controls
movement from time n-1 to n. The main statements are a large deviation
principle and bounds for additive functionals of the nonhomogeneous process
under some regularity conditions. In particular, when P is reducible, three
regimes that depend on the decay of certain ``connection'' P_n probabilities
are identified. Roughly, if the decay is too slow, too fast or in an
intermediate range, the large deviation behavior is trivial, the same as the
time-homogeneous chain run with P or nontrivial and involving the decay rates.
Examples of anomalous behaviors are also given when the approach P_n\to P is
irregular. Results in the intermediate regime apply to geometrically fast
running optimizations, and to some issues in glassy physics.

certain noble gases in gasses vented from volcanoes and the possibility of a
nuclear georeactor at the centre of the Earth. This paper focuses on a proposal
for an underground laboratory to further develop antineutrinos as a tool to map
the distribution of radiogenic heat sources, such as the natural radionuclides
and the hypothetical nuclear georeactor.

electron generated by detachment from photoexcited anions (such as I-, OH-,
ClO^4-, and [SO3]^2-) linearly decreases by 6-12% per 1 M ionic strength. In 9
M sodium perchlorate solution, this quantum yield decreases by roughly an order
of magnitude. Ultrafast kinetic studies of 200 nm photon induced electron
detachment from Br-, HO- and [SO3]^2- suggest that the prompt yield of
thermalized electron does not change in these solutions; rather, the ionic
strength effect originates in more efficient recombination of geminate pairs.
Within the framework of the recently proposed mean force potential (MFP) model
of charge separation dynamics in such photosystems, the observed changes are
interpreted as an increase in the short-range attractive potential between the
geminate partners. Association of sodium cation(s) with the electron and the
parent anion is suggested as the most likely cause for the observed
modification of the MFP. Electron thermalization kinetics suggest that the
cation associated with the parent anion (by ion pairing and/or ionic atmosphere
interaction) is passed to the detached electron in the course of the
photoreaction. The precise atomic-level mechanism for the ionic strength effect
is presently unclear; any further advance is likely to require the development
of an adequate quantum molecular dynamics model.

framework of the GMPC we show that correctly introduced nearest-neighbor
stacking interactions against the background of hydrogen bonding lead to
increased stability (melting temperature) and, unexpectedly, to decreased
cooperativity (maximal correlation length). The increase in stability is
explained as due to an additional stabilizing interaction (stacking) and the
surprising decrease in cooperativity is seen as a result of mixing of
contributions of hydrogen bonding and stacking.

spaces correspond precisely to state property systems for which the elements 0

to split a state property system into a number of 'pure nonclassical state

decomposition theorem for a state property system is the translation of a
