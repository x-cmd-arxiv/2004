energy neutrinos. Some of them are based on a simple rescaling of the TeV
$\gamma$-ray fluxes from recently detected galactic sources, such as,
shell-type supernova remnants or pulsar wind nebulae. Others present detailed
and originally performed modeling of processes occurring close to compact
objects, i.e. neutron stars and low mass black holes, which are supposed to
accelerate hadrons close to dense matter and radiation fields. Most of the
models considered in this review optimistically assume that the energy content
in relativistic hadrons is equal to a significant part of the maximum
observable power output in specific sources, i.e. typically $\sim 10%$. This
may give a large overestimation of the neutrino fluxes. This is the case of
models which postulate neutrino production in hadron-photon collisions already
at the acceleration place, due to the likely $e^\pm$ pair plasma domination.
Models postulating neutrino production in hadron-hadron collisions avoid such
problems and therefore seem to be more promising. The neutrino telescopes
currently taking data have not detected any excess from discrete sources yet,
although some models could already be constrained by the limits they are
providing.

circular, as detected by a local observer with arbitrary peculiar velocity.
Explicit expressions for the radius and center position of such an observed
circle-in-the-sky, as well as for the angular displacement of points on the
circle, are derived. In general, a circle is detected as a circle of different
radius, displaced relative to its original position, and centered at a point
which does not correspond to its detected center in the comoving frame.
Further, there is an angular displacement of points on the circles. These
effects all arise from aberration of cosmic microwave background radiation,
exhausting the purely geometric effects due to the peculiar motion of our
galaxy, and are independent of both the large scale curvature of space and the
expansion of the universe, since aberration is a purely local phenomenon. For a
Lorentz-boosted observer with the speed of our entire galaxy, the maximum
(detectable) changes in the angular radius of a circle, its maximum center
displacement, as well as the maximum angular distortion are shown all to be of
order $\beta=(v/c)$ radians. In particular, two back-to-back matching circles
in a finite universe will have an upper bound of $2|\beta|$ in the variation of
either their radii, the angular position of their centers, or the angular
distribution of points.

how this dark energy model can be described in terms of scalar fields,
corresponding to a minimally coupled scalar field, a Born-Infeld scalar field

phenomenologically viable model where dark energy is described by a phantom

consistent with formation in a dense, collision-dominated plasma. Both the RGS

plasma (model cevmkl in XSPEC). Helium, nitrogen, oxygen and neon are required
to adequately model the spectrum, however, the inclusion of sulphur and iron
further improves the fit, suggesting these elements may also be present at low
abundance. We confirm in the X-rays the underabundance of both carbon and
oxygen relative to nitrogen, first deduced from optical spectroscopy by Marsh

rate of ~9e-13 solar masses per year. The implied temperature and density of
the emitting plasma, combined with the presence of narrow emission lines are
consistent with production of the X-ray emission in an optically thin boundary

that an off-center hydrodynamical collision occurred some 10 Gyr ago between
the primordial gas-rich Andromeda galaxy and the similar Galaxy, and compressed
the halo gas to form the LGG dwarf galaxies including the Magellanic Clouds. In
this model, new-born dwarf galaxies can be expected to locate near the orbital
plane of these two massive galaxies. In order to see the reality of this model,
we reexamine the two-dimensional sky distribution of the LGG members and the
Magellanic Stream, we confirm an earlier and widely-discussed idea that they
align along two similar great circles, each with an angular width of $\sim
30^{\circ}$, and the planes of these circles are approximately normal to the
line joining the present position of the sun and the Galactic center. Further
we make a three-dimensional distribution map of these objects, and observe it
from various directions. A well-defined plane of finite thickness is found,
within which most of the member galaxies are confined, supporting the existence
of the above circles on the sky. Thus we could determine the orbital elements
of M31 relative to the Galaxy through reproducing the well-studied dynamics of
the LMC and the SMC around the Galaxy. The expected proper motion of M31 is
$(\mu_l, \mu_b)=(38 \mu as/yr, -49 \mu as/yr)$. Probable orbital motions of the

emission is featureless and contributes ~ 80% to the total X-ray emission in
the 0.3 - 10 keV band. The most remarkable feature of the present observation
is the detection of X-ray variability at very short time scale: the X-ray
emission varied by 35% in about 5000 s. We find that this variability can be
explained by assuming that only the overall normalization varied during the
observation. There was no evidence for any short term spectral variability and
the spectral shape was similar even during the ASCA observation carried out in
1997. Considering the high intrinsic luminosity (~ 2x10^45 erg/s) and the large
inferred mass of the putative black hole (~ 1.6x10^8 M_sun), the observed time
scale of variability indicates emission at close to Eddington luminosity
arising from very close to the black hole. We suggest that PHL 1092 in

have, on average, larger grains than their flared counterparts. These data
suggest that the geometry of a young stellar disk evolves from flared to

seventeen nearby spiral galaxies of intermediate to late morphological type. We
discuss the properties of each sample galaxy distinguishing between those
characterized by regular or peculiar kinematics. In most of the observed
galaxies ionized gas rotates more rapidly than stars and have a lower velocity
dispersion, as is to be expected if the gas is confined in the disc and
supported by rotation while the stars are mostly supported by dynamical
pressure. In a few objects, gas and stars show almost the same rotational
velocity and low velocity dispersion, suggesting that their motion is dominated
by rotation.
  Incorporating the spiral galaxies studied by Bertola et al. (1996), Corsini
et al. (1999, 2003) and Vega Beltran et al. (2001) we have compiled a sample of
50 S0/a-Scd galaxies, for which the major-axis kinematics of the ionized gas
and stars have been obtained with the same spatial (~1'') and spectral
(~50km/s) resolution, and measured with the same analysis techniques. This
allowed us to address the frequency of counterrotation in spiral galaxies. It
turns out that less than 12% and less than 8% (at the 95% confidence level) of
the sample galaxies host a counterrotating gaseous and stellar disc,
respectively. The comparison with S0 galaxies suggests that the retrograde
acquisition of small amounts of external gas gives rise to counterrotating
gaseous discs only in gas-poor S0s, while in gas-rich spirals the newly
acquired gas is swept away by the pre-existing gas. Counterrotating gaseous and
stellar discs in spirals are formed only from the retrograde acquisition of
large amounts of gas exceeding that of pre-existing gas, and subsequent star
formation, respectively.

dust structures around C-rich AGB stars. This spatio-temporal structure
formation process is caused by a radiative/thermal instability of dust forming
gases as identified by Woitke et al.(2000). Our 2D (axisymmetric) models
combine a time-dependent description of the dust formation process according to
Gail & Sedlmayr (1988) with detailed, frequency-dependent continuum radiative
transfer by means of a Monte Carlo method (Niccolini et al.2003) in an
otherwise static medium (v=0). These models show that the formation of dust
behind already condensed regions, which shield the stellar radiation field, is
strongly favoured. In the shadow of these clouds, the temperature decreases by
several hundred Kelvin which triggers the subsequent formation of dust and
ensures its thermal stability. Considering an initially dust-free gas with
small density inhomogeneities, we find that finger-like dust structures develop
which are cooler than the surroundings and point towards the centre of the
radiant emission, similar to the cometary knots observed in planetary nebulae
and star formation regions. Compared to a spherical symmetric reference model,
the clumpy dust distribution has little effect on the spectral energy
distribution, but dominates the optical appearance in near IR monochromatic

an effect of turbulence on the microscopic particle dynamics. Our main goal is
to analyze the dispersion of ideal test particles faced to diverse conditions
in the turbulent domain. Depending on the amplitude of the background field and
the input test particle velocity, we observe distinct transport regimes ranging
from subdiffusion of guiding centers in the limit of Hamiltonian dynamics to
random walks on a percolating fractal array and further to nearly diffusive
behavior of the mean-square particle displacement versus time. In all cases, we
find complex microscopic structure of the particle motion revealing long-time
rests and trapping phenomena, sporadically interrupted by the phases of active
cross-field propagation reminiscent of Levy-walk statistics. These complex
features persist even when the particle dispersion is diffusive. An
interpretation of the results obtained is proposed in connection with the
fractional kinetics paradigm extending the microscopic properties of transport
far beyond the conventional picture of a Brownian random motion. A calculation
of the transport exponent for random walks on a fractal lattice is advocated
from topological arguments. An intriguing indication of the topological
approach is a gap in the transport exponent separating Hamiltonian-like and
fractal random walk-like dynamics, supported through the simulation.

discussed based on a mean field theory for an effective Kugel-Khomskii model of
localized orbital and spin degrees of freedom. This model results from an
orbital selective Mott transition which in the three-band system localized two
orbitals while leaving the third one itinerant. Special attention is given to
the region around a structure quantum phase transition at $ x \approx 0.5 $
where the crystal lattice changes from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry
while leaving the system metallic. This transition yields, a change from
ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic spin correlations. The complete mean field
phase diagram for this transition is given including orbital and spin order.
The anisotropy of spin susceptibility, a consequence of spin-orbit coupling and
orbital correlation, is a tell-tale sign of one of these phases. In the
predominantly antiferromagnetic phase we describe a metamagnetic transition in
a magnetic field and show that coupling of the itinerant band to the localized
degrees of freedom yields an anomalous longitudinal magnetoresistance
transition. Both phenomena are connected with the evolution of the
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains in the external magnetic field and
agree qualitatively with the experimental findings.

assumption that the fermionic interactions are dependent only on the value of a

applicable to describe a system with an energetically broad Feshbach resonance.

phase shift affects the physical properties of the system. We develop a
theoretical framework which allows for a tuning of the scattering phase shift

the wetting in the growth and self-assembly of three-dimensional (3D) coherent
islands are studied using an energy minimization scheme in a 1+1-dimensional
atomic model with anharmonic interactions. The conditions for equilibrium
between the different phases are discussed. It is found that the thermodynamic
driving force for 3D-cluster formation is the reduced adhesion of the islands
to the wetting layer at their edges. In agreement with experimental
observations, for values of the lattice mismatch larger than a critical misfit,
a critical island size for the 2D-3D transition is found. Beyond it, monolayer
islands become unstable against bilayer ones. Compressed coherent overlayers
show a greater tendency to clustering than expanded ones. The transition to 3D
islands takes place through a series of intermediate stable states with
thicknesses discretely increasing in monolayer steps. Special emphasis is made
on the analysis of the critical misfit. Additionally, the effect of
neighbouring islands mediated through a deformable wetting layer is considered.
The degree of wetting of the substrate by a given island depends on the size
and shape distributions of the neighbouring islands. Implications for the
self-assembled growth of quantum dots are discussed.

microwave permittivity of which may depend on an external dc magnetic field or
tensile stress. The composites consist of short pieces of conductive
ferromagnetic microwires embedded into a dielectric matrix. The short wire
inclusions play a role of the elementary scatterers, when the electromagnetic
wave irradiates the composite and induces a longitudinal current distribution
and electrical dipole moment in each inclusion. These induced dipole moments
form the dipole response, which can be characterized by some complex effective
permittivity. The later may have a resonance or relaxation dispersion caused by
the strong current distribution along a wire, which depends on the wire high
frequency surface impedance. In the vicinity of the resonance frequency any
variations in the wire surface impedance result in a large change of the
current distribution, and hence in the dipole moment of each inclusion and the
effective permittivity on the whole. For a ferromagnetic conductive microwire,
the surface impedance may depend not only on its conductivity but also on the
dc external magnetic field and tension through the so-called magneto-impedance
effect (MI). Therefore, the dispersion of the effective permittivity can be
tuned from a resonance type to a relaxation type, when a sufficient magnetic
field or tensile stress is applied to the composite sample. A number of
applications can be proposed, including the stress-sensitive media for remote

enumerable semimeasures, hence the resulting models are stochastic). We prove
convergence theorems similar to Solomonoff's theorem of universal induction,
which also holds for general Bayes mixtures. The bound characterizing the
convergence speed for MDL predictions is exponentially larger as compared to
Bayes mixtures. We observe that there are at least three different ways of
using MDL for prediction. One of these has worse prediction properties, for
which predictions only converge if the MDL estimator stabilizes. We establish
sufficient conditions for this to occur. Finally, some immediate consequences
for complexity relations and randomness criteria are proven.

neglected previously, but we find that they provide the most stringent

(DAMA) is proposed. The modified DAMA (M-DAMA) preserves all the attractive
properties of DAMA, such as its pole structure and Regge asymptotics, and leads
to a generalized dual amplitude $A(s,t,Q^2)$. This generalized amplitude can be
checked in the known kinematical limits, i.e. it should reduce to the ordinary
dual amplitude on mass shell, and to the nuclear structure function when $t=0$.
In such a way we complete a unified ""two-dimensionally dual"" picture of strong
interaction. By comparing the structure function $F_2$, resulting from M-DAMA,
with phenomenological parameterizations, we fix the $Q^2$-dependence in M-DAMA.
In all studied regions, i.e. in the large and low $x$ limits as well as in the
resonance region, the results of M-DAMA are in qualitative agreement with the
experiment.

determine the coefficients of spin-spin interaction terms in D^(1) by imposing
the condition of regularity of a BMN-type scaling limit. For long spin chains,
these coefficients turn out to be expressible in terms of hypergeometric
functions of \lambda, which have regular expansions at both small and large

in the two-scalar sector should generically scale as square root of \lambda at

by considering algebraic endomorphisms of the variety as `similarity' maps.
Self-similar fractals are subsets of algebraic varieties which can be written
as a finite and disjoint union of `similar' copies. Fractals provide a
framework in which, one can unite some results and conjectures in Diophantine
geometry. We define a well-behaved notion of dimension for self-similar
fractals. We also prove a fractal version of Roth's theorem for algebraic
points on a variety approximated by elements of a fractal subset. As a
consequence, we get a fractal version of Siegel's theorem on finiteness of
integral points on hyperbolic curves and a fractal version of Falting's theorem
on Diophantine approximation on abelian varieties.

photon asymmetry in np radiative capture, and the asymmetries in deuteron
photo-disintegration d(gamma,n)p in the threshold region and
electro-disintegration d(e,e`)np in quasi-elastic kinematics. To have an
estimate of the model dependence for the various predictions, a number of
different, latest-generation strong-interaction potentials--Argonne v18, Bonn
2000, and Nijmegen I--are used in combination with a weak-interaction potential
consisting of pi-, rho-, and omega-meson exchanges--the model known as DDH. The
complete bound and scattering problems in the presence of parity-conserving,
including electromagnetic, and parity-violating potentials is solved in both
configuration and momentum space. The issue of electromagnetic current
conservation is examined carefully. We find large cancellations between the
asymmetries induced by the parity-violating interactions and those arising from
the associated pion-exchange currents. In the np capture, the model dependence
is nevertheless quite small, because of constraints arising through the Siegert
evaluation of the relevant E1 matrix elements. In quasi-elastic electron
scattering these processes are found to be insignificant compared to the
asymmetry produced by gamma-Z interference on individual nucleons.

predictions. A phase diagram method is used to illustrate this distinct phase
