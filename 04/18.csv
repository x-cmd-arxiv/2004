black hole binary XTE J1650-500 obtained between 2003 May and August with the
6.5m Clay Telescope. A timing analysis of these data reveals a photometric
period of 0.3205 +/- 0.0007 days (i.e. 7.63 hr) with a possible alias at 0.3785
days (9.12 hr). Our photometry completely rules out the previously published
spectroscopic period of 0.212 days (5.09 hr). Consequently, we reanalyzed the
15 archival ESO/VLT spectra (obtained 2002 June by Sanchez-Fernandez et al.)
that were the basis of the previously published spectroscopic period. We used a
``restframe search'' technique that is well suited for cases when the
signal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra is low. The results confirmed the
photometric period of 0.3205 days, and rule out the alias period near 0.38
days. The best value for the velocity semiamplitude of the companion star is
K_2 = 435 +/- 30 km/sec, and the corresponding optical mass function is f(M) =
2.73 +/- 0.56 solar masses. The amplitude of the phased R-band light curve is
0.2 magnitudes, which gives a lower limit to the inclination of 50 +/- 3
degrees in the limiting case of no contribution to the R-band light curve from
the accretion disk. If the mass ratio of XTE J1650-500 is similar to the mass
ratios of other black hole binaries like A0620-00 or GRS 1124-683 (e.g. Q >~
10), then our lower limit to the inclination gives an upper limit to the mass
of the black hole in XTE J1650-500 of M_1 <~ 7.3 solar masses. However, the
mass can be considerably lower if the R-band flux is dominated by the accretion
disk. For example, if the accretion disk does contribute 80% of the flux, as
our preliminary results suggest, then the black hole mass would be only about 4
solar masses.

limited to eigenmodes which correspond to eigenvalues outside the Wishart

eigenmodes and find slight negative serial correlation for eigenmodes within

suggest that interpolating missing data or illiquid trading days with
zero-order hold introduces high frequency noise and spurious serial
correlation.

transverse and longitudinal gravitational radiation on and near a black hole.
Corresponding energy-tensor forms of the first law involve a preferred time
vector which plays the role for dynamical black holes which the stationary
Killing vector plays for stationary black holes. Identifying an energy flux,
vanishing if and only if the horizon is null, allows a division into
energy-supply and work terms, as in the first law of thermodynamics. The energy
supply can be expressed in terms of area increase and a newly defined surface
gravity, yielding a Gibbs-like equation, with a similar form to the so-called

of Hardy algebras associated with $W^*$-correspondences. It generalizes the
model theory of Sz.-Nagy and Foias and the work of Popescu on models of row
contractions. We also emphasize the concept of duality for
$W^*$-correspondences and its relation to Morita equivalence of
correspondenses.

group, is in excellent agreement with the astrophysical cross section factor
(S17) measured by the Weizmann group with a 7Be target. The GSI and Weizmann
data are in good agreement with the Seattle data at high energies, but at low
energies we observe a slight systematic (up to 2sigma) deviation, yet the
Seattle group repeatedly rejects the CD method. We show that when plotting the
slopes, they mis plotted one CD data point and exclude measured slopes that
contradict their claim. Indeed the measured slope is essential to elucidate the
d-wave correction to S17(0) that could be as large as 15%, and is the last open
question that needs to be resolved before S17(0) can be quoted with an accuracy
of 5% or better. We show that this goal has not been achieved (in spite of the
strong claim of the Seattle group), since currently there is no agreement among
experiments as well as among theoretical models on the value of the slope. In
addition, currently there is no theoretical framework within which (for example
the Seattle) data can be analyzed and S17(0) extrapolated with the claimed high
precision of 2.5%. This (last) issue of the slope and the d-wave correction
must be resolved (by future measurements) so as to allow quoting S17(0) with an
accuracy of 5% or better.

  Zooplankton: Application to Experiments with Swarms of Daphnia","38 pages, 21 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph",,"  Active Brownian Particles are self-propelled particles that move in a
dissipative medium subject to random forces, or noise . Additionally, they can
be confined by an external field and/or they can interact with one another. The
external field may actually be an attractive marker, for example a light field
(as in the experiment) or an energy potential or a chemical gradient (as in the
theory). The potential energy can also be the result of interparticle
attractive and/or repulsive forces summed over all particles (a mean field
potential). Four, qualitatively different motions of the particles are
possible: at small particle density their motions are approximately independent
of one another subject only to the external field and the noise, which results
in moving randomly through or performing rotational motions about a central
point in space. At increasing densities interactions play an important role and
individuals form a swarm performing several types of self-organized collective
motion. We apply this model for the description of zooplankton Daphnia swarms.
In the case of the zooplankton Daphnia (and probably many other aquatic animals
that form similar motions as well) this vortex is hydrodynamical but motivated
by the self-propelled motion of the individuals. Similar vortex-type motions
have been observed for other creatures ranging in size from bacteria to flocks
of birds and schools of fish. However, our experiment with Daphnia is unique in
that all four motions can be observed in controlled laboratory conditions with
the same animal. Moreover, the theory, presented in both continuous
differential equation and random walk forms, offers a quantitative, physically
based explanation of the four motions.
