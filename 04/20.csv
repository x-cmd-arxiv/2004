our results to the high redshift universe. We find that a range of physical
parameters, in particular dust temperature and gas temperature, but not so much
dust surface composition, influence the formation rate of H$_2$. The H$_2$
formation rate is found to be suppressed above gas kinetic temperatures of a
few hundred K and for dust temperatures above 200-300 K and below 10 K. We
highlight the differences between our treatment of the H$_2$ formation process
and other descriptions in the literature. We also study the relative importance
of H$_2$ formation on dust grains with respect to molecular hydrogen formation
in the gas phase, through the H$^-$ route. The ratio of formation rates of
these two routes depends to a large part on the dust abundance, on the electron
abundance, and also on the relative strength of the FUV (extra-)galactic
radiation field. We find that for a cosmological evolution of the star
formation rate and dust density consistent with the Madau plot, a positive
feedback effect on the abundance of H$_2$ due to the presence of dust grains
can occur at redshifts $z\ge 3$. This effect occurs for a dust-to-gas mass
ratio as small as 10$^{-3}$ of the galactic value.

matter profile. The cooling gas is replaced by the higher-entropy gas from the
outer regions, which raises the entropy and temperature of gas in the cluster
core. The magnitude of these effects is likely overestimated in the current
simulations because they suffer from the overcooling problem: a much larger
fraction of baryons is in the form of cold gas and stars than is observed. We
find that the thermal stellar feedback alone does not remedy this problem.
Additional ad-hoc preheating can lower the amount of cold gas but a simple
uniform preheating results in incorrect star formation history, as it delays
the bulk of star formation until z<1. Our analysis shows that the overcooling
in a cluster as a whole is really the overcooling in the central galaxy and its
progenitors at high redshifts. This indicates that an additional heating
mechanism that can continuously heat the gas in the cluster core is required to
reproduce the observed cluster properties. Energy injection by the Active
Galactic Nuclei, which may provide such heating, may thus be an important
missing ingredient in the current theoretical models of cluster formation.

magnetization, likely responsible for the jet collimation by hoop stresses
downstream of the shock. This scenario is investigated here by following the

the free expansion to the beginning of the reverberation phase. Our results

implicit way. Now we included the main standard physical ingredients together
with diffusion processes and a proper outer boundary condition. We have assumed
fully non - conservative mass transfer episodes.
  In order to study the interplay of mass loss episodes and diffusion we
considered evolutionary sequences with and without diffusion in which all Roche
lobe overflows (RLOFs) produce mass transfer. Another two sequences in which
thermonuclearly-driven RLOFs are not allowed to drive mass transfer have been
computed with and without diffusion. To our notice, this study represents the
first binary evolution calculations in which diffusion is considered.
  The system produces a helium white dwarf of \sim 0.21 \msun in an orbit with
a period of \sim 4.3 days for the four cases. We find that mass transfer
episodes induced by hydrogen thermonuclear flashes drive a tiny amount of mass
transfer. As diffusion produces stronger flashes, the amount of hydrogen - rich
matter transferred is slightly higher than in models without diffusion.
  We find that diffusion is the main agent in determining the evolutionary
timescale of low mass white dwarfs even in presence of mass transfer episodes.

Our goals are twofold. First, to provide an empirical calibration of near--IR
SBFs, given that existing stellar population synthesis models are particularly
discrepant in the near--IR. Second, whereas most previous SBF studies have
focused on old, metal rich populations, this is the first application to a
system with such a wide range of ages (~ 10^6 to more than 10^10 yr, i.e., 4
orders of magnitude), at the same time that the clusters have a very narrow
range of metallicities (Z ~ 0.0006 -- 0.01, ie., 1 order of magnitude only).
Since stellar population synthesis models predict a more complex sensitivity of
SBFs to metallicity and age in the near--IR than in the optical, this analysis
offers a unique way of disentangling the effects of age and metallicity. We
find a satisfactory agreement between models and data. We also confirm that
near--IR fluctuations and fluctuation colors are mostly driven by age in the
Magellanic cluster populations, and that in this respect they constitute a
sequence in which the Fornax Cluster galaxies fit adequately. Moreover,
fluctuation colors display a tendency to redden with age that can be fit by a
straight line. Finally, we use for the first time a Poissonian approach to
establish the error bars of the fluctuation measurements, instead of the
customary Monte Carlo simulations.

assume a binary system to explain the strong X-ray emission, but we also take
into account that, near periastron and because of the highly eccentric orbit,
the wind emerging from eta Carinae accumulates behind the shock and can mimic a
shell-like ejection event. For this process to be effective, at periastron the
secondary star should be located between eta Carinae and the observer, solving
also the discrepancy between the orbital parameters derived from ground and
space based observations. We show that, as the secondary moves in its orbit,
the shell cools down and the number of available stellar ionizing photons is
not enough to maintain the shell temperature at its equilibrium value of about
7500 K. The central part of the shell remains cold and under these conditions
grain formation and growth can take place in timescales of hours. Using
recently published HST data for the optical and UV continuum during the 2003
shell event, we estimated that a fraction of 0.01 of the interstellar dust to H
ratio is enough to explain the observations. We also calculated the neutral gas
column density intercepting the line of sight at each point of the orbit near
periastron, and were able to reproduce the form and duration of the X-ray light
curve without any change in the eta Carinae mass loss rate. This same column
density can explain the observed H$\alpha$ light curve observed during the 2003
event.

(``fireball'') that expands and emits to infinity the observed burst of
gamma-rays. This accretion-jet picture is similar to quasars and X-ray
binaries, however, there are important differences: the physical conditions and
the cooling mechanism in the disk are very different. The observed radiation is
emitted when the expanding fireball becomes transparent, at distances much
larger than the Schwarzschild radius. The burst is then observed as a powerful
relativistic explosion and the transient accretion disk in its center serves as
a brief source of energy that drives the explosion. The explosion picture
depends on the fireball nuclear composition which is shaped close to the black
hole. A large amount of free neutrons survive till the emission phase and link
the physics of the central engine to observed radiation.

in a layer of compressed gas within a few tenths of a parsec of the ionization
front. (2) Significantly fewer masers are seen in the observed fields than

the maser-exciting lifetime of protostars is much shorter in HII regions than

  output. Have a look!",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  Some observational constraints on the brane-world based on predictions from
specific models in five dimensions, have been recently reported, both on local
and cosmological scales. In order to identify the origins of these constraints,
the equations of motion of the brane-world are translated to the most general,
model-independent (or ""covariant""), formulation of the theory, based only on
the Einstein-Hilbert action for the bulk geometry, the confinement of the
standard gauge interactions and the exclusive probing of the extra dimensions
by the gravitational field. In the case of the binary pulsar PSR1913+16, it is
found that gravi-vectors and gravi-scalars do not appear in the covariant
equations, but they are replaced by vector and scalar fields related to the
extrinsic curvature of the brane-world. Only the latter one impose a condition
on the binary pulsar orbits. A general solution for this problem is proposed,
based on results from differential geometry, suggesting a stable bulk geometry,
whose existence requires higher dimensions. On the cosmological scale, it is
shown that the high energy inflation constraint originating from the square of
the energy density term in the modified Friedman's equation is mainly due to
the assumption of the reflection symmetry across the brane-world. It is shown
that this symmetry is not consistent with the regularity of the brane-world.
These results suggest that the two constraints can be lifted by increasing the
number of extra dimensions.

as the theory of gravity, there are yet many that suggest the presence of new
physics. In order to explain the high-redshift supernovae Ia observations
together with the recently made precise observations of the CMB anisotropy by
WMAP, the standard cosmology has to invoke some hypothetical matter with
unnatural properties which is very speculative. This casts doubts upon the
foundations of the standard cosmology and suggests that some theoretical
concept may still be missing from the theory.
  Such a concept might be the rotation of the astronomical objects, which has
not been properly taken care of when we claim that a perfect fluid is a good
approximation to the real contents of the universe. A crude estimation of the
angular kinetic energy of massive galaxies indicates to a possibility to have
$\Omega_{\rm total}\approx 1$ without invoking the hypothetical dark matter or
dark energy. This picture also appears consistent with the recent observations
of a great abundance of old massive galaxies made by Gemini Deep Deep Survey.
However, a proper relativistic theory of the rotating objects is still to be
investigated. It is expected that the consequences of incorporating rotation in
general relativity, and hence in special relativity, would be profound.

corresponds to a break in total radio power. The radio cores in FR Is are also
weaker than in FR IIs, although there is not a well defined break power. We
find that asymmetry in the structure of the sample members must be the
consequence of anisotropies in the medium where the lobes expand, with
orientation playing a minor role. Moreover, literature data and our
observations at kiloparsec scales suggest that the large differences between
the structures of FR I and FR II radio galaxies must arise from the poorly
known central kiloparsec region of their host galaxies. We analyze the
sub-sample of giant radio galaxies, and do not find evidence that these large
objects require higher core powers. Our results are consistent with giant radio
galaxies being the older population of normal FR I and FR II objects evolving
in low density environments. Comparing results from our sample with predictions
from the radio luminosity function we find no evidence of a possible FR II to
FR I evolution. Moreover, we conclude that at z~0.1, one out of four FR II
radio sources has a linear size above 500 kpc, thus being in an advanced stage
of evolution (for example, older than ~10 Myr assuming a jet-head velocity of
0.1c). Radio activity seems to be a short-lived process in active galaxies,

simulations of populations of PNe, whose individual properties are described
with the aid of recent PN synthetic models (Marigo et al. 2001), coupled to a
detailed photoionisation code (CLOUDY). The basic dependences of the cut-off
magnitude M* are then discussed. We find that: (i) In galaxies with recent or
ongoing star formation, the modelled PNLF present M* values between -4 and -5,
very close to the observationally-calibrated value for the LMC. (ii) In these
galaxies, the PNLF cut-off is produced by PNe with progenitor masses of about
2.5 Msun, while less massive stars give origin to fainter PNe. As a consequence
M* is expected to depend strongly on the age of the last burst of star
formation, dimming by as much as 5 mag as we go from young to 10-Gyr old
populations. (iii) Rather than on the initial metallicity of a stellar
population, M* depends on the actual [O/H] of the observed PNe, a quantity that
may differ significantly from the initial value (due to dredge-up episodes),
especially in young and intermediate-age PN populations. (iv) Also the
transition time from the end of AGB to the PN phase, and the nuclear-burning
properties (i.e. H- or He-burning) of the central stars introduce
non-negligible effects on M*. The strongest indication derived from the present
calculations is a serious difficulty to explain the age-invariance of the
cut-off brightness over an extended interval, say from 1 to 13 Gyr, that
observations of PNLFs in galaxies of late-to-early type seem to suggest.

that MassCMO = 10^{7.51\pm 0.06} (MassBul/10^{10}MassSun)^{0.84 \pm 0.06}. We
argue that the linear relation presented by Ferrarese et al. is biased at the
low-mass end by the inclusion of the disc light from lenticular galaxies in
their sample. Matching our NICMOS data with wider-field, ground-based K-band
images enabled us to sample from the nucleus to the disk-dominated region of
each galaxy, and thus to perform a proper bulge-disk decomposition. We found
that the majority of our galaxies (~90%) possess central light excesses which
can be modeled with an inner exponential and/or an unresolved point source in
the case of the nuclear star clusters. All the extended nuclear components,
with sizes of a few hundred pc, have disky isophotes, which suggest that they
may be inner disks, rings, or bars; their colors are redder than those of the
underlying bulge, arguing against a recent origin for their stellar
populations. Surface brightness profiles rise inward to the resolution limit of

brightness profiles spanning ~10 pc to the outer disk. Bulge and disk

Hubble type. Mathematical expressions are given for the stronger relations,

sense, the early-to-intermediate spiral Hubble sequence is scale-free. However,
galaxies themselves are not scale-free, the critical scale being the luminosity
of the bulge. Bulge luminosity is shown to affect the disk parameters, such

disks are exposed to little EUV radiation but a great deal of FUV radiation
from massive stars in the group. This paper calculates mass loss rates for
circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated
large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius exceeds
the critical radius (supercritical disks) where the sound speed in the FUV
heated layer exceeds the escape speed. This paper shows that significant mass
loss still takes place for subcritical systems. Some of the gas extends beyond
the disk edge (above the disk surface) to larger distances where the
temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The
evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the stellar mass and disk radius,
which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines
the temperature structure of the flow. Disks around red dwarfs are readily
evaporated and shrink to disk radii of 15 AU on short time scales (10 Myr) when
exposed to moderate FUV fields with $G_0$ = 3000. Although disks around solar
type stars are more durable, these disks shrink to 15 AU in 10 Myr for intense
FUV radiation fields with $G_0$ = 30,000; such fields exist in the central 0.7
pc of a cluster with N = 4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence
of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune
and Uranus in our solar system are gas poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are gas
rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of
Kuiper belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently
large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low

profile, compared to the EPIC-pn resolution, in five of these quasars.
  The determination of the nature of this broadening (e.g., Keplerian motion, a

communication networks represent a technological challenge. Having no mastering
infrastructure the nodes have to selforganize themselves in such a way that for
example network connectivity, good data traffic performance and robustness are
guaranteed. In this contribution the focus is on routing & congestion control.
First, random data traffic along shortest path routes is studied by simulations
as well as theoretical modeling. Measures of congestion like end-to-end time
delay and relaxation times are given. A scaling law of the average time delay
with respect to network size is revealed and found to depend on the underlying
network topology. In the second step, a distributive routing & congestion
control is proposed. Each node locally propagates its routing cost estimates
and information about its congestion state to its neighbors, which then update
their respective cost estimates. This allows for a flexible adaptation of
end-to-end routes to the overall congestion state of the network. Compared to
shortest-path routing, the critical network load is significantly increased.

the coherent electron motion at large distances dominates the physics, contrary
to the high temperature ($T > g_T \delta $) behavior where conductivity is
controlled by the scales of the order of the grain size. The conductivity of

with decreasing temperature in the same manner as that in homogeneous

an additional contribution to conductivity coming from short distances. Due to
this contribution the metal-insulator transition in three dimensions occurs at
the value of tunnel conductance $g_T^C=(1/6\pi)\ln (E_C/\delta)$, where $E_C$

employment of an algebraic condition $n\cdot A=0$ in the Lagrangian density,
where $A_{\mu}$ is the gauge field (Abelian or non-Abelian) and $n^\mu$ is the
external, light-like, constant vector which defines the gauge proper. However,
this condition though necessary is not sufficient to fix the gauge completely;
there still remains a residual gauge freedom that must be addressed
appropriately. To do this, we need to define the condition $(n\cdot A)(\partial
\cdot A)=0$ with $n\cdot A=0=\partial \cdot A$. The implementation of this
condition in the theory gives rise to a gauge boson propagator (in momentum
space) leading to conspicuous non-local singularities of the type $(k\cdot
n)^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha=1,2$. These singularities must be conveniently
treated, and by convenient we mean not only matemathically well-defined but
physically sound and meaningfull as well. In calculating such a propagator for
one and two noncovariant gauge bosons those singularities demand from the
outset the use of a prescription such as the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (ML) one. We
show that the implementation of the ML prescription does not remove certain
pathologies associated with zero modes. However we present a causal,
singularity-softening prescription and show how to keep causality from being

the restoration of the gauge independence of the physical observables related
to the phenomenon of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in QED3, the chiral condensate

We see in the lack of gauge independence of the physical observables the
necessity of including further gauge invariance constraints and study the gauge
covariance of the Fermion Propagator (FP) through its
Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation. From this we stress that 1) in order
to achieve full gauge independence of the physical observables we must include
the Full Vertex in the corresponding SDE for the FP, and 2) that Perturbation
Theory (PT) is the only scheme where this gauge independence as well as all of
the gauge invariance constraints are satisfied order by order. Therefore we
carry out the construction of the fermion-boson vertex taking PT as a guide
upto the first order of approximation. We completely relate this vertex to the
FP and propose a non perturbative form for it. Furthermore, we write this non
perturbative vertex in a suitable form for its future implementation in similar
studies.

one of the most serious formal drawbacks of the standard Witten's formulation

postulate of absence of poles in superpotentials W(x) over all the real axis of

that it disappears immediately after a suitable (say, constant) shift of the
axis of x into complex plane. Detailed attention is paid to a close

increase of interest in non-Hermitian (a. k. a. PT-symmetric or
pseudo-Hermitian) Hamiltonians. We show that the resulting PT-SUSY
regularization recipe proves both easy and universal. An insight into its
mathematics is mediated by the complex harmonic oscillator with a
centrifugal-like spike. An exhaustive discussion of the role of the strength of
this spike is offered. In addition we recollect the possibility of a
re-formulation of the recipe in the second-order SUSY language. Finally we list

  ""Integrable Systems and Related Topics, July 30-Aug. 1, 2003, Minor changes
  in the figures and the text",,,,"math.AG math.GT nlin.SI",,"  The paper concerns a compactification of the isospectral varieties of
nilpotent Toda lattices for real split simple Lie algebras. The
compactification is obtained by taking the closure of unipotent group orbits in
the flag manifolds. The unipotent group orbits are called the Peterson
varieties and can be used in the complex case to describe the quantum
cohomology of Grassmannian manifolds. We construct a chain complex based on a
cell decomposition consisting of the subsystems of Toda lattices. Explicit
formulae for the incidence numbers of the chain complex are found, and encoded
in a graph containing an edge whenever an incidence number is non-zero. We then
compute rational cohomology, and show that there are just three different
patterns in the calculation of Betti numbers.
  Although these compactified varieties are singular, they resemble certain
smooth Schubert varieties e.g. they both have a cell decomposition consiting of
unipotent group orbits of the same dimensions. In particular, for the case of a
Lie algebra of type $A$ the rational homology/cohomology obtained from the
compactified isospectral variety of the nilpotent Toda lattice equals that of
the corresponding Schubert variety.

Defining an action of the $n \times n$ orthogonal matrices on the space of

throughout the paper, by the apparent suitability of this language to describe

experimental data on dependence of Sh on Re for various ice crystals of
interest in cloud physics have been previously obtained, extrapolation of the
data to smaller particles for Re=0 has been unreliable. We present a simple
computational algorithm for computing Sh at Re=0 for various crystals of
interest, which will allow proper coverage over the whole Re range applicable
to ice crystals. The method we present can be applied to any crystal of
rectilinear shape. The approach was as follows: the model crystal is positioned
in a box and an electric field is applied between the crystal and the box,
simulating the initial growth stage of ice crystals. Using a finite Cartesian
grid system of variable lattice separations, the corners of ice crystal are
assigned to particular lattice points, thereby defining the geometry of the
crystal. A discrete version of Gauss' flux law is developed and used for this
lattice system. Sh (at Re=0) is obtained for hexagonal plates, hexagonal
columns, broad branched crystals, stellar crystals, and capped columns. Our
calculations reveal that our simple computational algorithm provides the values
of Sh for these shapes to within 5% error from the values obtained through
estimates in previous studies.

(Poissonian hot-spot model) and large-scale variations [Kong et al. (2002)] of
the recombination rate influence this decorrelation. We find that the
empirically determined large-scale variations of the recombination rate give
rise to a significantly slower decay of correlations compared to the standard,
unstructured gene-genealogical model assuming constant recombination rate. A
model with long-range recombination-rate variations and with demographic
structure (divergent population) is found to be consistent with the empirically
observed slow decorrelation of gene histories. Conversely, we show that
small-scale recombination-rate fluctuations do not alter the large-scale
decorrelation of gene histories.

interacting with a single-mode radiation field, coupled with a bath of
oscillators. The resulting three-mode dissipative Master equation is solved
analytically in terms of the Wigner function. We examine in details the two
complementary limits of {\em high-Q cavity} and {\em bad-cavity}, the latter
corresponding to the so-called superradiant regime, both in the quasi-classical
and quantum regimes. We found that three-mode entanglement as well as two-mode
atom-atom and atom-radiation entanglement is generally robust against losses

experimental observation of entanglement in condensate systems. In particular,
steady-state entanglement may be obtained both between atoms with opposite
