XMM-Newton observations of galaxy clusters, has led to the development of
several models which explore different heating processes in order to assess if
they can quench the cooling flow. Among the most appealing mechanisms are
thermal conduction and heating through buoyant gas deposited in the ICM by
AGNs. We combine Virgo/M87 observations of three satellites (Chandra,
XMM-Newton and Beppo-SAX) to inspect the dynamics of the ICM in the center of
the cluster. Using the spectral deprojection technique, we derive the physical
quantities describing the ICM and determine the extra-heating needed to balance
the cooling flow assuming that thermal conduction operates at a fixed fraction
of the Spitzer value. We assume that the extra-heating is due to buoyant gas
and we fit the data using the model developed by Ruszkowski and Begelman
(2002). We derive a scale radius for the model of $\sim 5$ kpc, which is
comparable with the M87 AGN jet extension, and a required luminosity of the AGN
of a $few \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to the observed AGN
luminosity. We discuss a scenario where the buoyant bubbles are filled of
relativistic particles and magnetic field responsible for the radio emission in
M87. The AGN is supposed to be intermittent and to inject populations of
buoyant bubbles through a succession of outbursts. We also study the X-ray cool
component detected in the radio lobes and suggest that it is structured in
blobs which are tied to the radio buoyant bubbles.

to the angular power spectrum can only be achieved if radio galaxies possess

sphere. A second, tightly clustered region of density appears in the opposite
hemisphere, at a point antipodal to the centre of the annulus. We argue that
this can be understood in terms of birefringent alterations in the relative
phase of two elliptically polarized propagation modes in the pulsar
magnetosphere (i.e. generalised Faraday rotation). The ellipticity of the modes
implies a significant charge density in the plasma, while the presence of both
senses of circular polarization, and the fact that only one mode shows the
effect, supports the view that refracted ordinary-mode rays are involved in the
production of the annulus. At other pulse longitudes the polarization
(including the circular component) is broadly consistent with an origin in
elliptical OPMs, shown here quantitatively for the first time, however
considerable non-orthogonal contributions serve to broaden the orientation
distribution in an isotropic manner.

isotropic, resulting in only a small transfer of spectral weight from one mode
to another. A comparison of the scattering in these zones to the (110) zone,
where a strong diffuse component is present, reveals a strong coupling of the
diffuse (or central) component to the acoustic mode. We speculate that the
coupling to the central peak is the reason for several recent conflicting
interpretations of the lattice dynamics based on data from zones with a strong
diffuse component.

devoted to the growth and characterization of single crystals of organic
materials and to different techniques that have been developed for device
fabrication. We then concentrate on the measurements of the electrical
characteristics. In most cases, these characteristics are highly reproducible
and demonstrate the quality of the single crystal transistors. Particularly
noticeable are the small sub-threshold slope, the non-monotonic temperature
dependence of the mobility, and its weak dependence on the gate voltage. In the
best rubrene transistors, room-temperature values of $\mu$ as high as 15
cm$^2$/Vs have been observed. This represents an order-of-magnitude increase
with respect to the highest mobility previously reported for organic thin film
transistors. In addition, the highest-quality single-crystal devices exhibit a
significant anisotropy of the conduction properties with respect to the
crystallographic direction. These observations indicate that the field effect
transistors fabricated on single crystals are suitable for the study of the
\textit{intrinsic} electronic properties of organic molecular semiconductors.
We conclude by indicating some directions in which near-future work should

at a fixed rate when the underlying stochastic process remains in some range.
Certain dividend processes exhibiting mean-reverting features can be modelled

self-contained, the emphasis is on communicating the underlying ideas and the
significance of results rather than on presenting systematic derivations and
detailed proofs. (These can be found in the listed references.) The subject can
be approached in different ways. We have chosen one which is deeply rooted in
well established physics and also has sufficient mathematical precision to
ensure that there are no hidden infinities. In order to keep the article to a
reasonable size, and to avoid overwhelming non-experts, we have had to leave
out several interesting topics, results and viewpoints; this is meant to be an
introduction to the subject rather than an exhaustive review of it.

located within small spots, as follows from the observed weakness of
diffractive gluon radiation (smallness of the triple-Pomeron coupling). The
predicted weakness of the leading twist gluon shadowing has been confirmed
recently by data for J/Psi production and Cronin effect in d-Au collisions at
RHIC. Smallness of gluonic spots also leads to a rather low value of the slope
of the Pomeron trajectory, confirmed by ZEUS data on elastic photoproduction of
J/Psi. At the same time, saturation of unitarity for central pp collisions
leads to a substantial increase of the Pomeron slope in good agreement with

presented considering the structure of the instanton induced effects in the

determined by the geometry (branching number) of the tree in a way that
parallels the situation with independent percolation and usual phase transition

y-intercept and slope contribution to ln(F_2) vs. ln(M) from both the
intermittent and null distributions. Statistical power was also assessed for
each fit coefficient to reflect the proportion of times out of 1000 tests each
coefficient was statistically significant, given the induced effect size and
sample size of the Gaussians. Results indicate that the slope of ln(F_2) vs.
ln(M) for intermittent distributions increased with decreasing sample size, due
to artificially-induced holes occurring in sparse histograms. For intermittent
Gaussians with 4000 variates, there was approximately 70% power to detect a
slope difference of 0.02 between intermittent and null distributions. For
sample sizes of 8000 and greater, there was more than 70% power to detect a

the power of the test for intermittency decreased with decreasing sample size.
Power was near-zero when the test was applied to null distributions. The

distribution of total aftershock lifetimes scales as $\sim
1/t^{1+\theta/\gamma}$ when the average branching ratio is critical ($n=1$).
The coefficient $1<\gamma = b/\alpha<2$ quantifies the interplay between the
exponent $b \approx 1$ of the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude distribution $ \sim
10^{-bm}$ and the increase $\sim 10^{\alpha m}$ of the number of aftershocks
with the mainshock magnitude $m$ (productivity) with $\alpha \approx 0.8$. More
generally, our results apply to any stochastic branching process with a
power-law distribution of offsprings per mother and a long memory.

  Italy, September 2003 (eConf0309101)",,,,"physics.acc-ph",,"  One of the key-issues to increase the luminosity in the next generation
particle factories is to reduce the bunch length at the interaction point (IP)
as much as possible. This will allow reducing proportionally the transverse
beta functions at the IP and increasing the luminosity by the same factor. The
strong RF focusing consists in obtaining short bunches by substantially
increasing the lattice momentum compaction and the RF gradient. In this regime
the bunch length is modulated along the ring and could be minimized at the IP.
If the principal impedance generating elements of the ring are located where
the bunch is long (in the RF cavities region) it is possible to avoid microwave
instability and excessive bunch lengthening due to the potential well
distortion.

increment $\Delta(t,r) = \xi(t+r) - \xi(t)$ of a data set $\xi(t)$ as a
stochastic measure, where $r$ denotes the scale. For joint statistics of
$\Delta(t,r)$ and $\Delta(t,r')$ the question how to nest the increments on
different scales $r,r'$ is investigated. Here we show that in some cases
spurious correlations between scales can be introduced by the common
left-justified definition. The consequences for a Markov process are discussed.
These spurious correlations can be avoided by an appropriate nesting of
increments. We demonstrate this effect for different data sets and show how it
can be detected and quantified. The problem allows to propose a unique method
to distinguish between experimental data generated by a noiselike or a
Langevin-like random-walk process, respectively.

eukaryotic cell life. This has motivated a large body of in vitro experiments
measuring polymerization kinetics of individual filaments. Here we model these
kinetics, accounting for all relevant steps revealed by experiment:
polymerization, depolymerization, random ATP hydrolysis and release of
phosphate (Pi). We relate filament growth rates to the dynamics of ATP-actin
and ADP-Pi-actin caps which develop at filament ends. At the critical
concentration of the barbed end, c_crit, we find a short ATP cap and a long
fluctuation-stabilized ADP-Pi cap. We show that growth rates and the critical
concentration at the barbed end are intimately related to cap structure and
dynamics. Fluctuations in filament lengths are described by the length
diffusion coefficient, D. Recently Fujiwara et al. [Nature Cell Biol. (2002) 4,
666] and Kuhn and Pollard [Biohys. J. (2005) 88, 1387] observed large length
fluctuations slightly above c_crit, provoking speculation that growth may
proceed by oligomeric rather than monomeric on-off events. For the single
monomer growth process we find that $D$ exhibits a pronounced peak below
c_crit}, due to filaments alternating between capped and uncapped states, a
mild version of the dynamic instability of microtubules. Fluctuations just
above c_crit are enhanced but much smaller than those reported experimentally.
Future measurements of D as a function of concentration can help identify the
origin of the observed fluctuations.
