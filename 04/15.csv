relative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxy
redshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation and
evolution. In this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis on
galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, classified by both colour and
spectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. We fit three different
models of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cell
counts, assuming Poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. We investigate
the nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells of
side 10Mpc \leq L \leq 45Mpc (h=0.7). Exact linear bias is ruled out with high
significance on all scales. Power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihood
ratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero
`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxy
formation other than those from the local density field. Using this model, we
measure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_LN) of 0.958 for
cells of length L=10Mpc, increasing to 0.970 by L=45Mpc. This corresponds to a
stochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. For
smaller cells, the Poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents an
increasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction of
completely empty cells. We compare these trends with the predictions of
semianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms of
overall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of empty
cells.

nebulae (PNe) and 3 Magellanic Cloud PNe were presented in Paper I by Tsamis et
al. (2003b), who carried out an abundance analysis using the collisionally
excited forbidden lines. Here, the relative intensities of faint optical
recombination lines (ORLs) from ions of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are
analysed in order to derive the abundances of these ions relative to hydrogen.
We define an abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) as the ratio of the abundance
derived for a heavy element ion from its recombination lines to that derived
for the same ion from its ultraviolet, optical or infrared collisionally
excited lines (CELs). All of the PNe in our sample are found to have ADF's that
exceed unity. There is no dependence of the magnitude of the ADF upon the
excitation energy of the UV, optical or IR CEL transition used, indicating that
classical nebular temperature fluctuations--i.e. in a chemically homogeneous
medium--are not the cause of the observed abundance discrepancies. Instead, we
conclude that the main cause of the discrepancy is enhanced ORL emission from
cold ionized gas located in hydrogen-deficient clumps inside the main body of
the nebulae. We have developed a new electron temperature diagnostic, based
upon the relative intensities of the OII 4f-3d 4089A and 3p-3s 4649A
recombination transitions. For six out of eight PNe for which both transitions
are detected, we derive O2+ ORL electron temperatures of <300 K, very much less
than the O2+ forbidden-line and Balmer jump temperatures derived for the same
nebulae. These results provide direct observational evidence for the presence
of H-deficient, cold plasma regions within the nebulae, consistent with gas
cooled largely by infrared fine structure and recombination transitions.

resolution of the order of 1 arcmin, show features of the spectral index
(flattening and patches), which are indication of a complex shape of the
radiating electron spectrum, and are therefore in support of electron
reacceleration models. Regions of flatter spectrum are found to be related to
the recent merger activity in these clusters. This is the first strong
confirmation that the cluster merger supplies energy to the radio halo. In the
undisturbed cluster regions, the spectrum steepens with the distance from the

efficiency, thus allowing us to set constraints on the radial profile of the

transient (SXT) XTE J2123-058 in quiescence, made by Chandra and BeppoSAX, as
well as contemporaneous optical observations. In 2002, the Chandra spectrum of
XTE J2123-058 is consistent with a power-law model, or the combination of a
blackbody plus a power-law, but it is not well-described by a pure blackbody.
Using the interstellar column density, the power-law fit gives photon index of
3.1 (+0.7,-0.6) and indicates a 0.3-8 keV unabsorbed luminosity of 9(+4,-3)E31
(d/8.5 kpc)^2 ergs/s (90% confidence errors). Fits with models consisting of
thermal plus power-law components indicate that the upper limit on the
temperature of a 1.4 solar mass, 10 km radius neutron star with a hydrogen
atmosphere is kT_eff < 66 eV, and the upper limit on the bolometric luminosity
is L_infinity < 1.4E32 ergs/s, assuming d = 8.5 kpc. Of the neutron star SXTs
that exhibit short (< 1 year) outbursts, including Aql X-1, 4U 1608-522, Cen
X-4, and SAX J1810.8-2609, the lowest temperatures and luminosities are found
for XTE J2123-058 and SAX J1810.8-2609. From the BeppoSAX observation of XTE
J2123-058 in 2000, we obtained an upper limit on the 1-10 keV unabsorbed
luminosity of 9E32 ergs/s. Although this upper limit allows that the X-ray
luminosity may have decreased between 2000 and 2002, that possibility is not
supported by our contemporaneous R-band observations, which indicate that the
optical flux increased significantly. Motivated by the theory of deep crustal
heating by Brown and co-workers, we characterize the outburst histories of the
five SXTs. The low quiescent luminosity for XTE J2123-058 is consistent with
the theory of deep crustal heating without requiring enhanced neutron star

anti-correlated with the X-ray, and later more extensive R band photometry
finds a signal at ~2.1 hrs. The earlier reported X-ray periods at ~0.5 and 1

two gas layers or that it is in a sub-kiloparsec disk rotating about the core.

the bright end of this distribution is consistent within statistical and
systematic uncertainties with extrapolation of the universal luminosity
function of HMXBs. However, there seems to be fewer low luminosity sources,

qualitatively explain the observed deficit of low luminosity sources. We found
significant field-to-field variations in the number of HMXBs across the LMC,
which appear to be uncorrelated with the star formation rates inferred by the
FIR and Halpha emission. We suggest that these variations are caused by the
dependence of the HMXB number on the age of the underlying stellar population.

the number of HMXBs as a function of time elapsed since the star formation
event in the range of from 1-2 Myr to 10-12 Myr.

metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). Observations suggest that star
formation in BCDs occurs in two different regimes: ""active"" and ""passive"". The
""active"" BCDs host super star clusters (SSCs), and are characterised by compact
size, rich H2 content, large dust optical depth, and high dust temperature; the
""passive"" BCDs are more diffuse with cooler dust, and lack SSCs and large
amounts of H2. By treating physical processes concerning formation of stars and
dust, we are able to simultaneously reproduce all the above properties of both
modes of star formation (active and passive). We find that the difference
between the two regimes can be understood through the variation of the
""compactness"" of the star-forming region: an ""active"" mode emerges if the
region is compact (with radius $\la 50$ pc) and dense (with gas number density
$\ga 500$ cm$^{-3}$). The dust, supplied from Type II supernovae in a compact
star-forming region, effectively reprocesses the heating photons into the
infrared and induces a rapid H2 formation over a period of several Myr. This
explains the high infrared luminosity, high dust temperature, and large H2
content of active BCDs. Moreover, the gas in ""active"" galaxies cools ($\la 300$
K) on a few dynamical timescales, producing a ""run-away"" star formation episode
because of the favourable (cool) conditions. The mild extinction and relatively
low molecular content of passive BCDs can also be explained by the same model
if we assume a diffuse region (with radius $\ga 100$ pc and gas number density
$\la 100$ cm$^{-3}$). We finally discuss primordial star formation in
high-redshift galaxies in the context of the ""active"" and ""passive"" star

sources of radiation that reionised hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM)
at redshift z~6. Observations at lower redshifts indicate that only a small
fraction, f_esc, of hydrogen ionising radiation emitted from massive stars can
escape unabsorbed by the galaxy into the IGM. High redshift galaxies are
expected to be more compact and gas rich than present day galaxies,
consequently f_esc from their disks or spheroids might have been very small.
But if the sites of star formation in the galaxies are off-centre and if the
star formation efficiency of the proto-clusters is high, then the mean f_esc
calculated for these objects only, is expected to be close to unity.
  Here I argue that this mode of star formation is consistent with several
models for globular clusters formation. Using simple arguments based on the
observed number of globular cluster systems in the local universe and assuming
that the oldest globular clusters formed before reionisation and had f_esc~1, I
show that they produced enough ionising photons to reionise the IGM at z~6. I
also enphasize that globular cluster formation might have been the dominant
mode of star formation at redshifts from 6 to 12.

at 6.7 micron we have discovered objects with exceptional mid-infrared (MIR)

have found AGN with a pronounced MIR emission, probably due to circum-nuclear
dust. First results from optical spectroscopy of ten candidates corroborate
this interpretation showing four AGN, two reddened LINER and four extremely

in Supernova Remnants (SNRs), to the diffuse high energy \gr emission above 1
GeV from the Galactic disk is studied. The \grs produced by the SCRs have a
much harder spectrum than those generated by the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs).
Extending a previous paper, a simple SNR population synthesis is considered and
the Inverse Compton emission from the SCR electrons is evaluated in greater
detail. Then the combined spectrum of \gr emission from the Galactic Supernova
Remnant population is calculated and this emission at low Galactic latitudes is
compared with the diffuse \gr emission observed by the EGRET and ground based
instruments. The average contribution of SCRs is comparable to the GCR
contribution already at GeV energies, due to Supernovae of types II and Ib
exploding into the wind bubbles of quite massive progenitor stars, and becomes
dominant at \gr energies above 100 GeV. At TeV energies the dominant
contribution is from SCRs in SNRs that expand into a uniform interstellar
medium. In fact, the sum of hadronic and Inverse Compton \grs would exceed the
limits given by the existing experimental data, unless the confinement time
$T_{SN}$, i.e. the time until which SNRs confine the main fraction of
accelerated SCRs, is as small as $T_{SN}\sim 10^4$ yr and the typical magnetic
field strength in SNRs as large as 30 $\mu$G. Both situations are however
possible as a result of field amplification through CR backreaction in the
acceleration process. It is pointed out that accurate measurements of the
low-latitude diffuse Galactic \gr spectrum at TeV-energies can serve as a
unique consistency test for CR origin from the Supernova Remnant population as
a whole.

obtained, namely a Brinkman-Rice transition at commensurate fillings together
with a ``preformed'' Mott gap in the single-particle density of states. The
slave- rotor formalism allows to go beyond the local description and take into
account spatial correlations, following an analogy to the superfluid-insulator
transition of bosonic systems. We find that the divergence of the effective
mass at the metal- insulator transition is suppressed by short range magnetic
correlations in finite-dimensional systems. Furthermore, the strict separation
of energy scales between the Fermi- liquid coherence scale and the Mott gap
found in the local picture, holds only approximately in finite dimensions, due
to the existence of low-energy collective modes related to zero-sound.

increasing the temperature and/or the magnetic field. The phase diagram for
BSCCO is obtained for different values of the anisotropy parameter $\gamma$.
The best fit to the experimental results of D. Majer {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 75}, 1166 (1995)] is obtained for $\gamma\approx 250$ provided one
assumes a temperature dependence $\lambda^2(0)/\lambda^2(T)=1-t$ of the
penetration depth with $t=T/T_c$. Assuming a dependence
$\lambda^2(0)/\lambda^2(T)=1-t^2$ the best fit is obtained for $ \gamma\approx
450$. For finite anisotropy the data is shown to collapse on a straight line
when plotted in dimensionless units which shows that the melting transition can
be satisfied with a single Lindemann parameter whose value is about 0.3. A
different scaling applies to the $\gamma=\infty$ case. The energy jump is
measured across the transition and for large values of $\gamma$ it is found to
increase with increasing anisotropy and to decrease with increasing magnetic
field. For infinite anisotropy we see a 2D behavior of flux droplets with a
transition taking place at a temperature independent of the magnetic field. We
also show that for smaller values of anisotropy it is reasonable to replace the
electromagnetic coupling with an in-plane interaction represented by a Bessel
function of the second kind ($K_0$), thus justifying our claim in a previous
paper.

non-perturbative gauge fixing to the non-abelian case. A key ingredient is that
fermion doublers can be avoided at a novel type of critical point which is only
accessible through gauge fixing, as we have shown before in the abelian case.
The new ingredient allowing us to deal with the non-abelian case as well is the
use of equivariant gauge fixing, which handles Gribov copies correctly, and
avoids Neuberger's no-go theorem. We use this method in order to gauge fix the
non-abelian group (which we will take to be SU(N)) down to its maximal abelian
subgroup. Obtaining an undoubled, chiral fermion content requires us to
gauge-fix also the remaining abelian gauge symmetry. This modifies the
equivariant BRST identities, but their use in proving unitarity remains intact,
as we show in perturbation theory. On the lattice, equivariant BRST symmetry as
well as the abelian gauge invariance are broken, and a judiciously chosen
irrelevant term must be added to the lattice gauge-fixing action in order to
have access to the desired critical point in the phase diagram. We argue that
gauge invariance is restored in the continuum limit by adjusting a finite
number of counter terms. We emphasize that weak-coupling perturbation theory
applies at the critical point which defines the continuum limit of our lattice
chiral gauge theory.

of larger noise, the second moment is calculated using a different approach,

of the noise, and the magnitude of the noise. We determine a critical value for
noise strength, as a function of the unperturbed system's convergence rate,

In this case R_Z is called an E-group. Obvious examples of E-rings are subrings
of Q. However there is a proper class of examples constructed recently. E-rings
come up naturally in various topics of algebra. This also led to a
generalization: an abelian group G is an E-group if there is an epimorphism
from G onto the additive group of End(G). If G is torsion-free of finite rank,
then G is an E-group if and only if it is an E-group. The obvious question was
raised a few years ago which we will answer by showing that the two notions do
not coincide. We will apply combinatorial machinery to non-commutative rings to
produce an abelian group G with (non-commutative) End(G) and the desired
epimorphism with prescribed kernel H. Hence, if we let H=0, we obtain a

of stability theory for K_{s(+l)} for l<n not too large. Characteristically
from time to time we have to increase n relative to l to get our desirable
properties; we do not critically mind the exact n, so one may think of an
omega-successful s. A posteriori we are interested in the model theory of such
classes K_s per-se, and see as a test for this theory, that in the
omega-successful case we can understand also the model in higher cardinals,
e.g., prove that K^s_mu is not empty for every mu>=lambda. Recall there are
reasonable lambda-frames which are not n-excellent but still we can say alot on
models in $K_{s(+l)} for l<n. Moving from lambda to lambda^+ we would have
preferred not to restrict ourselves to saturated models but at present we do
not know it. However, in the omega-excellent case we can understand the class
of lambda^{+omega}--saturated models in $K_s$, i.e., K^{s(+omega)}. This fits
well the thesis that it is reasonable to first analyze the quite saturated
case.

their energies. Their statistics shows that although there are far less
breathers than phonons, there are much more above the activation energy, being
therefore a good candidate to explain the reconstructive transformations at low
temperature.

long-term observations of spontaneous activity of in-vitro cortical networks,
which differ from predictions of current models in many features. In this paper
we generalize the EI cortical model introduced in a previous paper (S.Scarpetta
et al. Neural Comput. 14, 2002), including intrinsic white noise and analyzing
effects of noise on the spontaneous activity of the nonlinear system, in order
to account for the experimental results of Segev et al.. Analytically we can
distinguish different regimes of activity, depending from the model parameters.
Using analytical results as a guide line, we perform simulations of the
nonlinear stochastic model in two different regimes, B and C. The Power
Spectrum Density (PSD) of the activity and the Inter-Event-Interval (IEI)
distributions are computed, and compared with experimental results. In regime B
the network shows stochastic resonance phenomena and noise induces aperiodic
collective synchronous oscillations that mimic experimental observations at 0.5
mM Ca concentration. In regime C the model shows spontaneous synchronous
periodic activity that mimic activity observed at 1 mM Ca concentration and the
PSD shows two peaks at the 1st and 2nd harmonics in agreement with experiments
at 1 mM Ca. Moreover (due to intrinsic noise and nonlinear activation function
effects) the PSD shows a broad band peak at low frequency. This feature,
observed experimentally, does not find explanation in the previous models.
Besides we identify parametric changes (namely increase of noise or decreasing
of excitatory connections) that reproduces the fading of periodicity found
experimentally at long times, and we identify a way to discriminate between
those two possible effects measuring experimentally the low frequency PSD.
