which are characteristic of energetic, rotation-powered pulsars. Using the MDM
2.4m telescope we obtain upper limits in the optical at the position of the
point source, (J2000) 00h07m01.56s, +73o03'08.1"", determined to an accuracy of
0.1"", of B>25.4, V>24.8, R>25.1, and I>23.7; these correspond to an
X-ray-to-optical flux ratio >100. Neither a VLA image at 1425 MHz, nor a deep
pulsar search at 820 MHz using the NRAO Green Bank Telescope, reveal a radio
pulsar counterpart to an equivalent luminosity limit at 1400 MHz of 0.02 mJy
kpc^2, which is equal to the lowest luminosity known for any radio pulsar. The
Chandra point source accounts for about 30% of the flux of RX J0007.0+7303,
while its compact nebula plus jet comprise about 70%. The X-ray spectrum of the
point source is fitted with a power-law plus blackbody model with Gamma =
1.6+/-0.6, kT_{infty} = 0.13+/-0.05 keV, and R_infty = 0.37 km, values typical
of a young pulsar. An upper limit of T^{infty}_e < 6.6x10^5 K to the effective
temperature of the entire neutron star surface is derived, which is one of the
most constraining data points on cooling models. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity of
RX J0007.0+7303 is 4x10^{31}(d/1.4 kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}, but the larger ~18'
diameter synchrotron nebula in which it is embedded is two orders of magnitude
more luminous. These properties allow us to estimate, albeit crudely, that the
spin-down luminosity of the underlying pulsar is in the range 10^{36}-10^{37}
ergs s^{-1}, and support the identification of the high-energy gamma-ray source
3EG J0010+7309 as a pulsar even though its spin parameters have not yet been

hierarchically from small to large scales. Much of this evolution occurs very
slowly but at a few special times more, rapid, violent activity may occur as
major subunits collide at high velocities. The Abell 2125 complex (z=0.247)
appears to be undergoing such an event as shown by modeling of the optical
velocity field and by the detection with the VLA of an unusually large number
of associated radio active galaxies. We present an 80 ksec Chandra imaging of
Abell 2125, together with extensive complementary multi-wavelength data. We
show direct evidence for galaxy transformation and destruction during the
cluster formation. The Chandra data unambiguously separate the X-ray
contributions from discrete sources and large-scale diffuse gas in the Abell
2125 complex, which consists of various merging clusters/groups of galaxies and
low-surface brightness emission. This enables us to study processes affecting
galaxy evolution during this special time from scales of Mpc down to a few kpc.
The overall level of activity plus the special time for the cluster-cluster
merger suggests that an important phase of galaxy evolution can take place
during such events.

the intergalactic medium by an early population of accreting black holes. By
considering observational constraints from the X-ray background, we find an
upper limit for the optical depth to Thompson scattering tau_e~0.17. The
redshifted soft X-ray background from these early sources produces:(i) fully
ionised atomic hydrogen in the low density intergalactic medium before redshift
z~7 (consequently stellar reionisation is characterised by an instantaneous
overlap phase of HII regions),(ii) a second HeII reionisation at z~3 and (iii)
heats the intergalactic medium to near 10000 K at low redshifts. The typical
luminosity in the soft X-ray band of the galaxies hosting the black holes is
about one order of magnitude below the sensitivity limit of the Chandra deep
field. About a thousand of these sources may be present per square arcmin of
the sky, producing detectable fluctuations. Few rarer objects could be luminous
enough to be visible in the Chandra deep field. XEUS and Con-X satellites will
be able to detect more of these sources that, if radio loud, could be used to
study the 21cm forest in absorption.A signature of an early X-ray preionisation
is the production of secondary CMB anisotropies on small angular scales. We
find that in these models the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations
increases with decreasing angular scale (dT~16 muK at 1arcsec scales), while
for stellar reionisation scenarios the power decreases on smaller scales. We
also show that the redshifted 21 cm radiation from neutral hydrogen can be
marginally detected in emission at redshifts 7<z<12. At a redshift of about
z~30 a stronger and narrower (in redshift space) signal in absorption against
the CMB, that is peculiar to these models,could be detectable.[abridged]

which is free from any influence of external circumstances, I have studied the
structure of spontaneous reconnection outflow using a shock tube approximation.
The reconnection system of this case continues to expand self-similarly. This
work aims 1) to solve the structure of reconnection outflow and 2) to clarify
the determination mechanism of reconnection rate of the ``self-similar
evolution model'' of fast reconnection.
  Many cases of reconnection in astrophysical phenomena are characterized by a
huge dynamic range of expansion in size ($\sim 10^7$ for typical solar flares).
Although such reconnection is intrinsically time dependent, a specialized model
underlying the situation has not been established yet.
  The theoretical contribution of this paper is in obtaining a solution for
outflow structure which is absent in our previous papers proposing the above
new model. The outflow has a shock tube-like structure, i.e., forward slow
shock, reverse fast shock and contact discontinuity between them. By solving
the structure in a sufficiently wide range of plasma-$\beta$: $0.001 \leq \beta
\leq 100$, we obtain an almost constant reconnection rate ($\sim 0.05$: this
value is the maximum for spontaneous reconnection and is consistent with
previous models) and a boundary value along the edge of the outflow (good
agreement with our simulation result) which is important to solve the inflow
region. Note that everything, including the reconnection rate, is spontaneously
determined by the reconnection system itself in our model.

issue, here the navigation process of launching messages toward designated
targets is investigated on a variant of the one-dimensional small-world network
(SWN). In the network structure considered, the probability of a shortcut
falling between a pair of nodes is proportional to $r^{-\alpha}$, where $r$ is
the lattice distance between the nodes. When $\alpha =0$, it reduces to the SWN
model with random shortcuts. The system shows the dynamic small-world (SW)
effect, which is different from the well-studied static SW effect. We study the
effective network diameter, the path length as a function of the lattice
distance, and the dynamics. They are controlled by multiple parameters, and we
use data collapse to show that the parameters are correlated. The central
finding is that, in the one-dimensional network studied, the dynamic SW effect
exists for $0\leq \alpha \leq 2$. For each given value of $\alpha $ in this

the recently discovered anomalous low-field magnetoresistance is developed for
the system of two-dimensional electrons scattered by hard disks of radius $a,$

magentoresistance is found to be parabolic and inversely proportional to the

promising recent attempt (hep-th/0304256) to naturally understand the observed
dark energy density, and this connection with dark energy prevents making the
extra dimensions smaller than of order 5 $\mu$m. The resulting inability to
change this size makes the model very predictive, and easily falsifiable within
the near future. Being supersymmetric, it may plausibly be embedded into a more
fundamental theory such as string theory, in which case an additional 4 compact
dimensions may also be present having inverse radii at the TeV scale or higher.

isomorphic subgroups of the Dirac algebra, which, being a Clifford algebra,
gives a geometric nature to the generators, in particular to C. It turns out
that G_1 is isomorphic to D_8 x Z_2, where D_8 is the dihedral group of eight

isomorphic to Q x Z_2, where Q is the quaternion group. This group, however, is
compatible only with the second of the above two matrix solutions, namely with

holds for weighted projective planes. Moreover, we also show that this mirror

two pseudorapidity bins. We measured dN/deta distributions and truncated mean
p_T in a region of p_T > p_T^cut, and studied the results in the framework of
participant and binary scaling. No clear evidence is observed for participant
scaling of charged hadron yield in the measured p_T region. The relative
importance of hard scattering process is investigated through binary scaling

the amount of communication needed for distributed computational tasks. An
intriguing question is why quantum mechanics does not allow these more powerful

placing them within a wider context. With this in mind, we investigate the set
of correlations that are constrained only by the no-signalling principle. These
correlations form a polytope, which contains the quantum correlations as a
(proper) subset. We determine the vertices of the no-signalling polytope in the
case that two observers each choose from two possible measurements with d
