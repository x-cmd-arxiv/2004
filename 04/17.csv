the formation and evolution of bars in the formation and evolution of galaxies,
we have developed a diagnostic tool to distinguish between recently formed and
evolved bars. Our method was applied in the study of a sample of 14 galaxies
and revealed that, apparently, AGN activity tends to appear in galaxies which
have young bars rather than evolved bars. This suggests that the time scale for
the fueling of AGN by bars is short, and may help to explain, for instance, why
there is not a clear correlation between the presence of bars and AGN in
galaxies.

(mass segregated), NGC3680 does not present strong signs of dissolution. On the
other hand, NGC2180 presents flat, eroded LFs throughout its structure,
indicating that in addition to mass segregation, Galactic tidal stripping has
been effective in depleting this cluster of stars. Accordingly, NGC2180 may be
the missing link between evolved open clusters and remnants. We study both
clusters in the context of dynamical states estimated from diagnostic-diagrams
involving photometric and structural parameters. Both clusters are dynamically
evolved systems. In particular, NGC2180 is closer to open cluster remnants than
NGC3680.

marginally unstable, uniformly rotating star spinning at the mass-shedding
limit depends critically on the equation of state. For a very stiff equation of
state, which is likely to characterize a neutron star, essentially all of the
mass and angular momentum of the progenitor are swallowed by the Kerr black
hole formed during the collapse, leaving nearly no residual gas to form a disk.
For a soft equation of state with an adiabatic index \Gamma - 4/3 << 1, which
characterizes a very massive or supermassive star supported predominantly by
thermal radiation pressure, as much as 10% of the mass of the progenitor avoids
capture and goes into a disk about the central hole. We present a semi-analytic
calculation that corroborates these numerical findings and shows how the final
outcome of such a collapse may be determined from simple physical
considerations. In particular, we employ a simple energy variational principle
with an approximate, post-Newtonian energy functional to determine the
structure of a uniformly rotating, polytropic star at the onset of collapse as
a function of polytropic index n, where \Gamma = 1+1/n. We then use this data
to calculate the mass and spin of the final black hole and ambient disk. We
show that the fraction of the total mass that remains in the disk falls off
sharply as 3-n (equivalently, \Gamma - 4/3) increases.

these mass profiles are consistent with independent mass estimates from X-ray

these clusters, suggesting that dense cluster cores are less efficient at
forming galaxies and/or more efficient at disrupting them. At large radii,
galaxy populations in cluster infall regions closely resemble those in the

because rotation is more dominant in the CS envelope than the C18O envelope, in

the possibility to perform time-resolved experiments (below 1 ns) on

  Resonant photon absorption in the GHz range was observed via low temperature
micro-SQUID magnetization measurements of the spin ground state S = 1/2 of the
molecular complex V15. The line-width essentially results from intra-molecular
hyperfine interaction. The results point out that observing Rabi oscillations
in molecular nanomagnets requires well isolated low spin systems and high

of quantum superposition of spin-up and spin-down states in SMMs.

two-dimensional electrons in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure in regime of
Microwave-Induced Resistance Oscillations (MIROs). It is shown that the
electrodynamic aspect of the problem is important in these experiments. In the
absorption experiments a broad cyclotron resonance line was observed due to a
large reflection from the highly conductive electron gas. There were no
additional features observed related to absorption at harmonics of the
cyclotron resonance. In near-field reflection experiments a very different
oscillation pattern was revealed when compared to MIROs. The oscillation
pattern observed in the reflection experiments is probably due to plasma
effects occurring in a finite-size sample. The whole microscopic picture of
MIROs is more complicated than simply a resonant absorption at harmonics of the
cyclotron resonance. Nevertheless, the experimental observations are in good
agreement with the model by Ryzhii et al. involving the photo-assisted
scattering in the presence of a crossed magnetic field and dc bias. The
observed damping factor of MIROs may be attributed to a change in the electron
mobility as a function of temperature.

papers) that should be imposed on Wick products and time-ordered products of a
free quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. These conditions arise from a
simple ``Principle of Perturbative Agreement'': For interaction Lagrangians
$L_1$ that are such that the interacting field theory can be constructed
exactly--as occurs when $L_1$ is a ``pure divergence'' or when $L_1$ is at most
quadratic in the field and contains no more than two derivatives--then
time-ordered products must be defined so that the perturbative solution for
interacting fields obtained from the Bogoliubov formula agrees with the exact
solution. The conditions derived from this principle include a version of the
Leibniz rule (or ``action Ward identity'') and a condition on time-ordered
products that contain a factor of the free field $\phi$ or the free
stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$. The main results of our paper are (1) a proof
that in spacetime dimensions greater than 2, our new conditions can be
consistently imposed in addition to our previously considered conditions and
(2) a proof that, if they are imposed, then for {\em any} polynomial
interaction Lagrangian $L_1$ (with no restriction on the number of derivatives
appearing in $L_1$), the stress-energy tensor $\Theta_{ab}$ of the interacting
theory will be conserved. Our work thereby establishes (in the context of
perturbation theory) the conservation of stress-energy for an arbitrary
interacting scalar field in curved spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. Our
approach requires us to view time-ordered products as maps taking classical
field expressions into the quantum field algebra rather than as maps taking
Wick polynomials of the quantum field into the quantum field algebra.

For these quasi-D Kasner models we first investigate the modification to the
principal null directions, then a Teukolsky Master Equation for fields of any
spin, considering in particular the quasi-D models as curvature perturbations
of the type D background. Considering the speciality index and the principal
null directions and comparing the results for the exact solutions and those for
the perturbative ones, this simple Kasner example allows us to clarify that
perturbed spacetime do not retain in general the speciality character of the
background. There are four distinct principal null directions, although they
are not necessarily first order perturbations of the background principal null
directions, as our example of the quasi-D Kasner models shows.
  For the quasi-D Kasner models the use of a Teukolsky Master Equation, a
classical tool for studying black hole perturbations, allows us to show, from a
completely new point of view, the well known absence of gravitational waves in
Kasner spacetimes. This result, used together with an explicit expression of
the electric Weyl tensor in terms of Weyl scalars, provides an example of the
fact that the presence of transverse curvature terms does not necessarily imply
the presence of gravitational waves.

proper analysis. Here the analysis is put forward: It is proved that, as far as
the weak energy condition is satisfied outside the shell, the collapsing shell
bounces back at some point irrespective of the initial conditions, and escapes
from the singularity formation.
  The behavior after the bounce depends on the sign of the shell pressure in
the z-direction. When the pressure is non-negative, the shell continues to
expand without re-contraction. On the other hand, when the pressure is negative
(i.e. it has a tension), the behavior after the bounce can be more complicated
depending on the details of the model. However, even in this case, the shell

shown to be satisfied if and only if $n$ is prime. We prove that the commuting

(modulo isomorphisms). In particular, they are finiteley many for any fixed
dimension. Also, we give a conceptual proof of previous constructions of

finiteness means that Lipschitz functions on an arbitrary subset of M can be
linearly extended to functions on M whose Lipschitz constants are enlarged by a

arbitrary combinations of these objects. On the other hand we construct an
example of a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold M of bounded geometry for

particles it is useful to look at other systems with many degrees of freedom.
An interesting example is the high-dimensional Lorentz gas, which, just like a
system of moving hard spheres, may be interpreted as a dynamical system
consisting of a point particle in a high-dimensional phase space, moving among
fixed scatterers. In this paper, we calculate the full spectrum of Lyapunov
exponents for the dilute random Lorentz gas in an arbitrary number of
dimensions. We find that the spectrum becomes flatter with increasing
dimensionality. Furthermore, for fixed collision frequency the separation
between the largest Lyapunov exponent and the second largest one increases
logarithmically with dimensionality, whereas the separations between Lyapunov
exponents of given indices not involving the largest one, go to fixed limits.

meme as smallest information unit in cultural evolution in general, but it is
the smallest information we use on explaining cultural evolution. We construct
a computational model and do simulation in advance presenting the selfish meme

presented. Due to miniaturization, the amount of material needed for the
optical system is minimal. Because it is light-weight and flexible, it can
easily be attached to the land or existing structures. This presents an
economic advantage over conventional concentrators which require the
construction of a separate structure to support them, and motors to orient them
to intercept and properly reflect sunlight. Such separate structures must be
able to survive gusts, windstorms, earthquakes, etc. This concentrator utilizes
the ground or existing edifices which are already capable of withstanding such
vicissitudes of nature.

equilibrium as balance of the thermodynamic forces. Based on the linear
equations of irreversible thermodynamics, De Donder definition of the
thermodynamic force, and Le Chatelier's principle, new thermodynamics of
chemical equilibrium offers an explicit account for multiple chemical
interactions within the system. Basic relations between energetic
characteristics of chemical transformations and reaction extents are based on
the idea of chemical equilibrium as balance between internal and external
thermodynamic forces, which is presented in the form of a logistic equation,
containing only one new parameter. Solutions to the basic equation define the
domain of states of the chemical system, from true equilibrium to true chaos.
The new theory is derived exclusively from the currently recognized ideas and
covers equilibrium thermodynamics as well as non-equilibrium thermodynamics in
a unique concept.

understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their
behavior. Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to
have a correct model. As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and
modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced. One example of
large and complex networks involves protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
We demonstrate that the currently popular scale-free model of PPI networks
fails to fit the data in several respects. We show that a random geometric
model provides a much more accurate model of the PPI data.
