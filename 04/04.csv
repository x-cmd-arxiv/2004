energy photons arising in gamma-ray burst internal shocks, using exact
cross-sections for the relevant processes. We find that for reasonable choices
of parameters, photons in the range of 10's to 100's of GeV may be emitted in
the prompt phase. Photons above this range are subject to electron-positron
pair production with fireball photons and would be absent from the spectrum
escaping the gamma-ray burst. We find that, in such cases, the fireball becomes
optically thin again at ultra-high energies ($\gtrsim$ PeV). On the other hand,
for sufficiently large fireball bulk Lorentz factors, the fireball is optically
thin at all energies. Both for $\gamma\gamma$ self-absorbed and optically thin
cases, the escaping high energy photons can interact with infra-red and
microwave background photons to produce delayed secondary photons in the
GeV-TeV range. These may be observable with GLAST, or at low redshifts with
ground-based air Cherenkov telescopes. Detection of the primary prompt spectrum
constrains the bulk Lorentz factor, while detection of delayed secondary
gamma-rays would provide a consistency check for the primary spectrum and the
bulk Lorentz factor as well as constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field
strength.

the Bragg excitation spectrum for a condensate in a harmonic trap supports a

a correlation between the number of radial modes and the number of bound states

the outstanding questions yet to be answered by modern cosmology and also one
of only a handful of problems where the need of a larger number of degrees of
freedom than those contained in the standard model (SM) is better illustrated.
An appealing scenario for the generation of baryon number is the electroweak
phase transition that took place when the temperature of the universe was about
100 GeV. Though in the minimal version of the SM, and without considering the
interaction of the SM particles with additional degrees of freedom, this
scenario has been ruled out given the current bounds for the Higgs mass, this
still remains an open possibility in supersymmetric extensions of the SM. In
recent years it has also been realized that large scale magnetic fields could
be of primordial origin. A natural question is what effect, if any, these
fields could have played during the electroweak phase transition in connection
to the generation of baryon number. Prior to the electroweak symmetry breaking,
the magnetic modes able to propagate for large distances belonged to the U(1)
group of hypercharge and hence receive the name of hypermagnetic fields. In
this contribution, we summarize recent work aimed to explore the effects that
these fields could have introduced during a first order electroweak phase
transition. In particular, we show how these fields induce a CP asymmetric
scattering of fermions off the true vacuum bubbles nucleated during the phase
transition. The segregated axial charge acts as a seed for the generation of
baryon number. We conclude by mentioning possible research venues to further
explore the effects of large scale magnetic fields for the generation of the
baryon asymmetry.

  conference","J.Phys.G30:S667-S674,2004","10.1088/0954-3899/30/8/004",,"nucl-ex",,"  BRAHMS has the ability to study relativistic heavy ion collisions from the
final freeze-out of hadrons all the way back to the initial wave-function of
the gold nuclei. This is accomplished by studying hadrons with a very wide
range of momenta and angles. In doing so we can scan various phases of QCD,
from a hadron gas, to a quark gluon plasma and perhaps to a color glass
condensate.

the competing effects due to suppression of zeroth order gluon radiation bellow
the plasma frequency and the enhancement of gluon radiation due to transition
energy loss and medium induced Bremsstrahlung. Heavy quark medium induced
radiative energy loss is derived to all orders in opacity, $(L/\lambda_g)^n$.
Numerical evaluation of the energy loss suggest small suppression of high
$p_\perp$ charm quarks, and therefore provide a possible explanation for the
null effects observed by PHENIX in the prompt electron spectrum in $Au+Au$ as
$\sqrt{s}=130$ and 200 AGeV.

synthesized new element 115, $^{287}115$ and $^{288}115$, have been calculated
theoretically within the WKB approximation using microscopic $\alpha$-nucleus
interaction potentials obtained by folding in the densities of the $\alpha$ and
the daughter nuclei with a realistic effective interaction. M3Y effective
interaction, supplemented by a zero-range pseudo-potential for exchange along
with the density dependence, has been used for calculating the nuclear
interaction potentials. Spherical charge distributions have been used for
calculating the Coulomb interaction potentials. These calculations provide
consistent estimates for the lifetimes of the consecutive $\alpha$ decay chains
of the superheavy element 115.

Rev. Lett. {\bf 83} (5) (1999) 1054) concerning the separability of very noisy
mixed states represented by general density matrices with the form
$\rho_\epsilon = (1-\epsilon)M_d+\epsilon\rho_1$. From a detailed numerical
analysis, it is shown that: (1) there exist infinite values in the interval
taken for the density matrix expansion coefficients, $-1\le
c_{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_N}\le 1$, which give rise to {\em non-physical density
matrices}, with trace equal to 1, but at least one {\em negative} eigenvalue;
(2) there exist entangled matrices outside the predicted entanglement region,
and (3) there exist separable matrices inside the same region. It is also shown
that the lower and upper bounds of $\epsilon$ depend on the coefficients of the
expansion of $\rho_1$ in the Pauli basis. If $\rho_{1}$ is hermitian with trace
equal to 1, but is allowed to have {\em negative} eigenvalues, it is shown that
$\rho_\epsilon$ can be entangled, even for two qubits.
