the Poisson equation, which implies a scale-dependent growth of overdensities

as a map-making method. In this method a noise estimate based on destriped

effect related to the distribution of detector pointings, which affects the
high multipole part of the power spectrum. We correct for this by subtracting a
``signal bias'' estimated by MC simulations. We also give analytical estimates
for this signal bias. Our method is fast and accurate enough (the estimator is

although the degree of magnetization of the ejecta is unknown. We derive a
rigorous analytical solution for the relativistic 90 degree shocks under the
ideal MHD condition, and use them to study the reverse shock emission
properties of an arbitrarily magnetized ejecta. Contrary to the previous
belief, we find that strong relativistic shocks still exist in the high-sigma
limit. Assuming a constant density of the circumburst medium, we study the
shell-medium interaction in detail and categorize various critical radii for
shell evolution. With typical GRB parameters, a reverse shock exists when sigma
is less than a few tens or a few hundreds. The shell evolution can be still
categorized into the thick and thin shell regimes, but the separation between
the two regime now depends on sigma and the thick shell regime greatly shrinks
at high-sigma. The early optical afterglow lightcurves are calculated for GRBs
with a wide range of the sigma values. We find that the reverse shock emission
level increases steadily with sigma initially, but starts to decline when sigma
becomes larger than unity. In the high-sigma regime the reverse shock peak is
usually broadened due to the separation of the shock crossing radius and the
deceleration radius in the thin shell regime. The early afterglow data and
tight upper limits of known GRBs could be understood within the theoretical
framework developed in this paper, with the inferred sigma value varying in a
wide range.

regarding the density distributions of dark matter haloes. On larger scales ($r
\ga 2.0\mpch$) the results are very sensitive to the abundance of the few most
prominant haloes. Using the conditional luminosity function, we also construct
models for the 3PCF of galaxies, which we test against large mock galaxy
samples. The bias of the galaxy distrubution with respect to the dark matter,
and the finite number of galaxies that can be hosted by individual haloes,
significantly reduce the normalized three-point correlation function with
respect to that of dark matter. Contrary to the 3PCF of the dark matter, the
galaxy 3PCF is much less sensitive to details regarding the spatial number
density distribution of galaxies in individual haloes or to the abundance of
the few most massive systems. Finally, we show that our model based on the

reproduces the observational finding that the 3PCF for early-type galaxies is
slightly higher than that of late-type galaxies, and that there is no

developments of new X-ray bright spots in the northwestern and the southwestern
portions of the remnant as well as changes on the eastern side. The latest
0.5-2 keV band flux ($f_X$ $\sim$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$

emission is primarily from the blast wave shock with $kT$ $\sim$ 2.4 keV. As
the blast wave approaches the dense circumstellar material, the contribution
from the decelerated slow shock ($kT$ $\sim$ 0.22 keV) to the observed X-ray
emission is becoming significant. The increase of this slow shock contribution
over the last two years is particularly noticeable in the western half of the
remnant. These results indicate that the shock front is now reaching the main
body of the inner circumstellar ring. Based on the best-fit two-shock spectral
model, we derive approximate densities of the X-ray-emitting regions ($n_e$
$\sim$ 235 cm$^{-3}$ for the fast shock and $n_e$ $\sim$ 7500 cm$^{-3}$ for the

determine the systemic velocity in the plane of the sky to be V_iss ~ 140.9 +/-

respect to the line of nodes of the pulsar's orbit are V_plane ~ 96.0 +/- 3.7

that pulsar B was born with a kick speed of >~ 100 km/s. Future VLBA
determination of the angular proper motion in conjunction with improved V_iss
measurements should provide a precise distance to the system. Using
high-precision timing data and the V_iss model, we estimate a best-fit orbital

extinction laws, characterized by parameters [R_V, E(B-V)] ~ [0.7, 0.14], [1.9,

(MHD) simulations of collapsars including a rotating black hole. This paper is
an extension of our previous paper (Mizuno et al. 2004). The current
calculation focuses on the effect of black hole rotation using general
relativistic MHD with simplified microphysics. Initially, we assume that the
core collapse is failed in this star. A few solar mass rotating black hole is
inserted by hand into the calculation. We consider two cases, the co-rotating
case and counter-rotating case with respect to the black hole rotation.
Although the counter-rotating case may be unrealistic for collapsar, we perform
as a maximally dragging case of magnetic field. The simulation results show the
formation of a disk-like structure and the generation of a jet-like outflow
near the central black hole. The jet-like outflow propagates outwardly with the
twisted magnetic field and becomes collimated. We have found that the jets are
generated and accelerated mainly by the magnetic field. The total jet velocity
in the rotating black hole case is comparable to that of the non-rotating black
hole case (Mizuno et al. 2004), 0.3c. When the rotation of the black hole is
faster, the magnetic field is twisted strongly owing to the frame-dragging
effect. The magnetic energy stored by the twisting magnetic field is converted
to kinetic energy of the jet directly rather than propagating as an Alfven
wave. Thus, as the rotation of the black hole becomes faster, the poloidal
velocity of the jet becomes faster. In the rapidly rotating black hole case the
jet-like outflow can be produced by the frame dragging effect only through the
twisting of magnetic field even if there is no stellar rotation.

be divided into three types according to the strength of normal viscosity. Type
I solution corresponds to large viscosity parameter $\alpha \ga 0.1$, which is
purely advection-dominated and with no convection, and has been extensively
studied in the literature. Type II solution is for moderate $\alpha \sim 0.01$,
which has a three-zone structure. The inner zone is advection-dominated, the
middle zone is convection-dominated and ranges from a few tens to a few
thousands of gravitational radii, and the outer zone is convectively stable and
matches outward a Keplerian disc. The net energy flux throughout the flow is
inward as in type I solution. Type III solution which is for small $\alpha \la
0.001$ consists of two zones as Abramowicz et al. suggested previously: an
inner advection-dominated zone and an outer convection-dominated zone,
separated at a radius of a few tens of gravitational radii. This type of
solution has an outward net energy flux. In both type II and III solutions the
radial density profile is between the 1/2 law of self-similar
convection-dominated accretion flow model and the 3/2 law of self-similar
advection-dominated accretion flow model, and the efficiency of energy release
is found to be extremely low. Our results are in good agreement with those of
recent numerical simulations.

variability can be interpreted in terms of two components: longer-term

chromatism inferring that longer-term flux changes imply moving along a $\sim
0.1$ bluer-when-brighter slope in the $B-R$ versus $R$ plane; a steeper slope
of $\sim 0.4$ would distinguish the shorter-term variations. This means that,
when considering the long-term trend, the $B$-band flux level is related to the
$R$-band one according to a power law of index $\sim 1.1$. Doppler factor
variations on a ""convex"" spectrum could be the mechanism accounting for both
the long-term variations and their slight chromatism.

also predicts synchrotron emission at the level of a few to 10 $\mu$Jy, peaking
at $\nu \sim 2-5$ GHz with possible orbital modulation. We use simplified
semi-analytic models and particle-in-cell simulations to elucidate the
structure of the B magnetosphere, showing that B's magnetic field is confined
to within a radius less than 50,000 km from B,on the side facing A. We estimate
a ``propellor'' spindown torque on B, which is the dominant torque on this
star, which yields a polar dipole field $\sim 7 \times 10^{11}$ Gauss (magnetic
moment $\mu_B \sim 3.5 \times 10^{29}$ cgs). The model can explain the known
eclipses only if the A wind's density is at least 4 orders of magnitude greater
than is expected from popular pair creation models, and discuss the
implications of this result for our general understanding of pulsar physics.

detections of thick disk stellar light in external galaxies have been
originally made for early-type, edge-on galaxies but detailed 2D thick/thin
disk decompositions have been reported for only a scant handful of mostly
late-type disk galaxies. We present in this paper for the first time explicit
3D thick/thin disk decompositions characterising the presence and properties
(eg scalelength and scaleheight) for a sample of eight lenticular galaxies by
fitting 3D disk models to the data. For six out of the eight galaxies we were
able to derive a consistent thin/thick disk model. The mean scaleheight of the
thick disk is 3.6 times larger than that of the thin disk. The scalelength of
the thick disk is about twice, and its central luminosity density between 3-10%
of, the thin disk value. Both thin and thick disk are truncated at similar
radii. This implies that thick disks extend over fewer scalelengths than thin
disks, and turning a thin disk into a thick one requires therefore vertical but
little radial heating. All these structural parameters are similar to thick
disk parameters for later Hubble-type galaxies previously studied. We discuss
our data in respect to present models for the origin of thick disks, either as
pre- or post-thin-disk structures, providing new observational constraints.

quasiparticles are not analytic near the Fermi surface. Prompted by this
observation, we divide Fermi liquids into two categories: regular Fermi liquids
and singular Fermi Liquids. The difference between regular Fermi liquids,
singular Fermi liquids, and non-Fermi liquids fixed points is explained using
properties of the many-body S-matrix for impurity quasiparticle scattering.
Using the Bethe-Ansatz and numerical RG, we show that whereas the ordinary
Kondo Model is a regular Fermi liquid the underscreened Kondo model is a a
singular Fermi liquid. This results in a breakdown of Nozieres' Fermi liquid
picture for the underscreened and explains the singular thermodynamic behavior
noticed in Bethe Ansatz and large-N calculations. Furthermore, we show that
conventional regular Fermi liquid behavior is re-established in an external
magnetic field H, but with a density of states which diverges as 1/H. Possible
connections with the field-tuned quantum criticality recently observed in heavy
electron materials are also discussed.

dependence of the ground state on the electron-phonon (el-ph) and
electron-electron (el-el) coupling strengths, the screening length, electron
bandwidth, phonon frequency, doping, and type of phonon. Unlike the case in
Fermi liquids, in 1D the el-ph coupling is strongly renormalized, often to
stronger values. Even when the bare phonon-induced attraction is weak compared
to the bare el-el repulsion, a small amount of retardation can cause the
renormalized el-ph interaction to dominate the problem. We find cases in which
a repulsive el-el interaction enhances the superconducting susceptibility in
the presence of a retarded el-ph interaction. The spin gap and superconducting
susceptibility are found to be strongly dependent on the deviation from
half-filling (doping). In some cases, the superconducting susceptibility varies
nonmonotonically with doping and exhibits a maximum at a particular doping. For
a quasi-1D array of weakly coupled, fluctuating 1D chains, the superconducting

the presence of holes is crucial for establishing ferromagnetism. For both
systems, the introduction of $U$ increases delocalization of the holes and,
simultaneously, decreases the p-d interaction. Since these two trends exert
opposite influences on the Mn-Mn exchange interaction the character of the
variation of the Curie temperature (T$_C$) cannot be predicted without direct
calculation. We show that the variation of T$_C$ is different for two systems.
For low Mn concentrations we obtain the tendency to increasing T$_C$ in the
case of (GaMn)N whereas an opposite tendency to decreasing T$_C$ is obtained
for (GaMn)As. We reveal the origin of this difference by inspecting the
properties of the densities of states and holes for both systems. The main body
of calculations is performed within a supercell approach. The Curie
temperatures calculated within the coherent potential approximation to atomic
disorder are reported for comparison. Both approaches give similar qualitative
behavior. The results of calculations are related to the experimental data.

model that can accurately simulate microstructural pattern formation for
low-speed directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy. This advance
with respect to previous phase-field models is achieved by the addition of a
phenomenological ""antitrapping"" solute current in the mass conservation
relation [A. Karma, Phys. Rev. Lett 87, 115701 (2001)]. This antitrapping
current counterbalances the physical, albeit artificially large, solute
trapping effect generated when a mesoscopic interface thickness is used to
simulate the interface evolution on experimental length and time scales.
Furthermore, it provides additional freedom in the model to suppress other
spurious effects that scale with this thickness when the diffusivity is unequal
in solid and liquid [R. F. Almgren, SIAM J. Appl. Math 59, 2086 (1999)], which
include surface diffusion and a curvature correction to the Stefan condition.
This freedom can also be exploited to make the kinetic undercooling of the
interface arbitrarily small even for mesoscopic values of both the interface
thickness and the phase-field relaxation time, as for the solidification of
pure melts [A. Karma and W.-J. Rappel, Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 (1996)]. The
performance of the model is demonstrated by calculating accurately for the
first time within a phase-field approach the Mullins-Sekerka stability spectrum
of a planar interface and nonlinear cellular shapes for realistic alloy
parameters and growth conditions.

power-law expression with a quadratic as the exponential term is proposed for
the effective Young's moduli of the systems as a function of the solid volume
fraction. The data is divided into three regions with respect to the volume
fraction; low, intermediate and high concentrations. The parameters of the
proposed power-law expression in each region are later represented as a
function of the structural parameters, unit-cell dimensions. The presented
expression can be used to predict structure/property relationship in materials
with similar cellular structures. It is observed that the structures with
volume fractions of solid higher than 0.15 exhibit the importance of the
cell-wall thickness contribution in the elastic properties. The cell-wall
thickness is the most significant factor to predict the effective Young's
modulus of regular cellular structures at high volume fractions of solid. At
lower concentrations of solid, eye-like structure yields lower Young's modulus

second order phase transition belonging to the universality class of dynamic
isotropic percolation lies between endemic or pandemic behavior of the process.
We generalize the general epidemic process by introducing a fourth kind of
individuals, viz. individuals which are weakened by the process but not yet
infected. This sensibilization gives rise to a mechanism that introduces a
global instability in the spreading of the process and therefore opens the
possibility of a discontinuous transition in addition to the usual continuous
percolation transition. The tricritical point separating the lines of first and
second order transitions constitutes a new universality class, namely the
universality class of tricritical dynamic isotropic percolation. Using
renormalized field theory we work out a detailed scaling description of this
universality class. We calculate the scaling exponents in an
$\epsilon$-expansion below the upper critical dimension $d_{c}=5$ for various
observables describing tricritical percolation clusters and their spreading
properties. In a remarkable contrast to the usual percolation transition, the
exponents $\beta$ and ${\beta}^{\prime}$ governing the two order parameters,
viz. the mean density and the percolation probability, turn out to be different
at the tricritical point. In addition to the scaling exponents we calculate for
all our static and dynamic observables logarithmic corrections to the
mean-field scaling behavior at $d_c=5$.

the classical Matched Filter Technique. After a direct comparison of the
performances of ALE filters with the Wiener-Komolgoroff optimum filters
(matched filters), necessary to discuss their performance and to evaluate the
statistical limitation in their use as triggers, we performed a series of
tests, demonstrating that these filters are quite promising both for the
relatively small computational power needed and for the robustness of the
algorithms used. The performed tests have shown a weak point of ALE filters,
that we fixed by introducing a further strategy, based on a dynamic bank of ALE
filters, running simultaneously, but started after fixed delay times. The
results of this global trigger strategy seems to be very promising, and can be
already used in the present interferometers, since it has the great advantage

experimental situations: First, the light source and the detector are at rest
relative to the matter generating the gravitational field. In this case we find
an expression that is formally equivalent to the familiar nonrelativistic
Sagnac time delay. Second, the light source and the detector are rotating
relative to the matter. Here we show that for a special rotation rate of the
detector the Sagnac time delay vanishes. Finally we propose a formulation of
the Sagnac time delay in terms of invariant physical quantities. We show that
this result is very close to the analogous formula of the Sagnac time delay of
a rotating coordinate system in Minkowski spacetime.

the mass gap to the higher modes. For a wide domain wall, this mass gap is set
by ``Kaluza--Klein modes'' as determined by the width. It is pointed out that

coupled with quantum gravity. Differently from even dimensions, in odd
dimensions it is not always possible to have propagators with fully Lorentz
invariant denominators. The main features of the deformed technique are
illustrated in a set of sample calculations. The regularization is universal,
local, manifestly gauge-invariant and Lorentz invariant in the physical sector
of spacetime. In flat space power-like divergences are set to zero by default.
Infinitely many evanescent operators are automatically dropped.

to just ONE particular class of 5 stack models containing the SM gauge group,
which all have the same chiral spectrum. The further discussion shows that
these models can be understood as exactly the supersymmetric standard model
without any exotic chiral symmetric/antisymmetric matter. The superpartner of
the Higgs finds a natural explanation and the hypercharge remains massless.
However, the non-chiral spectrum within the model class is very different and
does not in all cases allow for a N=2 low energy field theoretical
understanding of the necessary breaking U(1)xU(1)->U(1) along the Higgs branch,
which is needed in order to get the standard Yukawa couplings. Also the
left-right symmetric models belong to exactly one class of chiral spectra,
where the two kinds of exotic chiral fields can have the interpretation of
forming a composite Higgs. The aesthetical beauty of these models, involving
only non-vanishing intersection numbers of an absolute value three, seems to be
unescapable.

of high Reynolds-number turbulence (and turbulent transport). We present a
detailed description of the new tools that allow effective data analysis and
systematic theoretical studies such as to separate isotropic from anisotropic
aspects of turbulent statistical fluctuations. Employing the invariance of the
equations of fluid mechanics to all rotations, we show how to decompose the
(tensorial) statistical objects in terms of the irreducible representation of
the SO(3) symmetry group. For the case of turbulent advection of passive scalar
or vector fields, this decomposition allows rigorous statements to be made: (i)
the scaling exponents are universal, (ii) the isotropic scaling exponents are
always leading, (iii) the anisotropic scaling exponents form a discrete
spectrum which is strictly increasing as a function of the anisotropic degree.
Next we explain how to apply the SO(3) decomposition to the statistical
Navier-Stokes theory. We show how to extract information about the scaling
behavior in the isotropic sector. Doing so furnishes a systematic way to assess
the universality of the scaling exponents in this sector, clarifying the
anisotropic origin of the many measurements that claimed the opposite. A
systematic analysis of Direct Numerical Simulations and of experiments provides
a strong support to the proposition that also for the non-linear problem there
exists foliation of the statistical theory into sectors of the symmetry group.
The exponents appear universal in each sector, and again strictly increasing as
a function of the anisotropic degreee.

Parton Distribution (GPD) $H_q^3$ of the $^3He$ nucleus is presented. In
Impulse Approximation, $H_q^3$ is obtained as a convolution between the GPD of
the internal nucleon and the non-diagonal spectral function, describing
properly Fermi motion and binding effects. The proposed scheme is valid at low
values of $\Delta^2$, the momentum transfer to the target, the most relevant
kinematical region for the coherent channel of hard exclusive processes. The
obtained formula has the correct forward limit, corresponding to the standard
deep inelastic nuclear parton distributions, and first moment, giving the
charge form factor of $^3He$. Nuclear effects, evaluated by a modern realistic
potential, are found to be larger than in the forward case. In particular, they
increase with increasing the momentum transfer when the asymmetry of the
process is kept fixed, and they increase with the asymmetry at fixed momentum
transfer. Another relevant feature of the obtained results is that the nuclear
GPD cannot be factorized into a $\Delta^2$-dependent and a
$\Delta^2$-independent term, as suggested in prescriptions proposed for finite
nuclei. The size of nuclear effects reaches 8 % even in the most important part
of the kinematical range under scrutiny. The relevance of the obtained results
to study the feasibility of experiments is addressed.

to the Penrose mechanism: to extract energy from a rotating black hole, the
Penrose mechanism (since first proposed by Roger Penrose in 1969) had been
attempted by scientists over the world for nearly two decades, with little
success, although making some progress. In the Penrose analysis of Williams
(1991, 1995) details of the behavior of efficient Penrose relativistic
scattering processes in the ergosphere are described. The reason a solution
eluded other scientists before me is that there was very little known about
orbits inside the ergosphere, where space and time are no longer separable, as
measured by an observer at infinity (i.e., far away from the Kerr black hole).

failed. Also, I will mention some well known scientists in the astrophysics

into another one by local operations and classical communications. Then in
general a certain amount of entanglement contained in the initial state will
decrease in the process of transformation. However, an interesting phenomenon
called partial entanglement recovery shows that it is possible to recover some
amount of entanglement by adding another entangled state and transforming the
two entangled states collectively.
  In this paper we are mainly concerned with the feasibility of partial
entanglement recovery. The basic problem we address is whether a given state is
useful in recovering entanglement lost in a specified transformation. In the
case where the source and target states of the original transformation satisfy
the strict majorization relation, a necessary and sufficient condition for
partial entanglement recovery is obtained. For the general case we give two
sufficient conditions. We also give an efficient algorithm for the feasibility
of partial entanglement recovery in polynomial time.
  As applications, we establish some interesting connections between partial
entanglement recovery and the generation of maximally entangled states, quantum
catalysis, mutual catalysis, and multiple-copy entanglement transformation.
