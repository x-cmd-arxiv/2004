optical/IR wavelengths. We use their inferred brightness to place general
constraints on any model for this emission within the magnetar framework. We
find that neutron-star surface emission cannot account for the observations and
that the emission must be magnetospheric in origin. We propose a model for the
optical/IR emission in which a distribution of energetic electrons in the
neutron-star magnetosphere emits synchrotron radiation. This model can
naturally reproduce the observed brightness and the rising spectra of AXPs as
well as the observed pulsations at the stellar spin frequency and the

fits of known exoplanets in the 2/1 mean-motion resonance and the expected
orbital configuration due to migration. It is found that, as long as the
orbital decay was sufficiently slow to be approximated by an adiabatic process,
all captured planets should be in apsidal corotations. In other words, they
should show a simultaneous libration of both the resonant angle and the
difference in longitudes of pericenter.
  We present a complete set of corotational solutions for the 2/1
commensurability, including previously known solutions and new results.
Comparisons with observed exoplanets show that current orbital fits of three
known planetary systems in this resonance are either consistent with apsidal
corotations (GJ876 and HD82943) or correspond to bodies with uncertain orbits
(HD160691).
  Finally, we discuss the applicability of these results as a test for the
planetary migration hypothesis itself. If all future systems in this
commensurability are found to be consistent with corotational solutions, then
resonance capture of these bodies through planetary migration is a working
hypothesis. Conversely, If any planetary pair is found in a different
configuration, then either migration did not occur for those bodies, or it took
a different form than currently believed.

function and its observed dependencies on luminosity and color.The luminosity
dependence of the correlation function is primarily determined by the changing
relative contribution of central and satellite galaxies at different
luminosities. The color dependence of the GM correlations reflects the
difference in the typical environments of blue and red galaxies. We also find
agreement between the predicted and observed cross-bias, b_x=b/r,at all probed
scales.The GM correlation coefficient, r, is close to unity on scales >1/h
Mpc.The cross bias is thus expected to measure the actual bias of galaxy
clustering on these scales.The aperture mass-to-light ratio is independent of
galaxy color.The aperture mass scales approximately linearly with luminosity at
L_r>10^{10}h^{-2} Lsun, while at lower luminosities the scaling is shallower:
L_r^{0.5}. We show that most of the luminous galaxies (M_r<-21) are near the
centers of their halos and their GM correlation function at r<100/h kpc can
therefore be interpreted as the average dark matter density profile of these
galaxies. We find that for galaxies in a given narrow luminosity range, there
is a broad and possibly non-gaussian distribution of halo virial masses.

is detected in the central supergiant HII region, as well as the barely seen

seen as broad, low-contrast components in the Ha, Hb and strong [OIII] lines.
While the extinction of the narrow emission lines from the supergiant HII

that the part of current starburst is highly obscured by dust. Abundance ratios
X/O for X=Ne, Ar, S, Fe and Cl in the supergiant HII region are in good
agreement with the mean values of other BCGs. Nitrogen, however, is
overabundant by a factor of ~6. This implies an unusually efficient N

either counter-rotation, or strong outflow/supershell. The overall BCG
morphology is highly disturbed. With a ""double-nucleus"" structure, disturbed

pulsed emission by their large fluxes, rarity, approximately power-law
distribution of fluxes and, typically, occurrence in restricted phase windows.
Here existing observations of flux distributions are manipulated into a common
format and interpreted in terms of theories for wave growth in inhomogeneous
media, with the aim of constraining the emission mechanism and source physics
for giant pulses and micropulses. Giant micropulses near 2 GHz (PSRs B8033-45
and B1706-44) and 0.4 GHz (PSR B0950+08) have indices $\alpha = 6.5 \pm 0.7$
for the probability distribution $P(E)$ of the electric field $E$, with $P(E)
\propto E^{-\alpha}$. Giant pulses (PSRs B0531+24, B1937+214, and B1821-24)
have $\alpha$ ranging from $4.6 \pm 0.2$ to $9 \pm 2$, possibly increasing with
frequency. These are similar enough to regard giant micropulses and pulses as a
single phenomenon with a common physical explanation. The power-law functional
form and values of $\alpha$ observed are consistent with predictions for
nonlinear wave collapse, but inconsistent with known self-organized critical
systems, nonlinear decay processes, and elementary burst theory. While
relativistic beaming may be important, its statistics are yet to be predicted
theoretically and collapse is currently the favored interpretation. Other
possibilities remain, including stochastic growth theory (consistent with
normal pulse emission) and, less plausibly, refractive lensing. Unresolved
issues remain for all four interpretations and suggestions for further work are
given. The differences between normal and giant pulse emission suggest they
have distinct source regions and emission processes.

and their dynamical state (as indicated by the existence of significant
substructres). (2) The Cluster Dynamics -Cluster Clustering Connection, by
which dynamically young clusters are more clustered than the overall cluster
population. (3) The Cluster- Supercluster Alignment Connection, by which
clusters of galaxies show a statistical significant tendency to be aligned with

three were identified with X-ray Novas - black hole candidates: 152 h

the orbital periodicity is revealed in the hard emission of the X-ray transient

orbital but its origin is not connected with eclipses of the compact companion
of a binary system. Periodic processes in soft and hard X-rays can be
associated with orbital motion of binary system companions, but the physical
mechanisms and the regions of generation of soft and hard X-rays can be quite

the angles under which we view the LMC disk; its in-plane and vertical
structure; the LMC self-lensing contribution to the total microlensing optical
depth; the LMC orbit around the Milky Way; and the origin and interpretation of
the Magellanic Stream. Our understanding of these topics is evolving rapidly,
in particular due to the many large photometric and kinematic datasets that
have become available in the last few years. It has now been established that:
the LMC is considerably elongated in its disk plane; the LMC disk is thicker
than previously believed; the LMC disk may have warps and twists; the LMC may
have a pressure-supported halo; the inner regions of the LMC show unexpected
complexities in their vertical structure; and precession and nutation of the
LMC disk plane contribute measurably to the observed line-of-sight velocity
field. However, many open questions remain and more work is needed before we
can expect to converge on a fully coherent structural, dynamical and
evolutionary picture that explains all observed features of the LMC.

polarization factors are well defined, the voltage-driven torque on each moment

White in 1992 as a method for accurately describing the properties of
one-dimensional quantum lattices. The method, as originally introduced, was
based on the iterative inclusion of sites on a real-space lattice. Based on its
enormous success in that domain, it was subsequently proposed that the DMRG
could be modified for use on finite Fermi systems, through the replacement of
real-space lattice sites by an appropriately ordered set of single-particle
levels. Since then, there has been an enormous amount of work on the subject,
ranging from efforts to clarify the optimal means of implementing the algorithm
to extensive applications in a variety of fields. In this article, we review
these recent developments. Following a description of the real-space DMRG
method, we discuss the key steps that were undertaken to modify it for use on
finite Fermi systems and then describe its applications to Quantum Chemistry,
ultrasmall superconducting grains, finite nuclei and two-dimensional electron
systems. We also describe a recent development which permits symmetries to be
taken into account consistently throughout the DMRG algorithm. We close with an
outlook for future applications of the method.

  Logic Programming (TPLP)",,,,"cs.PL",,"  The logic programming paradigm provides the basis for a new intensional view
of higher-order notions. This view is realized primarily by employing the terms
of a typed lambda calculus as representational devices and by using a richer
form of unification for probing their structures. These additions have
important meta-programming applications but they also pose non-trivial
implementation problems. One issue concerns the machine representation of
lambda terms suitable to their intended use: an adequate encoding must
facilitate comparison operations over terms in addition to supporting the usual
reduction computation. Another aspect relates to the treatment of a unification
operation that has a branching character and that sometimes calls for the
delaying of the solution of unification problems. A final issue concerns the
execution of goals whose structures become apparent only in the course of
computation. These various problems are exposed in this paper and solutions to
them are described. A satisfactory representation for lambda terms is developed
by exploiting the nameless notation of de Bruijn as well as explicit encodings
of substitutions. Special mechanisms are molded into the structure of
traditional Prolog implementations to support branching in unification and
carrying of unification problems over other computation steps; a premium is
placed in this context on exploiting determinism and on emulating usual
first-order behaviour. An extended compilation model is presented that treats
higher-order unification and also handles dynamically emergent goals. The ideas
described here have been employed in the Teyjus implementation of the Lambda
Prolog language, a fact that is used to obtain a preliminary assessment of
their efficacy.

dynamical systems have flourished since Turing's work. We propose a general
definition of universality that applies to arbitrary discrete time symbolic
dynamical systems. Universality of a system is defined as undecidability of a
model-checking problem. For Turing machines, counter machines and tag systems,
our definition coincides with the classical one. It yields, however, a new
definition for cellular automata and subshifts. Our definition is robust with
respect to initial condition, which is a desirable feature for physical
realizability.
  We derive necessary conditions for undecidability and universality. For
instance, a universal system must have a sensitive point and a proper
subsystem. We conjecture that universal systems have infinite number of
subsystems. We also discuss the thesis according to which computation should
occur at the `edge of chaos' and we exhibit a universal chaotic system.

a natural physical interpretation as the non-relativistic limit of the massive

recurrently in the length of multi-indices, which they called admissible

Admissible sequences and admissible elements for D^{2,2,2} (resp. D^4) form 14

  If under all indecomposable representations of a modular lattice the image of
an element is either zero or the whole representation space, the element is
said to be perfect. Our classification of perfect elements for D^{2,2,2} is
based on the description of admissible elements. The constructed set H^+ of
perfect elements is the union of 64-element distributive lattices H^+(n), and
H^+ is the distributive lattice itself. The lattice of perfect elements B^+

contributions due to PS-PS and PS-PV couplings in the $\pi$-N interaction and

small value, without considering the $NN\pi$ form factor, the difference
between PS-PS and PS-PV couplings are negligible. However, when the $NN\pi$
form factor is included, this difference is greatly enlarged. The resultant
decay widths are sensitive to the form factors. As a conclusion, the
nucleon-pole contribution as a background is important in the $J/\psi\to

of ultracold cesium atoms with a chirped laser pulse and detailed analysis of
the results. In contrast with earlier work, the initial state is represented by
a stationary continuum wavefunction. In the chosen example, it is shown that an
important population transfer is achieved to $\approx 15$ vibrational levels in
the vicinity of the v=98 bound level in the external well of the
$0_g^-(6s+6p_{3/2})$ potential. Such levels lie in the energy range swept by
the instantaneous frequency of the pulse, thus defining a ``photoassociation
window''. Levels outside this window may be significantly excited during the
pulse, but no population remains there after the pulse. Finally, the population
transfer to the last vibrational levels of the ground $a^3\Sigma_u^+$(6s + 6s)
is significant, making stable molecules. The results are interpreted in the
framework of a two state model as an adiabatic inversion mechanism, efficient
only within the photoassociation window. The large value found for the
photoassociation rate suggests promising applications. The present chirp has
been designed in view of creating a vibrational wavepacket in the excited state
which is focussing at the barrier of the double well potential.

(Aeschna juncea) in hovering flight are studied. The method of numerically
solving the Navier-Stokes equations in moving overset grids is used.
  There are two large vertical force peaks in one flapping cycle. One is in the
first half of the cycle, which is mainly due to the hindwings in their
downstroke; the other is in the second half of the cycle, which is mainly due
to the forewings in their downstroke. Hovering with a large stroke plane angle,
the dragonfly uses drag as a major source for its weight supporting force
(approximately 65% of the total vertical force is contributed by the drag and
35% by the lift of the wings). The vertical force coefficient of a wing is
twice as large as the quasi-steady value. The interaction between the fore- and
hindwings is not very strong and is detrimental to the vertical force
generation. Compared with the case of a single wing in the same motion, the
interaction effect reduces the vertical forces on the fore- and hindwings by
14% and 16% of that of the corresponding single wing, respectively. The large
vertical force is due to the unsteady flow effects. The mechanism of the
unsteady force is that in each downstroke of the hindwing or the forewing, a
new vortex ring containing downward momentum is generated, giving an upward
force. The body-mass-specific power is 37 W kg-1, which is mainly contributed
by the aerodynamic power.

as a corpuscular object. But according to wave-particle duality, we know a free
particle can behave like a wave. Is there a wave property that corresponds to
the mass of a particle? This is an interesting question that has not been
extensively explored before. We suggest that this problem can be approached by
treating the mass on the same footing as energy and momentum. Here we propose
that, all particles are excitation waves of the vacuum and different particles
are represented by different excitation modes. Based on such a model, we found
that mass is not an intrinsic property of the particle. Instead, mass is
basically a measure of the particle energy. The relations between energy and
mass can be directly derived based on the wave properties of the particle. This
work explains why some particles are ""wave-like"" while others are
""particle-like"". Furthermore, this work has several interesting implications.
It directly explains why photons can interact with a gravitational field. It
also suggests a possible origin of dark matter; they are thought to be composed
of excitation waves that fail to interact with each other. From this model, one
can easily see why our universe has more dark matters than visible matters.

the possibility of atoms tunneling along two different paths. Such interactions
can be employed to simulate particular one or two dimensional physical systems
with ground states that possess a rich structure and undergo a variety of
quantum phase transitions. In addition, tunneling can be activated by employing
Raman transitions, thus creating an effective Hamiltonian that does not
preserve the number of atoms of each species. In the presence of external
electromagnetic fields, resulting in complex tunneling couplings, we obtain
effective Hamiltonians that break chiral symmetry. The ground states of these
Hamiltonians can be used for the physical implementation of geometrical or
topological objects.

two ways to approach this question. The first is dynamic: the coupling of a
large object to its environment cause any entanglement to decrease
considerably. The second approach, which is discussed in this paper, puts the
stress on the difficulty to observe a large scale entanglement. As the number
of particles n grows we need an ever more precise knowledge of the state, and
an ever more carefully designed experiment, in order to recognize entanglement.
To develop this point we consider a family of observables, called witnesses,
which are designed to detect entanglement. A witness W distinguishes all the
separable (unentangled) states from some entangled states. If we normalize the
witness W to satisfy |tr(W\rho)| \leq 1 for all separable states \rho, then the
efficiency of W depends on the size of its maximal eigenvalue in absolute
value; that is, its operator norm ||W||. It is known that there are witnesses
on the space of n qbits for which ||W|| is exponential in n. However, we
conjecture that for a large majority of n-qbit witnesses ||W|| \leq O(\sqrt{n
logn}). Thus, in a non ideal measurement, which includes errors, the largest
eigenvalue of a typical witness lies below the threshold of detection. We prove
this conjecture for the family of extremal witnesses introduced by Werner and
Wolf (Phys. Rev. A 64, 032112 (2001)).

pure states, the negativity is the same as the concurrence. However, we
demonstrate analytically on simple examples of various mixtures of Bell and
separable states that the entanglement measures can impose different orderings
on the states. We show which states, in general, give the maximally different
predictions, (i) when one of the states has the concurrence greater but the
negativity smaller than those for the other state, and (ii) when the states are
