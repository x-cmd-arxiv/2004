  color figures, 7 b/w figures","Astrophys.J.611:703-724,2004","10.1086/422308",,"astro-ph",,"  We recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z>2 with red
rest-frame optical colors. These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently
selected by the simple observed color criterion J-K>2.3. In this paper we
present NIR spectroscopy with Keck/NIRSPEC of six DRGs at 2.4<z<3.2. We detect
continuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. Equivalent
widths of H alpha are 20-30 Ang, smaller than measured for LBGs and nearby
LIRGs, and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. The modest equivalent widths
imply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate, or that
they are very dusty. Fitting both the photometry and the H alpha lines, we find
continuum extinction A_V=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 Gyr, star formation rates 200-400
solar masses/yr, and stellar masses 1-5x10^11 solar masses for models with
constant star formation rates. From [NII]/H alpha ratios we infer that the
metallicities are high, 1-1.5 x Solar. For four galaxies we can determine line
widths from the optical emission lines. The widths are high, ranging from
130-240 km/s, and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs we find significant
correlations between linewidth and restframe U-V color, and between linewidth
and stellar mass. The latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the
``baryonic Tully-Fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. The median dynamical
mass is ~2x10^11 solar masses, supporting the high stellar masses inferred from
the photometry. We find that the median M/L_V ~ 0.8, a factor of ~5 higher than
measured for LBGs. We infer from our small sample that DRGs are dustier, more
metal rich, more massive, and have higher ages than z=3 LBGs of the same
rest-frame V-band luminosity. Their high M/L ratios imply that they contribute
significantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5. [ABRIDGED]

brightest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the central regions of M32.
Based on a comparison with brightnesses obtained from the K-band data discussed
by Davidge et al. (2000, ApJ, 545, L89), it is concluded that (1) at least 60%
of bright AGB stars near the center of M32 are photometrically variable, and
(2) the amplitudes of the light variations are similar to those of long period
variables in the Galactic bulge. We do not find evidence for a population of
large amplitude variables, like those detected by IRAS in the Galactic bulge.
The technique discussed here may prove useful for conducting an initial
reconnaisance of photometric variability among AGB stars in spheroids in the
Virgo cluster and beyond, where the required long exposure times may restrict
observations to only a few epochs.

strong, extended sub-mm flux at 850 microns. The most striking feature in the
map is an elongated region of bright sub-mm emission, with a flux density of
>10 mJy over several beam-sizes. This region is apparently coincident with a
previously known optical arc (which turns out to be a strongly lensed Lyman
Break Galaxy at z=2.911), as well as with a newly identified multiply-imaged
ERO (Extremely Red Object) pair predicted to be at a similar, if not identical
redshift. By combing a detailed lensing model with deep images from HST,
Chandra, CFHT, JCMT, and spectra from the VLT, we conclude that both the
strongly lensed optical arc and ERO systems have properties consistent with
known sub-mm emitters. Using a simple model for the two sources, we estimate
that the multiply-lensed EROs contribute the majority of the flux in the SCUBA
lensed arc. Correcting for the lensing amplification, we estimate that the
inherent 850 micron fluxes for both objects are ~0.4 mJy. If the LBG and ERO
pair are truly at the same redshift, then they are separated by only ~10 kpc in
the source plane, and hence constitute an interacting system at z~2.9. Higher
angular resolution observations in sub-mm/mm will permit us to more accurately
separate the contribution from each candidate, and better understand the nature
of this system.

luminous cluster of galaxies RDCS J1252.9-2927. Photometric redshifts, derived
from deep multi-wavelength BVRIzJKs data, and calibrated using a large subset
of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, are used to separate the cluster
galaxy population from the foreground and background field galaxy population.
This allows for a simultaneous determination of the characteristic magnitude
Ks* and faint end slope alpha of the LF without having to make an uncertain
statistical background subtraction. The shape of the bright end of the derived
LF is similar to that measured at similar restframe wavelengths (in the z-band)
in local clusters, but the characteristic magnitude is brighter by Delta
Mz*=-1.40(+0.49/-0.58) magnitudes, suggesting that the massive cluster
ellipticals that dominate the bright end of the LF were already in place at
z=1.237. The derived alpha is shallower (at the 2.2 sigma level) than the value
measured in the z-band in clusters in the local universe, suggesting that RDCS
J1252.9-2927 contains a relatively smaller fraction of low mass galaxies than
clusters in the local universe. The results presented in this paper are a
challenge for semi analytical hierarchical models of galaxy formation which
predict the characteristic magnitude to grow fainter and the faint end slope to
steepen with redshift as the massive galaxies break up into their progenitors.
The observed evolution is consistent with a scenario in which clusters are
composed of a population of massive galaxies which formed at high redshift
(z>>1) and subsequently evolved passively, and a population of lower mass
galaxies which are gradually accreted from the field, primarily at lower
redshift (z<1). (Abridged)

for investigating and displaying configuration dependence. The novel
parametrization renders the relation between bi-spectrum and three-point
correlation function especially transparent as a set of two-dimensional Hankel
transforms. It is expected on theoretical grounds, that three-point statistics
can be described accurately with only a few multipoles. In particular, we show
that in the weakly non-linear regime, the multipoles of the reduced bispectrum,
$Q_l$, are significant only up to quadrupole. Moreover, the non-linear bias in
the weakly non-linear regime only affects the monopole order of these
statistics. As a consequence, a simple, novel set of estimators can be
constructed to constrain galaxy bias. In addition, the quadrupole to dipole
ratio is independent of the bias, thus it becomes a novel diagnostic of the
underlying theoretical assumptions: weakly non-linear gravity and perturbative
local bias. To illustrate the use of our approach, we present predictions based
on both power law, and CDM models. We show that the presently favoured
SDSS-WMAP concordance model displays strong ``baryon bumps'' in the $Q_l$'s.
Finally, we sketch out three practical techniques estimate these novel
quantities: they amount to new, and for the first time edge corrected,
estimators for the bispectrum.

of view of symmetries. We show that the redshift space two-point correlation
function can be expanded into tripolar spherical harmonics of zero total
angular momentum $S_{l_1 l_2 l_3}(\hat x_1, \hat x_2, \hat x)$. The
coefficients of the expansion $B_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$ are analogous to the $C_l$'s of
the angular power spectrum, and express the anisotropy of the redshift space
correlation function. Moreover, only a handful of $B_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$ are
non-zero: the resulting formulae reveal a hidden simplicity comparable to
distant observer limit. The $B_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$ depend on spherical Bessel
moments of the power spectrum and $f = \Omega^{0.6}/b$. In the plane parallel
limit, the results of \cite{Kaiser1987} and \cite{Hamilton1993} are recovered.
The general formalism is used to derive useful new expressions. We present a
particularly simple trigonometric polynomial expansion, which is arguably the
most compact expression of wide angle redshift distortions. These formulae are
suitable to inversion due to the orthogonality of the basis functions. An
alternative Legendre polynomial expansion was obtained as well. This can be
shown to be equivalent to the results of \cite{SzalayEtal1998}. The simplicity
of the underlying theory will admit similar calculations for higher order
statistics as well.

character of de-Broglie--Bohm theory, the quantum potential, as the conformal
degree of freedom of the space--time metric. In this way, gravity should give
the causal structure of the space--time, while quantum phenomena determines the
scale. Some toy models in terms of tensor and scalar--tensor theories will be
presented. Then a few essential physical aspects of the idea including the
effect on the black holes, the initial Big--Bang singularity and non locality
are investigated. We shall formulate a quantum equivalence principle according
to which gravitational effects can be removed by going to a freely falling
frame while quantum effects can be eliminated by choosing an appropriate scale.
And we shall see that the best framework for both quantum and gravity is Weyl
geometry. Then we shall show how one can get the de-Broglie--Bohm quantum
theory out of a Weyl covariant theory. Extension to the case of many particle

energy is electromagnetic. For natural weak-scale parameters, these decays have
been shown to satisfy bounds from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic
microwave background. However, sleptons and sneutrinos may also decay to
three-body final states, producing hadronic energy, which is subject to even
more stringent nucleosynthesis bounds. We determine the three-body branching
fractions and the resulting hadronic energy release. We find that superWIMP
gravitino dark matter is viable and determine the gravitino and
slepton/sneutrino masses preferred by this solution to the dark matter problem.

between the localization picture of the B-model with a noncompact target space

shuffle as a model for the cryptographic system known as ``RC4'' and proved an
upper bound of O(n log n) for the mixing time. We prove a matching lower bound,
thus establishing that the mixing time is indeed of order $\Theta(n \log n)$.
We also prove an upper bound of O(n log n) for the mixing time of any

complex-valued test function which typically takes very different values for
permutations arising from the cyclic-to-random-shuffle and for uniform random
permutations; we expect that this test function may be useful in future

numerical simulations of statistically stationary isotropic box turbulence that
is slightly compressible. The Taylor microscale Reynolds number Re_lambda range
is 20 < Re_lambda < 220 and the statistical stationarity is achieved with a
random phase forcing method. The strong Re_lambda dependence of C_epsilon
abates when Re_lambda approx. 100 after which C_epsilon slowly approaches
approx 0.5 a value slightly different to previously reported simulations but in
good agreement with experimental results. If C_epsilon is estimated at a
specific time step from the time series of the quantities involved it is
necessary to account for the time lag between energy injection and energy
dissipation. Also, the resulting value can differ from the ensemble averaged
value by up to +-30%. This may explain the spread in results from previously
published estimates of C_epsilon.

  conservative consistency of false discovery rates"": Does a large number of
  tests obviate confidence intervals of the FDR?",,,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.CB",,"  A previously proved theorem gives sufficient conditions for an estimator of
the false discovery rate (FDR) to conservatively converge to the FDR with
probability 1 as the number of hypothesis tests increases, even for small
sample sizes. It does not follow that several thousand tests ensure that the
estimator has moderate variance under those conditions. In fact, they can hold
even if the test statistics have long-range correlations, which yield
unacceptably wide confidence intervals, as observed in genomic data when there
are 8 or 16 individuals (microarrays) per group. Thus, informative FDR
estimation will include some measure of its reliability.

microarrays is gaining popularity as methods improve and as more data become
available. The reliability of such networks could be judged by the probability
that a connection between genes is spurious, resulting from chance fluctuations
rather than from a true biological relationship. Results: Unlike the false
discovery rate and positive false discovery rate, the decisive false discovery
rate (dFDR) is exactly equal to a conditional probability without assuming
independence or the randomness of hypothesis truth values. This property is
useful not only in the common application to the detection of differential gene
expression, but also in determining the probability of a spurious connection in
a reconstructed gene network. Estimators of the dFDR can estimate each of three
probabilities: 1. The probability that two genes that appear to be associated
with each other lack such association. 2. The probability that a time ordering
observed for two associated genes is misleading. 3. The probability that a time
ordering observed for two genes is misleading, either because they are not
associated or because they are associated without a lag in time. The first
probability applies to both static and dynamic gene networks, and the other two
only apply to dynamic gene networks. Availability: Cross-platform software for
network reconstruction, probability estimation, and plotting is free from

our derivations is a variant of teleportation introduced by Zhou, Leung, and

of the tetrahedral measurement for a qubit. The question of the minimal number
