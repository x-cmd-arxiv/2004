multifluid MHD code that models the plasma as a system of interacting fluids:
neutral particles, ions, electrons, and various ``dust fluids'' comprised of
grains with different sizes and charges. Our simulations include grain inertia
and grain charge fluctuations but to highlight the essential physics we assume
adiabatic flow, single-size grains, and neglect the effects of chemistry. We
show that the existence of a phase speed v_phi does not necessarily mean that C
shocks will form for all shock speeds v_s less than v_phi. When the grains are
weakly coupled to the field, steady, adiabatic shocks resemble shocks with no
dust: the transition to J type flow occurs at v_crit = 2.76 v_nA, where v_nA is
the neutral Alfven speed, and steady shocks with v_s > 2.76 v_nA are J shocks
with magnetic precursors in the ion-electron fluid. When the grains are
strongly coupled to the field, v_crit = min(2.76 v_nA, v_gms). Shocks with
v_crit < v_s < v_gms have magnetic precursors in the ion-electron-dust fluid.
Shocks with v_s > v_gms have no magnetic precursor in any fluid. We present
time-dependent calculations to study the formation of steady multifluid shocks.

destruction. In the end, a central mass concentration is build, which also
contributes to this destruction. While gas can be stalled at ILR for a while,
secondary bars then take over the fueling. In a galaxy life-time, several bar

terrestrial planets may form from a second generation of planetesimals. In each

accreted material first reaches the WD's surface at its equator. This matter
slows its orbit as it comes into co-rotation with the WD, dissipating kinetic
energy into thermal energy and creating a hot band of freshly accreted material
around the equator. Radiating in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays, this
material moves toward the pole as new material piles behind it, eventually
becoming part of the WD once it has a temperature and rotational velocity
comparable with the surface. We present a set of solutions which describe the
properties of this ``spreading layer'' in the steady state limit based on the
conservation equations derived by Inogamov & Sunyaev (1999) for accreting
neutron stars. Our analysis and subsequent solutions show that the case of WDs
is qualitatively different. We investigate example solutions of the spreading
layer for a WD of mass $M=0.6M_\odot$ and radius $R=9\times10^{8}{\rm cm}$.
These solutions show that the spreading layer typically extends to an angle of
$\theta_{\rm SL}\approx0.01-0.1$ (with respect to the equator), depending on
accretion rate and the magnitude of the viscosity. At low accretion rates,
$\dot{M}\lesssim10^{18}{\rm g s}^{-1}$, the amount of spreading is negligible
and most of the dissipated energy is radiated back into the accretion disk.
When the accretion rate is high, such as in dwarf novae, symbiotic binaries,
and supersoft sources, the material may spread to latitudes high enough to be
directly visible above the accretion disk.

a sub-millimeter map of the cool dust around the most embedded stars. The
near-infrared emission is offset from the dust peak suggesting a shift in the
location of star formation over the history of the core. The CS emission is
concentrated toward the core center but N2H+ peaks in two main cores offset
from the center, opposite to the chemistry observed in low mass cores. A
starless core with strong CS but weak N2H+ emission is found toward the western
edge of the region. The average CS(2-1) spectrum over the cluster forming core
is asymmetrically self-absorbed suggesting infall. We analyze the large scale
dynamics by applying a one-dimensional radiative transfer code to a model
spherical core with constant temperature and linewidth, and a density profile
measured from an archival 850 micron map of the region. The best fit model that
matches the three CS profiles requires a low CS abundance in the core and an
outer, infalling envelope with a low density and undepleted CS abundance. The
integrated intensities of the two N2H+ lines is well matched with a constant
N2H+ abundance. The envelope infall velocity is tightly constrained by the
CS(2-1) asymmetry and is sub-sonic but the size of the infalling region is
poorly determined. The picture of a high density center with depleted CS slowly
accreting a low density outer envelope with normal CS abundance suggests that
core growth occurs at least partially by the dissipation of turbulent support
on large scales.

emission geometry of this pulsar and show that the angle between the rotation
and the magnetic axes is less than 5 deg. We see evidence for as many as 6 to 7
drifting bands in the main pulse at 318 MHz, which are part of a circulating
system of about 15 spark-associated subpulse emission beams. We provide
quantitative treatments of the aliasing problem and various effects of
geometry. The observed drift rate is an aliased version of the true drift rate,
such that a subpulse drifts to the location of the adjacent subpulse (or a
multiple thereof) in about one pulsar period. We show that small variations, of
the order of 3-8%, in the mean drift rate are then enough to explain the
apparent reversals of drift direction. We find the mean circulation time of the
drift pattern to be significantly longer than the predictions of the original
RS75 model and propose an explanation for this, based on modified models with
temperature regulated partial ion flow in the polar vacuum gap. From the
variation of the mean subpulse separation across the main pulse window, we show
that the spark pattern is not centred around the dipole axis, but around a
point much closer (within a degree or so) to the rotation axis -- we discuss
the implication of this.

search for innovative materials. The utility of non-covalently bonded films is
limited because they are mechanically unstable and consist of poorly connected
domains. Consequently, charge transfers in these films are limited to the
distances in the order of a micrometer. Here we show that a recently developed
gas phase assembling method (Burtman, V., Zelichenok, A., Yitzchaik, S. (1999)
Angewandte Chemie Inter. Ed. 38, 2041-2045.), which produces robust dense
monolayers of NTCDI covalently attached to the surface of silicon, allows one
to overcome this scale limitation. These virtually insulating monolayers can be
photo-chemically populated with cation-radicals via ejection of electrons into
the semi-conducting base. The positive charges of cation-radicals can migrate
as far as several millimeters within microseconds in a random walk fashion thus
demonstrating the macroscopic connectivity of the film. Since the charges exist
as cation-radicals, which are potent oxidants, their migration is coupled to
transfer of the free energy of their reduction and is driven by the redox
potential gradient. Reduction of cation-radicals by an anode converts this free
energy into electromotive force. We show how these films can be implemented in
solar energy conversion and basic time-resolved distance-controlled studies of
sequences of ultra-fast electron transfers.

charge, spin, or energy transport, to enable new sensors with unprecedented
measurement capabilities. Electrical and thermal transport in these mesoscopic
systems typically involves wave propagation through a nanoscale geometry such
as a quantum wire. In this paper we present a general theoretical technique to
describe wave propagation through a curved wire of uniform cross-section and
lying in a plane, but of otherwise arbitrary shape. The method consists of (i)
introducing a local orthogonal coordinate system, the arclength and two locally
perpendicular coordinate axes, dictated by the shape of the wire; (ii)
rewriting the wave equation of interest in this system; (iii) identifying an
effective scattering potential caused by the local curvature; and (iv), solving
the associated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the scattering matrix. We carry
out this procedure in detail for the scalar Helmholtz equation with both
hard-wall and stress-free boundary conditions, appropriate for the mesoscopic
transport of electrons and (scalar) phonons. A novel aspect of the phonon case
is that the reflection probability always vanishes in the long-wavelength
limit, allowing a simple perturbative (Born approximation) treatment at low
energies. Our results show that, in contrast to charge transport, curvature
only barely suppresses thermal transport, even for sharply bent wires, at least
within the two-dimensional scalar phonon model considered. Applications to
experiments are also discussed.

  analysis","21 pages, 1 Appendix, 1 figure; to be submitted to J. Phys. Chem. A",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.optics",,"  The use of ultrafast pump-probe conductivity (PPC) for studies of
photoelectron dynamics in nonpolar molecular liquids has been based upon the
perturbation of geminate recombination dynamics of trapped electrons by their
laser photoexcitation into the conduction band. Such a method is unsuitable for
the studies of electron trapping dynamics of quasifree electrons per se. We
demonstrate that the PPC method can be extended to study such dynamics,
provided that the time resolution of the conductivity setup is better than the
ratio mu[e_qf]tau[e_qf]/mu[e_trap] of the mobility-lifetime product for the
quasifree electron and the mobility of the trapped electron. For some liquids
(e.g., supercritical CO2) this time is sufficiently long (> 100 ns) and the
standard conductivity equipment can be used. Even if the time resolution cannot
be increased (due to the adverse effect on the sensitivity), the trapping
dynamics can be studied provided that the trapping competes with cross
recombination of quasifree electrons with holes in the solvent bulk. Since the
mobility of these quasifree electrons is very large (10-10^3 cm^2/Vs), this
recombination is facile even when the density of ionization events is fairly
low (< 1 mM). Perturbation of the geminate electron-hole dynamics is not
required for this method to work.

  A study with square and tetrahedral lattice models","16 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables. Accepted by J. Chem. Phys",,"10.1063/1.1756573",,"q-bio.BM",,"  In simple models side chains are often represented implicitly (e.g., by
spin-states) or simplified as one atom. We study side chain effects using
square lattice and tetrahedral lattice models, with explicitly side chains of
two atoms. We distinguish effects due to chirality and effects due to side
chain flexibilities, since residues in proteins are L-residues, and their side
chains adopt different rotameric states. Short chains are enumerated
exhaustively. For long chains, we sample effectively rare events (eg, compact
conformations) and obtain complete pictures of ensemble properties of these
models at all compactness region. We find that both chirality and reduced side
chain flexibility lower the folding entropy significantly for globally compact
conformations, suggesting that they are important properties of residues to
ensure fast folding and stable native structure. This corresponds well with our
finding that natural amino acid residues have reduced effective flexibility, as
evidenced by analysis of rotamer libraries and side chain rotatable bonds. We
further develop a method calculating the exact side-chain entropy for a given
back bone structure. We show that simple rotamer counting often underestimates
side chain entropy significantly, and side chain entropy does not always
correlate well with main chain packing. Among compact backbones with maximum
side chain entropy, helical structures emerges as the dominating
configurations. Our results suggest that side chain entropy may be an important
factor contributing to the formation of alpha helices for compact
conformations.
