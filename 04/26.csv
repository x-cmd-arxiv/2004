important that we use model-independent and optimal methods. We should probe
dark energy using its density (allowed to be a free function of cosmic time)

effect on supernovae by flux-averaging. We need to include complementary data
(for example, from the Cosmic Microwave Background [CMB] and large scale
structure [LSS]) in a consistent manner to help break the degeneracy between
the dark energy density and the matter density fraction. We should push for
ambitious future supernova surveys that can observe a large number of
supernovae at the highest possible redshifts. I discuss these and other issues
that will be important in our quest to unravel the mystery of the nature of
dark energy.
  Current supernova, CMB, and LSS data already rule out dark energy models with
dark energy densities that vary greatly with time; with the cosmological
constant model providing an excellent fit to the data. A precise measurement of
dark energy density as a free function of cosmic time will have a fundamental
impact on particle physics and cosmology.

described in this paper, which we hereafter call the Mitaka model, we
extensively investigate the observed scaling relations of galaxies among
photometric, kinematic, structural and chemical characteristics. In such a
scenario, spheroidal galaxies are assumed to be formed by major merger and
subsequent starburst, in contrast to the traditional scenario of monolithic
cloud collapse. As a new ingredient of SAMs, we introduce the effects of
dynamical response to supernova-induced gas removal on size and velocity
dispersion, which play an important role on dwarf galaxy formation. In previous
theoretical studies of dwarf galaxies based on the monolithic cloud collapse
given by Yoshii & Arimoto and Dekel & Silk, the dynamical response was treated
in the extremes of a purely baryonic cloud and a baryonic cloud fully supported
by surrounding dark matter. To improve this simple treatment, in our previous
paper, we formulated the dynamical response in more realistic, intermediate
situations between the above extremes. While the effects of dynamical response
depend on the mass fraction of removed gas from a galaxy, how much amount of
the gas remains just after major merger depends on the star formation history.
A variety of star formation histories are generated through the Monte Carlo
realization of merging histories of dark halos, and it is found that our SAM
naturally makes a wide variety of dwarf galaxies and their dispersed
characteristics as observed. (Abridged)

instantaneous recycling for type II supernovae (SNe II). We find that our model
reproduces well the metal abundance ratio [O/Fe] against [Fe/H] and the {iron
metallicity distribution function} in the solar neighborhood. This means that
the so-called G-dwarf problem is resolved by the hierarchical formation of
galaxies, and a gas infall term introduced in traditional monolithic collapse
models to solve this problem is well explained by the mixture of some physical
processes such as hierarchical merging of dark halos, gas cooling, energy
feedback and injection of gas and metals into hot gas due to supernovae. Our
model predicts more oxygen-enhanced stars in bulges at [Fe/H] $\simeq 0$ than

balance between IR and Hbeta luminosities (A_V(IR)). For most of the z>0.4

astrophysics. The success of the Cold Dark Matter cosmological model argues
strongly in favor of a major component of the dark matter being in the form of
elementary particles, not yet discovered. Based on earlier theoretical
considerations, a possible link between the recent SPI/INTEGRAL measurement of
an intense and extended emission of 511 keV photons (positron annihilation)
from the central Galaxy, and this mysterious component of the Universe, has
been established advocating the existence of a light dark matter particle at
variance with the neutralino, in general considered as very heavy. We show that
it can explain the 511 keV emission mapped with SPI/INTEGRAL without
overproducing undesirable signals like high energy gamma-rays arising from
$\pi^\circ$ decays, and radio synchrotron photons emitted by high energy
positrons circulating in magnetic fields. Combining the annihilation line
constraint with the cosmological one (i.e. that the relic LDM energy density
reaches about 23% of the density of the Universe), one can restrict the main
properties of the light dark matter particle. Its mass should lie between 1 and
100 MeV, and the required annihilation cross section, velocity dependent,
should be significantly larger than for weak interactions, and may be induced
by the virtual production of a new light neutral spin 1 boson $U$. On
astrophysical grounds, the best target to validate the LDM proposal seems to be
the observation by SPI/INTEGRAL and future gamma ray telescopes of the
annihilation line from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Palomar-13 globular
cluster, thought to be dominated by dark matter.

explain the rate of positron injection in the Galactic bulge, estimated to more
than 10$^{43}$ s$^{-1}$, the most commonly considered positron injection
sources are type Ia supernovae. However, SN Ia rate estimations show that those
sources fall short to explain the observed positron production rate, raising a
challenging question about the nature of the Galactic positron source. In this
context, a possible source of Galactic positrons could be supernova events of a
new type, as the recently observed SN2003dh/GRB030329, an exploding Wolf-Rayet

question about the rate of this kind of events remains open, but could be
problematically low.

amount of $^{56}$Ni is ejected in a cone with a very high velocity; the ejected

temperature kT_bb ~ 0.12--0.14 keV. These spectral features, and the inferred
luminosity ~ 10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3--12 keV band, are typical of bright ULXs
in nearby dwarf galaxies. The blackbody plus power-law model is a significantly
better fit than either a simple power law or a broken power law (although the
latter model is also acceptable at some epochs). Doppler-boosted emission from
a relativistic jet is not required, although we cannot rule out this scenario.
Our preliminary timing analysis shows flaring behaviour which we interpret as
variability in the power-law component, on timescales of ~ 10^2 s. The hard
component is suppressed during the dips, while the soft thermal component is
consistent with being constant. The power density spectrum is flat at low
frequencies, has a break at f_b ~ 2.5 mHz, and has a slope ~ -1 at higher
frequencies. A comparison with the power spectra of Cyg X-1 and of a sample of
other BH candidates and AGN suggests a mass of ~ 10^2 M_sun. It is also
possible that the BH is at the upper end of the stellar-mass class (M ~ 50
M_sun), in a phase of moderately super-Eddington accretion. The formation of
such a massive BH via normal stellar evolution may have been favoured by the
very metal-poor environment of NGC 5408.

power-law solutions of theories with no divergence in the speed of sound. After
that, we argue that the requirement of a divergent sound speed at some point
fixes uniquely the form of the Lagrangian to be exactly the one considered
earlier and prove the asymptotic stability of the most interesting solutions
belonging to the divergent theory. Then, we discuss the implications having not
just k-essence but also matter. This is interesting because introducing another
component breaks the rigidity of the theory, and the form of the potential
ceases to be unique as happened in the pure k-essence case. Finally, we show
the finiteness of the effective sound speed under an appropiate definition.

both. We estimate a mass-loss rate of ~2e-5 Msun/yr from the main evaporating

non-static, the general solution of the field equations on the brane can be
obtained in an exact parametric form, with the conformal factor taken as
parameter. As a physical application of the obtained solutions we consider the
behavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable circular
orbit. In this case the tangential velocity can be expressed as a function of
the conformal factor and some integration constants only. For a specific range
of the integration constants, the tangential velocity of the test particle
tends, in the limit of large radial distances, to a constant value. This
behavior is specific to the galactic rotation curves, and is explained usually
by invoking the hypothesis of the dark matter. The limiting value of the
angular velocity of the test particle can be obtained as a function of the
baryonic mass and radius of the galaxy. The behavior of the dark radiation and
dark pressure terms is also considered in detail, and it is shown that they can
be expressed in terms of the rotational velocity of a test particle. Hence all
the predictions of the present model can be tested observationally. Therefore
the existence of the non-local effects, generated by the free gravitational
field of the bulk in a conformally symmetric brane, may provide an explanation

referred to the minisuperspace; the new approach is based on fixing a Gaussian
(or synchronous) reference frame and then quantizing the system via the
reconstruction of a suitable constraint; then the quantum dynamics is re-stated
in a generic coordinates system and it becomes dependent on the lapse function.
The analysis follows a parallelism with the case of the non-relativistic
particle and leads to the minisuperspace implementation of the so-called {\em
kinematical action} as proposed in \cite{M02} (here almost coinciding also with
the approach presented in \cite{KT91}). The new constraint leads to a
Schr\""odinger equation for the system. i.e. to non-vanishing eigenvalues for
the super-Hamiltonian operator; the physical interpretation of this feature
relies on the appearance of a ``dust fluid'' (non-positive definite) energy
density, i.e. a kind of ``materialization'' of the reference frame. As an
example of minisuperspace model, we consider a Bianchi type IX Universe, for
which some dynamical implications of the revised canonical quantum gravity are
discussed. We also show how, on the classical limit, the presence of the dust
fluid can have relevant cosmological issues. Finally we upgrade our analysis by
its extension to the generic cosmological solution, which is performed in the
so-called long-wavelength approximation. In fact, near the Big-Bang, we can
neglect the spatial gradients of the dynamical variables and arrive to
implement, in each space point, the same minisuperspace paradigm valid for the
Bianchi IX model.

though the fundamental fields are constrained to the first Brillouin zone,

that the Coulomb corrections to the differential cross section are very

equivalency of inertial systems and at the same time would provide a tool to
define their speed, which should be equal to that relative to the CMB for being
congruent.

eigenvalues. It is shown that by introducing a spin gauge field a particle with
a spin can be described as a spin multiplet of scalar particles situated in a
non-Abelian pure gauge (forceless) field U(n). As the result, one can create a
theory of particle evolution that is gauge invariant with regards to the group
U^n(1). Due to this, in the adiabatic (Abelian) approximation the spin gauge
field is an analogue of n electromagnetic fields U(1) on the extended phase
space of the particle. These fields are force ones, and the forces of their
action enter the particle motion equations that are derived in the paper in the
general form. The motion equations describe the topological spin transport,
pumping and splitting. The Berry phase is represented in this theory
analogously to the Dirac phase of a particle in an electromagnetic field. Due
to the analogy with the electromagnetic field, the theory becomes natural in
the four-dimensional form. Besides the general theory the article considers a
number of important particular examples, both known and new.

measurement-based computation, and for establishing a new upper bound of the
minimal resources needed to quantum universality, a formal model is introduced
by means of Measurement-based Quantum Turing Machines.

open quantum systems. We define the adiabatic limit of an open quantum system
as the regime in which its dynamical superoperator can be decomposed in terms
of independently evolving Jordan blocks. We then establish validity and
invalidity conditions for this approximation and discuss their applicability to
superoperators changing slowly in time. As an example, the adiabatic evolution
of a two-level open system is analysed.

transformation [D. Jonathan and M. B. Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{83},
3566 (1999)]. Furthermore, we show that the combination of multiple-copy
entanglement transformation and the entanglement-assisted one is still
equivalent to the pure entanglement-assisted one. The mathematical structure of
multiple-copy entanglement transformations then is carefully investigated. Many
interesting properties of multiple-copy entanglement transformations are
presented, which exactly coincide with those satisfied by the
entanglement-assisted ones. Most interestingly, we show that an arbitrarily
large number of copies of state should be considered in multiple-copy
entanglement transformations.
