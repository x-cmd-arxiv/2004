The study is motivated by results on the effects of three-body recombination in
Bose-Einstein condensates, as well as by the important recent work of Segur et
al. on the effects of linear damping in NLS settings. We show how the presence
of even the weakest possible dissipation suppresses the instability on a longer
time scale. However, on a shorter scale, the instability growth may take place,
and a corresponding generalization of the MI criterion is developed. The
analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations. The method is
valid for any power-law dissipation form, including the constant dissipation as
a special case.

investigated in the framework of the low-energy effective theory. A special
emphasis is placed on establishing the correspondence between classical and
quantum theories, for which purpose transformation properties of the
\hbar^0-order radiative contributions to the effective gravitational field
under deformations of a reference frame are determined. Using the
Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism it is shown that the one-loop contributions
violate the principle of general covariance, in the sense that the quantities
which are classically invariant under such deformations take generally
different values in different reference frames. In particular, variation of the
scalar curvature under transitions between different reference frames is
calculated explicitly. Furthermore, the long-range properties of the two-point
correlation function of the gravitational field are examined. Using the
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism it is proved that this function is finite in the
coincidence limit outside the region of particle localization. In this limit,
the leading term in the long-range expansion of the correlation function is
calculated explicitly, and the relative value of the root mean square
fluctuation of the Newton potential is found to be 1/\sqrt{2}. It shown also
that in the case of a macroscopic gravitating body, the terms violating general
covariance, and the field fluctuation are both suppressed by a factor 1/N,
where N is the number of particles in the body. This leads naturally to a
macroscopic formulation of the correspondence between classical and quantum
theories of gravitation. As an application of the obtained results, the secular
precession of a test particle orbit in the field of a black hole is determined.

investigated.
  If the moment of inertia is also constant along the orbit, the triangle whose
vertexes are the positions of the bodies, and the triangle whose perimeters are
the momenta of the bodies, are always similar (``synchronised similar
triangles''). This similarity yields kinematic equalities between mutual
distances and magnitude of momenta. Moreover, if the orbit is a solution to the
equation of motion under homogeneous potential, the orbit has a new constant
involving momenta.
  For orbits with zero angular momentum and non-constant moment of inertia, we
introduce scaled variables, positions divided by square root of the moment of
inertia and momenta derived from the velocity of the scaled positions. Then the
similarity and the kinematic equalities hold for the scaled variables. Using
this similarity, we prove that any bounded three-body orbit with zero angular
momentum under homogeneous potential whose degree is smaller than 2 has
infinitely many collinear configurations (syzygies or eclipses) or collisions.

method (RGM) using the spin-flavor SU_6 quark-model wave functions and
effective meson-exchange potentials at the quark level. Model parameters are
determined to reproduce properties of the nucleon-nucleon system and the
low-energy cross section data for the hyperon-nucleon scattering. Due to the
several improvements including the introduction of vector-meson exchange
potentials, fss2 has achieved very accurate description of the NN and YN
interactions, comparable to various one-boson exchange potentials. We review

through the quantum erasing process, in which an atom is coupled with two mode
fields via the interaction governed by the two-mode two-photon Jaynes-Cummings
model. The influence of phase decoherence on the entanglement of two mode
fields is discussed. It is found that quantum erasing process can transfer part
of entanglement between the atom and fields to two mode fields initially in the
thermal states. The entanglement achieved by fields heavily depends on their
initial temperature and the detuning. The entanglement of stationary state is
also investigated.
