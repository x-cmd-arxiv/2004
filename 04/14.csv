self-consistent cosmological framework in which our analysis was undertaken
allows us to explore satellite disruption within live host potentials, a
natural complement to earlier work conducted within static potentials. Our host
halos were chosen to sample a variety of formation histories, ages, and
triaxialities; despite their obvious differences, we find striking similarities
within the associated substructure populations. Namely, all satellite orbits
follow nearly the same eccentricity distribution with a correlation between
eccentricity and pericentre. We also find that the destruction rate of the
substructure population is nearly independent of the mass, age, and triaxiality
of the host halo. There are, however, subtle differences in the velocity
anisotropy of the satellite distribution. We find that the local velocity bias
at all radii is greater than unity for all halos and this increases as we move
closer to the halo centre, where it varies from 1.1 to 1.4. For the global
velocity bias we find a small but slightly positive bias, although when we
restrict the global velocity bias calculation to satellites that have had at
least one orbit, the bias is essentially removed.

of the uneven distribution of the debris and the existence of a ``tidal tail''

structure constant alpha. The most statistically significant portion of this
sample involves the comparison of Mg and Fe wavelength shifts using the
many-multiplet (MM) method. However, the sensitivity of this method to the
abundance of heavy isotopes, especially Mg, is enough to imitate an apparent
variation in alpha in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.8. We implement recent
yields of intermediate mass (IM) stars into a chemical evolution model and show
that the ensuing isotope distribution of Mg can account for the observed
variation in alpha provided the early IMF was particularly rich in intermediate
mass stars (or the heavy Mg isotope yields from AGB stars are even higher than
in present-day models). As such, these observations of quasar absorption
spectra can be used to probe the nucleosynthetic history of low-metallicity
damped Lyman-alpha systems in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.8. This analysis,
in conjunction with other abundance measurements of low-metallicity systems,
reinforces the mounting evidence that star formation at low metallicities may
have been strongly influenced by a population of IM stars. Such IM stars have a
significant influence on other abundances, particularly nitrogen. We constrain
our models with independent measurements of N, Si, and Fe in damped Lyman-alpha
systems as well as C/O in low-metallicity stars. In this way, we obtain
consistent model parameters for this chemical-evolution interpretation of the

different brightness levels, named the 'faint' and 'bright' states. The
differences in brightness are caused by long-term variations in the mass
transfer rate from the secondary star. Eclipse maps of the steady-light show
enhanced emission along the ballistic stream trajectory, in a clear evidence of
gas stream overflow. We identify two different and independent sources of
flickering in V2051 Oph. Low-frequency flickering arises in the overflowing gas
stream and is associated to the mass transfer process. It maximum emission
occurs at the position of closest approach of the gas stream to the white
dwarf, and its spatial distribution changes in response to variations in mass
transfer rate. High-frequency flickering originates in the accretion disk,
showing a radial distribution similar to that of the steady-light maps and no
evidence of emission from the hot spot, gas stream or white dwarf. This disk
flickering component has a relative amplitude of about 3 per cent of the steady
disk light, independent of disk radius and brightness state. If the disk
flickering is caused by fluctuations in the energy dissipation rate induced by
MHD turbulence, its relative amplitude lead to a viscosity parameter alpha=
0.1-0.2 at all radii for the quiescent disk. This value seems uncomfortably
high to be accommodated by the disk instability model [abridged].

adequate parameterization of this gas. The ionization parameter of the two
components is \xi ~6 erg/cm2/s and \xi ~90 erg/cm2/s, respectively. The
observed continuum photon index (Gamma ~1.9) is typical for Seyfert 1 galaxies.
Two significant emission lines are detected at 0.57 keV and 6.4 keV,
respectively. The former is mostly likely due to He-like oxygen triplet
emission arising from an ionized plasma (maybe the warm absorber itself). The
latter is due to fluorescent emission of K-shell iron in a low-ionization state
(FeI--XV). The upper limit for the line width of sigma_{K\alpha} <0.18 keV most
likely rules out an origin in the inner parts of the accretion disk.
Interestingly, the strength of such line is consistent with the possibility
that the emission is produced in the warm absorber itself. However, a
substantial contribution from the torus is plausible too. We have also found a
weak (4% of the primary continuum) soft excess emission component. The presence
of this excess could be explained by either emission/scattering from a warm gas

previously known dwarf spheroidal companion, Andromeda V, also observed by
SDSS. Andromeda IX is the lowest surface brightness galaxy found to date
(mu_{V} ~ 26.8 mag arcsec^-2), and at the distance we estimate from the

describes how jets are launched by young stellar objects, when applied to
system containing disk-accreting white dwarfs naturally explain the otherwise
surprising absence of jets in cataclysmic variable stars. Our main argument
uses the crucial element of the thermal model, namely that the accreted
material is strongly shocked due to large gradients of physical quantities in
the boundary layer, and then cools on a time scale longer than its ejection
time from the disk. In our scenario the magnetic fields are weak, and serve
only to recollimate the outflow at large distances from the source, or to
initiate the shock, but not as a jet-driving agent. Using two criteria in that
model, for the shock formation and for the ejection of mass, we find the mass
accretion rate above which jets could be blown from accretion disks around
young stellar objects and white dwarfs. We find that these accretion mass rates
are ~10^{-7} Mo/yr, and ~10^{-6} Mo/yr for young stellar objects and white
dwarfs respectively. Considering the uncertainties of the model, these limits
could overestimate the critical value by a factor of ~10.

spectrum which is assumed to be the most likely value. Such superimposed,
stochastic waves may occur in a convectively active environment. They cause
nucleation fronts and nucleation events and thereby initiate the dust formation
process which continues until all condensible material is consumed. Small
disturbances are found to have a large impact on the dust forming system. An
initially dust-hostile region, which may originally be optically thin, becomes
optically thick in a patchy way showing considerable variations in the dust
properties during the formation process. The dust appears in lanes and curls as
a result of the interaction with waves, i.e. turbulence, which form larger and
larger structures with time. Aiming on a physical understanding of the

general diagrammatic approximation scheme based on a fully renormalized
computation of two-particle vertex functions in the spin and in the charge

independent Pauli spin susceptibility for temperatures below the Kondo

the exact spin screening in the Fermi liquid state. The impurity spectral
density appears to remain non-singular down to the lowest temperatures, in
agreement with Fermi liquid behavior. However, the unitarity sum rule, which is
crucial for an impurity solver like the CTMA to be applicable within Dynamical
Mean Field Theories for strongly correlated lattice models, is overestimated at
the lowest temperatures. We argue that this shortcoming may be due to numerical
imprecision and discuss an appropriate scheme for its correction. In the
two-channel case, the spectral density calculated within CTMA exhibit
qualitatively the correct non-Fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures, i.e. a

$n_c$ for surface impurity concentration $n_S$, which separates the two regimes
for surface impurity effects on the zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). Below
the threshold, surface impurities do not broaden the ZBCP, but effectively
reduce its weight and generate impurity bands. For low $n_S$ impurity bands can
be, in principle, resolved experimentally, being centered at energies of bound
states induced by an isolated impurity on the surface. For larger $n_S$
impurity bands are distorted, move to lower energies and, beginning with the

increasing $n_S$ above the threshold, the ZBCP is quickly destroyed in the case

complex can be elegantly summarized in a purely topological action of the

we prove that for every network with expansion alpha, a large connected
component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for
up to a constant times alpha n faults. This result is tight in the sense that
every graph G of size n and uniform expansion alpha(.), i.e. G has an expansion
of alpha(n) and every subgraph G' of size m of G has an expansion of
O(alpha(m)), can be broken into sublinear components with omega(alpha(n) n)
faults.
  For random faults we observe that the situation is significantly different,
because in this case the expansion of a graph only gives a very weak bound on
its resilience to random faults. More specifically, there are networks of
uniform expansion O(sqrt{n}) that are resilient against a constant fault
probability but there are also networks of uniform expansion Omega(1/log n)
that are not resilient against a O(1/log n) fault probability. Thus, a
different parameter is needed. For this we introduce the span of a graph which
allows us to determine the maximum fault probability in a much better way than
the expansion can. We use the span to show the first known results for the
effect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.

assuming that ETC interactions are electroweak generation conserving even if
technicolor has a walking gauge coupling. Large ETC gauge boson masses and
small intergenerational mixing then result in negligibly small ETC

We confirm our earlier strong lower bounds on TC2 gauge boson masses from

the primordial fermions split into three families identified with regular

density, the theory allows transition to new type of states. The possibility of
such Cosmo-Low Energy Physics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of
solutions of the field theory equations describing FRW universe filled with
homogeneous scalar field and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos.
Neutrinos in CLEP state are drawn into cosmological expansion by means of
dynamically changing their own parameters. One of the features of the fermions
in CLEP state is that in the late time universe their masses increase as
a^{3/2} (a=a(t) is the scale factor). The energy density of the cold dark
matter consisting of neutrinos in CLEP state scales as a sort of dark energy;
this cold dark matter possesses negative pressure and for the late time
universe its equation of state approaches that of the cosmological constant.
The total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the
universe free of fermionic matter at all.

collective perturbations corresponding to the smallest positive Lyapunov
exponents (LEs), called hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes. Until now, however, these
modes are only found for hard core systems. Here we report new results on
Lyapunov spectra and Lyapunov vectors (LVs) for Lennard-Jones fluids. By
considering the Fourier transform of the coordinate fluctuation density
$u^{(\alpha)}(x,t)$, it is found that the LVs with $\lambda \approx 0$ are
highly dominated by a few components with low wave-numbers.
  These numerical results provide strong evidence that hydrodynamic Lyapunov
modes do exist in soft-potential systems, although the collective Lyapunov
modes are more vague than in hard-core systems. In studying the density and
temperature dependence of these modes, it is found that, when the value of
Lyapunov exponent $\lambda^{(\alpha)}$ is plotted as function of the dominant
wave number $k_{max}$ of the corresponding LV, all data from simulations with
different densities and temperatures collapse onto a single curve. This shows
that the dispersion relation $\lambda^{(\alpha)}$ vs. $k_{max}$ for
hydrodynamical Lyapunov modes appears to be universal irrespective of the
particle density and temperature of the system.
  Despite the wave-like character of the LVs, no step-like structure exists in
the Lyapunov spectrum of the systems studied here, in contrast to the hard-core
case. Further numerical simulations show that the finite-time LEs fluctuate
strongly. We have also investigated localization features of LVs and propose a
new length scale to characterize the Hamiltonian spatio-temporal chaotic

treated carefully, because the shape of the mean-field in such a finite
many-body system as the nucleus strongly changes depending on its
configuration. This situation is clearly shown by applying an adiabatic
assumption, where the most energetically favorable single-particle states are
assumed to be occupied. The excited HF states and the continuously-connected
potential energy curves are given by applying the configuration dictated CHF
method. The effect of pairing correlation is discussed in the level crossing

to and retention of basic physical concepts, a result that was a primary goal
of the `Physics in Films' approach. Following the first offering of the
revitalization of the Physical Science course, in which action and sci-fi films
were the primary source of the scene clips used in class, the instructors have
demonstrated the versatility of the approach by building variations of the
course around other genres, as well --`Physics in Films: Superheroes' and
`Physics in Films: Pseudoscience'. A parallel approach to the general education
course in astronomy is currently being discussed; many others are in our
thoughts.

  Quantum Encryption","11 pages, no figures. In Proceedings of RANDOM 2004, Cambridge, MA,
  August 2004",,,,"quant-ph cs.CR",,"  A quantum encryption scheme (also called private quantum channel, or state
randomization protocol) is a one-time pad for quantum messages. If two parties
share a classical random string, one of them can transmit a quantum state to
the other so that an eavesdropper gets little or no information about the state
being transmitted. Perfect encryption schemes leak no information at all about
the message. Approximate encryption schemes leak a non-zero (though small)
amount of information but require a shorter shared random key. Approximate
schemes with short keys have been shown to have a number of applications in
quantum cryptography and information theory.
  This paper provides the first deterministic, polynomial-time constructions of
quantum approximate encryption schemes with short keys. Previous constructions
(quant-ph/0307104) are probabilistic--that is, they show that if the operators
used for encryption are chosen at random, then with high probability the
resulting protocol will be a secure encryption scheme. Moreover, the resulting
protocol descriptions are exponentially long. Our protocols use keys of the
same length as (or better length than) the probabilistic constructions; to
encrypt $n$ qubits approximately, one needs $n+o(n)$ bits of shared key.
  An additional contribution of this paper is a connection between classical
combinatorial derandomization and constructions of pseudo-random matrix
families in a continuous space.
