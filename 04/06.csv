more effective at detecting terrestrial planets in Earth-like orbits. The poor
sensitivity of the ground-based surveys to low-mass planets is primarily due to
the fact that the main sequence source stars are unresolved in ground-based

that preclude the detection of most of the planetary light curve deviations for

significant hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission, whose flux depends on the ratio
of the energy densities of magnetic to seed photon fields. The Vela region was

presence of neutrinos of all flavors and in the presence of a gravitational
field. When applied to an extensive two-dimensional grid of core radii and
fluid element sizes for each of several time slices of a number of
proto-supernovae, we find no evidence for the neutron finger instability as
described by the Livermore group. We find, instead, that the rate of lepton
equilibration always exceeds that of thermal equilibration. Furthermore, we
find that thermal diffusion driven by a lepton fraction difference and lepton
diffusion driven by an entropy difference are both nonzero and that the first
of these tends to be large in magnitude. An important consequence of this is
the presence of a doubly diffusive instability, which we refer to as
``lepto-entropy fingers,'' in an extensive region below the neutrinosphere
where the lepton number, $Y_{\ell}$, is small. This instability is driven by a
mechanism very different from that giving rise to neutron fingers, and may play
an important role in enhancing the neutrino emission. Deep in the core where
the entropy is low and the lepton number higher, our analysis indicates a
region unstable to another instability which we refer to as ``lepto-entropy
semiconvection.'' These instabilities, particularly lepto-entropy fingers, may
have already been seen in some multi-dimensional core collapse simulations

into account the XUV flux of the parent star (Lammer et al. 2003). Our analysis
leads to the existence of a critical mass for a given orbital distance $m_{\rm
crit}(a)$ below which the evaporation timescale becomes shorter than the
thermal timescale of the planet. For planets with initial masses below $m_{\rm
crit}$, evaporation leads to a rapid expansion of the outer layers and of the
total planetary radius, speeding up the evaporation process. Consequently, the
planet does not survive as long as estimated by a simple application of mass
loss rates without following consistently its evolution. We find out that the
transit planet HD 209458b might be in such a dramatic phase, although with an
extremely small probability. As a consequence, we predict that, after a certain
time, only planets above a value $m_{\rm crit}(a)$ should be present at an
orbital distance $a$ of a star. For planets with initial masses above $m_{\rm

during reionization. We show that the HII regions imprint features on the power
spectrum that allow us to separate histories with discrete bubbles from those
with partial uniform ionization (by, for example, X-rays). We also show that
""double reionization"" scenarios will modify the morphology of the bubbles in
ways that depend on the mechanism through which the first generation of sources
shuts off. If, for example, the transition occurs globally at a fixed redshift,
the first generation imprints a persistent feature on the 21 cm power spectrum.
Finally, we compare our model to one in which voids are ionized first. While
the power spectra of these two models are qualitatively similar, we show that
the underlying distributions of neutral hydrogen differ dramatically and
suggest that other statistical tests can distinguish them. The next generation
of low-frequency radio telescopes will have the sensitivity to distinguish all
of these models and strongly constrain the history and morphology of
reionization.

this variability are two pulsed X-ray flares. Both flares lasted several months
and had well-resolved few-week-long rises. The long rise times of the flares
are a phenomenon not previously reported for this class of object. The epochs
of the flare peaks were MJD 52,218.8+/-4.5 and 52,444.4+/-7.0. Both flares had
shorter rise than fall times. The flares had peak fluxes of 2.21+/-0.16 and
3.00+/-0.13 times the quiescent value. We estimate a total 2-10 keV energy
release of ~2.7x10^40 ergs and ~2.8x10^41 ergs for the flares, assuming a
distance of 5 kpc. We also report large (factor of ~12) changes to the pulsar's
spin-down rate on time scales of weeks to months, shorter than has been
reported previously. We find marginal evidence for correlation between the flux

roughly 25'' X 25'' region centered on IRc2 down to a flux limit of ~250 mJy.
Many of the known infrared (IR) sources in the region break up into smaller
sub-components. We have also detected 6 new mid-IR sources. Nearly all of the
sources are resolved in our mosaic. The near-IR source ''n'' is slightly
elongated in the mid-IR along a NW--SE axis and perfectly bisects the
double-peaked radio source ''L''. Source n has been identified as a candidate
for powering the large IR luminosity of the BN/KL region (L = 10^5 L_sun). We
postulate that the 12 micron emission arises in a circumstellar disk
surrounding source n. The morphology of the mid-IR emission and the Orion ''hot

masers, is very suggestive of a bipolar cavity centered on source n and aligned
with the rotation axis of the hypothetical circumstellar disk. IRc2, once
thought to be the dominant energy source for the BN/KL region, clearly breaks
into 4 sub-sources in our mosaic, as seen previously at 3.8 -- 5.0 micron. The
anti-correlation of mid-IR emission and NH_3 emission from the nearby hot core
indicates that the IRc2 sources are roughly coincident (or behind) the dense

Attention subsequently turned to the 6.6-GHz 5(1)-6(0) A+ methanol maser
transition, which has proved a valuable tracer of early high-mass star
formation. We have undertaken a new search for 23.1-GHz methanol masers in 50
southern star formation regions using the Parkes radiotelescope. The target

sources also displaying maser features in the 107.0-GHz 3(1)-4(0) A+ methanol

was detected in the remaining sources. Thus the 23.1-GHz methanol masers are
rare. A maser model in which methanol molecules are pumped to the second
torsionally excited state by radiation from warm dust can account for class II
maser activity in all the transitions in which it is observed. According to
this model the 23.1-GHz maser is favoured by conditions representing low gas
temperature, high external dust temperature, low gas density, and high column
density of methanol; the scarcity of this maser indicates that such
combinations of conditions are uncommon. We have undertaken new model

clusters by minimising the non-thermal energy density contained in cosmic ray
electrons (CRe), protons (CRp), and magnetic fields. The classical minimum
energy estimate can be constructed independently of the origin of the radio
synchrotron emitting CRe yielding thus an absolute minimum of the non-thermal
energy density. Provided the observed synchrotron emission is generated by a
CRe population originating from hadronic interactions of CRp with the ambient
thermal gas of the intra-cluster medium, the parameter space of the classical
scenario can be tightened by means of the hadronic minimum energy criterion.
For both approaches, we derive the theoretically expected tolerance regions for
the inferred minimum energy densities. Application to the radio halo of the
Coma cluster and the radio mini-halo of the Perseus cluster yields
equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields within the expected
tolerance regions. In the hadronic scenario, the inferred central magnetic
field strength ranges from 2.4 muG (Coma) to 8.8 muG (Perseus), while the
optimal CRp energy density is constrained to 2% +/- 1% of the thermal energy
density (Perseus). We discuss the possibility of a hadronic origin of the Coma
radio halo while current observations favour such a scenario for the Perseus
radio mini-halo. Combining future expected detections of radio synchrotron,
hard X-ray inverse Compton, and hadronically induced gamma-ray emission should
allow an estimate of volume averaged cluster magnetic fields and provide
information about their dynamical state.

yields. Stellar particles are split in two populations: the old one is present
at the beginning of the simulation and is calibrated according to various ages

inherits the metallicity of the gas particles. The results have been calibrated
in four wavebands with the spectro-photometric evolutionary model GISSEL2000

rest-frame morphological and bidimensional photometric analysis has been
performed on simulated images, with the same tools as for observations. The
effects of the stellar bar formation and the linked star formation episode on
the global properties of the galaxy (mass and luminosity distribution, colours,
isophotal radii) have been analysed. In particular, we have disentangled the
effects of stellar evolution from dynamic evolution to explain the cause of the
isophotal radii variations. We show that the dynamic properties (e.g. mass) of
the area enclosed by any isophotal radius depends on the waveband and on the
level of star formation activity. It is also shown that the bar isophotes
remain thinner than mass isodensities a long time (> 0.7 Gyr) after the maximum
of star formation rate. We show that bar ellipticity is very wavelength
dependent as suggested by real observations. Effects of dust extinction on
photometric and morphological measurements are systematically quantified.

known, Porb= 12.7 days. The amount of absorption to the system has been
estimated to be Av=4.2+-0.3, which for such an early-type star implies a
distance of about 6.5 kpc. The optical spectra reveal major and rapid changes
in the strength and shape of the Halpha line. The Halpha line was initially
observed as a double peak profile with the ratio of the intensities of the blue

reversed (V/R< 1). Subsequently, in less than a month, the emission ceased and
Halpha appeared in absorption. This fast spectral variability is interpreted
within the viscous decretion disc model and demonstrates the significant role
of the neutron star on the evolution of the circumstellar disc around the Be

brightest cluster galaxy through dissipationless galactic cannibalism can
affect the inner cluster dark matter density profile. In particular, we use as
realistic test case the dynamical evolution of the galaxy cluster C0337-2522 at
redshift z=0.59, hosting in its centre a group of five elliptical galaxies
which are likely to be the progenitor of a central giant elliptical. After the
formation of the brightest cluster galaxy, the inner cluster dark matter
density profile is significantly flatter (logarithmic slope 0.49<beta<0.90)
than the original cusp (beta=1), as a consequence of dynamical friction heating
of the massive galaxies against the diffuse cluster dark matter. In our
simulations we have assumed that the cluster galaxies are made of stars only.
We also show that the presence of galactic dark matter haloes can steepen the
cluster central density profile. We conclude that galactic cannibalism could be
a viable physical mechanism to reconcile - at least at the cluster scale - the
flat dark matter haloes inferred observationally in some galaxy clusters with
the steep haloes predicted by cosmological simulations.

clusters as natural Gravitational Telescopes. Evolutionary synthesis models of
PopIII and extremely metal-poor starbursts have been used to derive
observational properties expected for these high-z galaxies, such as expected
magnitudes and colors, line fluxes for the main emission lines, etc. These
models have allowed us to define fairly robust selection criteria to find z~
7-10 galaxies based on broad-band near-IR photometry in combination with the
traditional Lyman drop-out technique. The magnification in the core of lensing
clusters improves the search efficiency and subsequent spectroscopic follow up.
The method used to identify sources and the first results obtained are
presented, in particular the first spectroscopic confirmation of a z=10
candidate. The research efficiency will be significantly improved by the future
near-IR multi-object facilities such as EMIR/GTC and KMOS/VLT-2, and later by

information owing to the close interplay between electronic and vibrational
properties. In this paper, we review the properties of double wall carbon
nanotubes (DWCNTs). In particular, it is shown that SWCNT encapsulating
C$_{60}$, so-called peapods, are transformed into DWCNTs when subject to a high
temperature treatment. The inner tubes are grown in a catalyst free environment
and do not suffer from impurities or defects that are usually encountered for
as-grown SWCNTs or DWCNTs. As a consequence, the inner tubes are grown with a
high degree of perfection as deduced from the unusually narrow radial breathing
mode (RBM) lines. This apostrophizes the interior of the SWCNTs as a nano-clean
room. The mechanism of the inner nanotube production from C$_{60}$ is
discussed. We also report recent studies aimed at the simplification and
industrial scaling up of the DWCNT production process utilizing a low
temperature peapod synthesis method. A splitting of the RBMs of inner tubes is
observed. This is related to the interaction between the two shells of the
DWCNTs as the same inner tube type can be encapsulated in different outer ones.
The sharp appearance of the inner tube RBMs allows a reliable assignment of the
tube modes to (n,m) indexes and thus provides a precise determination of the
relation between the tube diameter and the RBM frequencies.

within the statistical theory proposed by Edwards and co-workers, and the

$q\to 1$ limit of the $q$-state Potts model with inhomogeneous interactions for
all pairs of spins. We apply this approach to the static model having
$P_i\propto i^{-\mu} (0<\mu<1)$ so that the resulting graph is scale-free with
the degree exponent $\lambda=1+1/\mu$. The number of loops as well as the giant
cluster size and the mean cluster size are obtained in the thermodynamic limit
as a function of the edge density, and their associated critical exponents are
also obtained. Finite-size scaling behaviors are derived using the largest
cluster size in the critical regime, which is calculated from the cluster size
distribution, and checked against numerical simulation results. We find that
the process of forming the giant cluster is qualitatively different between the
cases of $\lambda >3$ and $2 < \lambda <3$. While for the former, the giant
cluster forms abruptly at the percolation transition, for the latter, however,
the formation of the giant cluster is gradual and the mean cluster size for
finite $N$ shows double peaks.

differential evolution equations to parallelized C or Fortran code. Kranc can
be used as a ""rapid prototyping"" system for physicists or mathematicians
handling very complicated systems of partial differential equations, but
through integration into the Cactus computational toolkit we can also produce
efficient parallelized production codes. Our work is motivated by the field of
numerical relativity, where Kranc is used as a research tool by the authors. In
this paper we describe the design and implementation of both the Mathematica
packages and the resulting code, we discuss some example applications, and
provide results on the performance of an example numerical code for the

character related to a broken ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetry between integer-charged
bare quarks and leptons. The mechanism is a tunneling process occurring in time
between standard field configurations of a pure gauge form with different
topological winding numbers associated with integer-charged bare quarks in the
far past and future. This transition, which nonperturbatively normalizes local
bare charges with a universal accumulated value, corresponds to a specific
topologically nontrivial configuration of the weak gauge fields in Euclidean
spacetime. The outcome is an effective topological charge equal to the ratio
between baryon number and the number of fermion generations associated with
baryonic matter. The observed conservation of baryon number is then related to
the conservation of this bookkeeping charge on quarks. Baryon number violation
may only arise through topological effects as in decays induced by electroweak
instantons. However, stability of a free proton is expected.

strings from a decaying D-brane with initial conditions perturbed by the
addition of an open string vertex operator. Using an integral formula due to
Selberg, the relevant amplitude is expressed in closed form in terms of zeta
functions. Perturbing the initial state can suppress or enhance the emission of
high energy closed strings for extended branes, but enhances it for D0-branes.
The closed string two point function is expressed as a sum of Toeplitz
determinants of certain hypergeometric functions. A large N limit theorem due
to Szego, and its extension due to Borodin and Okounkov, permits us to compute
approximate results showing that previous naive analytic continuations amount
to the large N approximation of the full result. We also give a free fermion
formulation of scattering from decaying D-branes and describe the relation to a
grand canonical ensemble for a 2d Coulomb gas.

factor proportional to the volume swept out by the ribbons. In a particular

physics. The Cauchy-Riemann relations, characteristical and canonical
relations, the Bianchi identities and others are examples of identical
relations. It can be shown that all these relations express either the
conditions of closure of exterior (skew-symmetric) differential forms and
corresponding dual forms or the properties of closed exterior forms. Since the
closed differential forms are invariant under all transformations, which
conserve the differential (these are gauge transformations: unitary, canonical,
gradient and others), from this it follows that identical relations are a
mathematical representation of relevant invariant and covariant objects.
  The theory of exterior differential forms cannot answer the question of how
do invariant objects appear and what does these objects generate?
  The answer to this question can be obtained using the skew-symmetric
differential forms, which possess the evolutionary properties. The mathematical
apparatus of such evolutionary forms contains nonidentical relations, from
which the identical relations corresponding to invariant objects are obtained
with the help of degenerate transformations. Due to such potentialities, the
mathematical apparatus of skew-symmetrical differential forms enables one to
describe discrete transitions, evolutionary processes and generation of various

discounted or forgotten. Often, models in this subclass have the property of
becoming trapped with probability~1 in some degenerate state. While previous
work has concentrated on such limit results, we concentrate here on a contrary
effect, namely that the time to become trapped may increase exponentially in
1/x as the discount rate, 1-x, approaches~1. As a result, the time to become
trapped may easily exceed the lifetime of the simulation or of the physical

studied, generalizing the notion of usual locality in the most possible way,

natural vertex algebra structure and that any quasi local subset of $\Hom

for a vertex algebra is introduced and it is proved that $W$ is a quasi module
for each of the vertex algebras generated by quasi local subsets of $\Hom

the lifetime distribution for a mean field version of Ecolab is computed,
showing that the fat tail of the distribution is due to coevolutionary adaption

  (2004)",,,"nlin.AO q-bio.PE",,"  The concept of neutral evolutionary networks being a significant factor in
evolutionary dynamics was first proposed by Huynen {\em et al.} about 7 years
ago. In one sense, the principle is easy to state -- because most mutations to
an organism are deleterious, one would expect that neutral mutations that don't
affect the phenotype will have disproportionately greater representation
amongst successor organisms than one would expect if each mutation was equally
likely. So it was with great surprise that I noted neutral mutations being very
rare in a visualisation of phylogenetic trees generated in {\em Tierra}, since
I already knew that there was a significant amount of neutrality in the Tierra
genotype-phenotype map. It turns out that competition for resources between
host and parasite inhibits neutral evolution.

Numerical simulations involving three dimensional tracking of skew rays through
curved fibres demonstrate the characteristics of trapped light. Of practical
interest are the parametrisations of transmission functions and the minimum
permissible radius of curvature. These are of great importance in today's
experiments where high count rates and small numbers of photoelectrons are
encountered. Special emphasis has been placed on the timing resolution of fibre
detectors and its limitation due to variations in the path length of generated

tunneling through a nonstationary potential barrier) is applied to
disintegration of atoms and molecules through tunnel barriers formed by applied
constant and time-dependent electric fields. There are two different channels
for such disintegration, electronic and ionic. The electronic mechanism is
associated with the ionization of a molecule into an electron and a positive
ion. The required frequencies are in a wide range between 100 MHz and infrared.
This mechanism may constitute a method of selective destruction of chemical
bonds. The ionic mechanism consists of dissociation of a molecule into two
ions. Since an ion is more massive than an electron, the necessary frequency is
about 1 MHz. This provides a theoretical possibility of a new method of isotope
separation by radio frequency waves.
