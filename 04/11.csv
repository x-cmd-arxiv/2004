sample is heterogeneous with different orbits and physically different
components from F to M spectral type main sequence stars to G and K giants and
super giants. The computed $U$, $V$, $W$ space velocities indicate the sample
is also heterogeneous in the velocity space. That is, both kinematically
younger and older systems exist among the non-evolved main sequence and the
evolved binaries containing giants and sub giants. The kinematically young
(0.95 Gyr) sub-sample (N=95), which is formed according to the kinematical
criteria of moving groups, was compared to the rest (N=142) of the sample (3.86
Gyr) in order to investigate observational clues of the binary evolution.
Comparing the orbital period histograms between the younger and older
sub-samples, evidences were found supporting Demircan's (1999) finding that the
CAB binaries lose mass (and angular momentum) and evolve towards shorter
orbital periods. The evidence of mass loss is noticeable on the histograms of
the total mass ($M_{h}+M_{c}$), which is compared between the younger
(available only N=53 systems) and older sub-samples (available only N=66
systems). The orbital period decrease during binary evolution is found to be
clearly indicated by the kinematical ages of 6.69, 5.19, and 3.02 Gyr which
were found in the sub samples according to the period ranges of $logP\leq0.8$,
$0.8<logP\leq1.7$, and $1.7<logP\leq3$ among the binaries in the older sub
sample.

imaging of extrasolar planets, particular terrestrial ones. We expect that
within the next decade a space observatory will be launched with the objective
of imaging earthlike planets. Because of the limited lifetime of such a mission
and the large number of potential targets, integration time is a critical
parameter. In fact, integration time is the primary metric in evaluating
various design approaches for the high contrast imaging system. In this paper
we present a new approach to determining the existence of a planet in an
observed system using Bayesian hypothesis testing. Rather than perform
photometry, or rely on vision to determine the existence of a planet, this
approach evaluates the image plane data statistically under certain assumptions
about the prior probability distributions. We show that extremely high
confidence can be achieved in substantially shorter integration times than
conventional photometric methods.

is less populous than Clusters 1 and 2, but presents evidence of being a
physical system. The objects were found optically by inspecting maps obtained
from the Guide Star Catalogue and images from the Digitized Sky Survey. No
previous identification of cluster has been reported in each area so far. The
analysis was carried out with 2MASS photometry in J and H. For Cluster1 we
derive an age of 25 Myr, a reddening E(B-V)=2.18 and a distance from the Sun
1.64kpc; for Cluster2, age of 500Myr, E(B-V)=0.91 and distance 2.19kpc; finally
for Cluster3, age 32-100Myr, E(B-V)=0.94 and distance of 3.93kpc. Luminosity
and mass functions are derived for Clusters1 and 2 which, in turn, allowed us
to estimate their observed masses as 147 and 89 solar masses, respectively.
Estimated total masses, by extrapolating the mass functions to 0.08 solar mass,
amount to 382 and 614 solar masses, for the two clusters. Cluster3 has an
observed mass of 55 solar masses. The present results indicate that further
searches in the optical might still reveal new open clusters, and more so in
infrared bands.

and Ag, over the wavelength range $300nm < \lambda < 400nm$. The particle
diameter considered for ZnO is 50nm and for Ag 20nm. No evidence of light
localization was found. Energy density calculations show that energy is mostly
confined to the region near and in the scattering particles, and that little
energy concentrates in the fields between particles. Gain was added to the ZnO
system by adding a resonant term having Lorentzian line shape with a negative
coefficient, which drives the imaginary part of the dielectric constant
negative corresponding to gain. With gain in the system, the losses can be
compensated; however, localization and loss compensation (which leads to a
lasing threshold) are not connected. These results indicate that similar
calculations with a larger number of scattering sites would still be of
interest. This, however, will require very different numerical techniques than

hierarchical lattice (designed to approximate the cubic lattice), within a
real-space renormalization-group approach. Two different initial probability
distributions for the exchange interaction ($J_{ij}$), Gaussian and uniform,
are used, with zero mean and width $\bar{J}$. The $(kT/\bar{J}) \times
\Delta_0$ phase diagram is obtained, where $T$ is the temperature, $\Delta_0$
is the first moment of the probability distribution for the uniaxial
anisotropy, and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. For the Ising model
($\Delta_0=1$), there is a spin-glass phase at low temperatures (high
$\bar{J}$) and a paramagnetic phase at high temperatures (low $\bar{J}$). For
the isotropic Heisenberg model ($\Delta_0=0$), our results indicate no
spin-glass phase at finite temperatures. The transition temperature between the
spin-glass and paramagnetic phase decreases with $\Delta_0$, as expected, but
goes to zero at a finite value of the anisotropy parameter, namely $\Delta_0 =
\Delta_c \sim 0.59$. Our results indicate that the whole transition line,
between the paramagnetic and the spin-glass phases, for $\Delta_c \leq \Delta_0
< 1$, belongs to the same universality class as the transition for the Ising
spin glass.

the correct physical one is. A point is that the definition of expectation
value is indivisibly connected to the form of generalized relative entropy.
Studying the properties of the relative entropies associated with these two

anyone who is familiar with the language of categories and functors and who has
encountered the definition of a strict 2-category.
  The most remarkable feature of this theory is its simplicity. We build upon
an idea due to Jacques Penon by defining a weak omega category to be a span of
omega magmas with certain properties. (An omega magma is a reflexive, globular
set with a system of partially defined, binary composition operations which
respects the globular structure.)
  Categories, bicategories, strict omega categories and Penon's weak omega
categories are all instances of our weak omega categories. We offer a heuristic
argument to justify the claim that Batanin's weak omega categories also fit
into our framework.
  We show that the Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis is a direct consequence
of our definition of weak omega categories.
  We define a natural notion of a pseudo-functor between weak omega categories
and show that it includes the classical notion of a homomorphism between
bicategories. In any weak omega category the operation of composition with a
fixed 1-cell defines such a pseudo-functor.
  Finally, we define a notion of weak equivalence between weak omega categories
which generalizes the standard definition of an equivalence between ordinary
categories.
