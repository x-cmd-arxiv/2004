non-singular cosmological solutions. We study both the qualitative dynamics of
the homogeneous and isotropic background and the evolution of inhomogeneous
linear perturbations. We calculate the spectrum of perturbations generated on
super-Hubble scales during the collapse phase from initial vacuum fluctuations
on small scales and then evolve these numerically through the bounce. We show
there is a gauge in which perturbations remain well-defined and small
throughout the bounce, even though perturbations in other commonly used gauges
become large or ill-defined. We show that the comoving curvature perturbation
calculated during the collapse phase provides a good estimate of the resulting
large scale adiabatic perturbation in the expanding phase while the Bardeen
metric potential is dominated by what becomes a decaying mode after the bounce.
We show that a power-law collapse phase with scale factor proportional to
$(-t)^{2/3}$ can yield a scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic scalar
perturbations in the expanding phase, but the amplitude of tensor perturbations
places important constraints on the allowed initial conditions.

winds, effects of a meta-galactic UV field and thermal conduction. The
properties of the galaxy populations in two clusters, one Virgo-like (T~3 keV)
and one (sub) Coma-like (T~6 keV), are discussed. The global star formation
rates of the cluster galaxies are found to decrease very significantly with
time from redshift z=2 to 0, in agreement with observations. The total K-band
luminosity of the cluster galaxies correlates tightly with total cluster mass,
and for models without additional AGN feedback, the zero point of the relation
matches the observed one fairly well. The match to observed galaxy luminosity
functions is reasonable, except for a deficiency of bright galaxies (M_B <
-20), which becomes increasingly significant with super-wind strength. Results
of a high resolution test indicate that this deficiency is not due to
``over--merging''. The redshift evolution of the luminosity functions from z=1
to 0 is mainly driven by luminosity evolution, but also by merging of bright
galaxies with the cD. The colour--magnitude relation of the cluster galaxies
matches the observed ""red sequence"" very well and, on average, galaxy
metallicity increases with luminosity. As the brighter galaxies are essentially
coeval, the colour--magnitude relation results from metallicity rather than age
effects, as observed.

branch (RGB, HB, AGB) stars in the globular cluster M5 that are complete to
over 10' from the core for the RGB and AGB samples, and 8' for the HB sample.
The large samples give us the most precise value of R_2 = N_AGB / N_HB to date
for a single globular cluster (0.176 +/- 0.018). This is incompatible with
theoretical calculations using the most recent physical inputs. The discrepancy
can probably be attributed to the dependence of observed R_2 values on
horizontal branch morphology. We identify the cluster M55 as being another
possible example of this effect. Samples of HB and AGB stars in populous
clusters may provide a means of calibrating the masses of horizontal branch
stars in globular clusters. The cumulative luminosity function of the upper red
giant branch shows an apparent deficit of observed stars near the tip of the
branch. This feature has less than a 2% chance of being due to statistical
fluctuations. The slope of the cumulative luminosity function for AGB stars is
consistent with the theoretically predicted value from stellar models when
measurement bias is taken into account. We also introduce a new diagnostic
R_clump that reflects the fraction of the AGB lifetime that a star spends in
the AGB clump. For M5, we find R_clump = 0.42 +/- 0.05, in marginal
disagreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we note that the blue half
of M5's instability strip (where first overtone RR Lyraes reside) is
underpopulated, based on the large numbers of fundamental mode RR Lyraes and on
the nonvariable stars at the blue end of the instability strip. This fact may
imply that the evolutionary tracks (and particularly the colors) of stars in

pressure. Theories of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, including collisionless
MHD turbulence, are discussed, emphasizing various proposals for energy

are reviewed. Models have reproduced many of the basic features of the observed
scaling relations, predicted fast decay rates for supersonic MHD turbulence,
and derived probability distribution functions for density. Thermal
instabilities and thermal phases have a new interpretation in a turbulent

fields, supernovae, and star formation are beginning to resemble the observed
interstellar medium in morphology and statistical properties. The role of
self-gravity in turbulent gas is clarified, leading to new paradigms for the
formation of star clusters, the stellar mass function, the origin of stellar
rotation and binary stars, and the effects of magnetic fields.

(20-1000 keV) between 1991 April and 2000 May (9.1y). Using the Earth
Occultation Technique to extract flux information, a catalog of sources using
data from the BATSE large area detectors has been prepared. The first part of
the catalog consists of results from the monitoring of 58 sources, mostly
Galactic. For these sources, we have included tables of flux and spectral data,
and outburst times for transients. Light curves (or flux histories) have been
placed on the world wide web. We then performed a deep-sampling of 179 objects
(including the aforementioned 58 objects) combining data from the entire 9.1y
BATSE dataset. Source types considered were primarily accreting binaries, but a
small number of representative active galaxies, X-ray-emitting stars, and
supernova remnants were also included. The deep sample results include definite
detections of 83 objects and possible detections of 36 additional objects. The
definite detections spanned three classes of sources: accreting black hole and
neutron star binaries, active galaxies and supernova remnants. Flux data for
the deep sample are presented in four energy bands: 20-40, 40-70, 70-160, and
160-430 keV. The limiting average flux level (9.1 y) for the sample varies from
3.5 to 20 mCrab (5 sigma) between 20 and 430 keV, depending on systematic
error, which in turn is primarily dependent on the sky location. To strengthen
the credibility of detection of weaker sources (5-25 mCrab), we generated Earth
occultation images, searched for periodic behavior using FFT and epoch folding
methods, and critically evaluated the energy-dependent emission in the four
flux bands.

their effect on the long-term evolution of the disk are the studied using 3-D
hydrodynamic simulations. These show that the cooling and heating processes
balance each other, and as a result the disk asymptotes to quasi-equilibrium
within a few orbital periods after the GI onset. The final values of the
internal energy and the Toomre Q are independent of cooling time, while the
asymptotic mass transport rates are inversely proportional to the cooling time.
The formation of dense rings is common in these simulations. GIs fragment into
clumps when the cooling time is on the order of the local orbital time, but the

considerably. GIs are an effective angular momentum and mass transport

calibrators at sub-mm wavelengths because of their rapidly declining flux
densities toward shorter wavelengths. The inability to find a calibrator close
to the target source may limit or even prevent us from imaging many interesting
sources at sub-mm wavelengths. Here, we investigate whether high-mass

them among the brightest sub-mm sources in the sky. Our observations at 0.85 mm

compact unresolved component often remains that when sufficiently strong may
serve as a useful calibrator. These observations also provide a first glimpse
at the small-scale distribution of dust around ultracompact HII regions and

increase in flux over four days, followed by a rapid decrease and flattening of
the light curve afterwards. Superimposed upon these relatively slow variations
several short duration bursts or quasi-periodic oscillations occured with a
typical duration of several hours and separation between 0.6-0.9 days. The
bursts show a delay of the hard X-rays with respect to the soft X-rays of a few
hours. We interprete these bursts as due to a rotating, fluctuating hot spot at
approximately 10 gravitational radii; the time delay of the hard X-rays from
the bursts agree with the canonical picture of Inverse Compton scattering of
the soft accretion disk photons on a hot medium that is relatively close to the
central black hole.

spectral type SC (showing ZrO bands) to CS (showing weak C2). Wavelet analysis
shows that the spectral evolution was accompanied by a dramatic period
increase, from 420 to 540 days, indicating an expanding radius. The pulsation
amplitude also increased. Old photographic plates are used to establish that
the period before 1940 was around 490 days. Chemical models indicate that the
spectral changes were caused by a decrease in stellar temperature, related to
the increasing radius. There is no evidence for a change in C/O ratio. The
evolution in BH Cru is unlikely to be related to an on-going thermal pulse.
Periods of the other SC and CS stars, including nine new periods, are
determined. A second SC star, LX Cyg, also shows evidence for a large increase
in period, and one further star shows a period inconsistent with a previous
determination. Mira periods may be intrinsically unstable for C/O ~ 1; possibly
because of a feedback between the molecular opacities, pulsation amplitude, and
period. LRS spectra of 6 SC stars suggest a feature at wavelength > 15 micron,

propose a solution to this `supersymmetric little hierarchy problem'. We
consider scenarios where the stop masses are relatively heavy - in the 500 GeV
to a TeV range. Radiative stability of the Higgs soft mass against quantum
corrections from the top quark Yukawa coupling is achieved by imposing a global
SU(3) symmetry on this interaction. This global symmetry is only approximate -
it is not respected by the gauge interactions. A subgroup of the global
symmetry is gauged by the familiar SU(2) of the Standard Model. The physical
Higgs is significantly lighter than the other scalars because it is the
pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the breaking of this symmetry. Radiative
corrections to the Higgs potential naturally lead to the right pattern of gauge
and global symmetry breaking. We show that both the gauge and global symmetries
can be embedded into a single SU(6) grand unifying group, thereby maintaining
the prediction of gauge coupling unification. Among the firm predictions of
this class of models are new states with the quantum numbers of 10 and
$\bar{10}$ under SU(5) close to the TeV scale. The Higgs mass is expected to be
below 130 GeV, just as in the MSSM.

the hadronic phase and the color superconducting phase. After a review of
quantum Hall states of electrons in semiconductors, we discuss the properties

evaluate the energy of the states as a function of the coupling constant. We
also analyze solutions of vortex excitations in the states and evaluate their

as expected. On the other hand, with the increase of the chemical potential,
the color superconducting state arises instead of the ferromagnetic state. We

found, one where the curvature is large and gravitons should be confined and
another one which appears to be weakly coupled and tends to be flat. The

generated by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and a linear analysis for both

the Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) limit is approached. Analytical solutions are
found for the inviscid compressible RDT equations at long times. The RDT
equations are also solved numerically for both inviscid and viscous cases. The
RDT solutions, confirmed by the DNS results, show that the even order
transverse derivative moments of the dilatational and solenoidal velocity
fields are anisotropic, with the dilatational motions more anisotropic than
their solenoidal counterparts. The results obtained for the incompressible case
are similar to those obtained for the solenoidal motions in the compressible
case. The DNS results also indicate an increase in the anisotropy of the even
order transverse derivative moments with the order of the moment, in agreement
with the RDT predictions. Although the anisotropy decreases with Reynolds
number, it is likely that for higher even order moments it will persist at
large values of the Reynolds number, in contrast with the postulate of local
isotropy. The RDT solutions also predict that the normalized odd order
transverse derivative moments of the solenoidal velocity for the compressible
case and of the velocity for the incompressible case should approach a constant
different than zero at large times. This prediction is supported by the DNS
data. For higher odd order normalized moments, the RDT analysis suggests that
the anisotropy may persist at large values of the Reynolds number, in agreement

lineages have cast doubts upon the existence of a single molecular clock.
Differences in the timing of evolutionary events estimated from genetic and
fossil evidence have raised further questions about the existence of molecular
clocks and their use. Here we present a model of nucleotide substitution that
combines new theory on metabolic rate with the now classic neutral theory of
molecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity, and
reconciles differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionary
events. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrial
and nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperature
on metabolic rate, a single molecular clock explains heterogeneity in rates of
nucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments.
This model suggests that there is indeed a general molecular clock, as
originally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling, but that it ticks at a constant
substitution rate per unit mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit
time. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combine
to control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.

model is sufficient to describe the observed cycling behavior of single

the collective rotation of the swarm in one direction, we extend the model by
considering avoidance of collisions. Two different ansatzes to model such a
behavior are developed and compared. By means of computer simulations of a
multi-agent system we show that local avoidance - as a special form of
asymmetric repulsion between animals - leads to the emergence of a vortex
swarm. The transition from uncorrelated rotation of single agents to the vortex
swarming as a function of the swarm size is investigated. Eventually, some
evidence of avoidance behavior in \textit{Daphnia} is provided by comparing
experimental and simulation results for two animals.

  for the Frequency of Horizontal Gene Transfer",,,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  The current picture of bacterial evolution is based largely on studies of 16S
rRNA. However, this is just one gene. It is known that horizontal gene transfer
can occur between bacterial species, although the frequency and implications of
this are not fully understood. If horizontal transfer were frequent, there
would be no single evolutionary tree for bacteria because each gene would
follow a different tree. We carried out phylogenetic analyses of rRNA and tRNA
genes from Proteobacteria (a diverse group for which many complete genome
sequences are available) using RNA-specific phylogenetic methods that account
for the conservation of the secondary structure. We compared trees for 16S rRNA
and 23S rRNA with those derived from concatenated alignments of 29 tRNA genes
that are found in all the genomes studied. The tRNA genes are scattered
throughout the genomes, and would not follow the same evolutionary history if
horizontal transfer were frequent. Nevertheless, the tRNA tree is consistent
with the rRNA tree in most respects. Minor differences can almost all be
attributed to uncertainty or unreliability of the phylogenetic method. We
therefore conclude that tRNA genes give a coherent picture of the phylogeny of
the organisms, and that horizontal transfer of tRNAs is too rare to obscure the
signal of the organismal tree. Some tRNA genes are not present in all the
genomes. We discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns of presence
and absence of genes: these involve gene deletion, gene duplication, and
mutations in the tRNA anticodons.

phylogenetic inference because it affects the likelihood calculation. In the
present study we use the complete set of tRNA and rRNA sequences from 69
complete mammalian mitochondrial genomes. The likelihood calculation uses two
evolutionary models simultaneously for different parts of the sequence: a
paired-site model for the paired sites and a single-site model for the unpaired
sites. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods and a Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm is used to obtain the most probable trees and posterior probabilities
of clades. The results are well resolved for almost all the important branches
on the mammalian tree. They support the arrangement of mammalian orders within
the four supra-ordinal clades that have been identified by studies of much
larger data sets mainly comprising nuclear genes. Groups such as the hedgehogs
and the murid rodents, which have been problematic in previous studies with
mitochondrial proteins, appear in their expected position with the other
members of their order. Our choice of genes and evolutionary model appears to
be more reliable and less subject to biases caused by variation in base
composition than previous studies with mitochondrial genomes.
