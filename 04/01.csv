reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM). One of the major
outstanding questions is how this event proceeds on large scales. Motivated by
numerical simulations, we develop a model for the growth of HII regions during
the reionization era. We associate ionized regions with large-scale density
fluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size
distribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of
ionized regions. We show how to construct the power spectrum of fluctuations in
the neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from
the HII regions that should be observable with the next generation of
low-frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission
from the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions
beyond the power spectrum and show that our model of reionization qualitatively
changes the distribution of neutral gas in the IGM.

"astro-ph/0403709","Sharon Toolan","B. C. Whitmore","Survival Rates and Consequences","8 pages, 3 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  To first order, the initial cluster luminosity function appears to be
universal. This means that the brightest young cluster in a galaxy can be
predicted from the total number of young clusters based purely on statistics.
This suggests that the physical processes responsible for the formation of
clusters are similar in a wide variety of galaxies, from mergers to quiescent
spirals. One possibility is that conditions for making young massive clusters
are globally present in mergers while only locally present in spirals (i.e., in
the spiral arms). However, understanding the destruction of clusters and the
accompanying survival rates is more important for understanding cluster
demographics than understanding their formation. This is because only about 1
in 1,000 clusters with mass greater than 10^4 M_odot will survive to become an
old globular cluster. In this paper we briefly review this basic framework and
then develop a toy model that allows us to begin to address several fundamental
questions. In particular, we demonstrate that young clusters in the Antennae
Galaxies have a high ``infant mortality'' rate, with roughly 90% of the
clusters being destroyed each decade of log(time). We also advocate the use of
an objective classification system for clusters, with the three parameters
being mass, age, and size.

Vega from 0.17-1.01 microns on the HST White Dwarf flux scale. These data are
saturated by up to a factor of 80 overexposure but retain linearity to a
precision of 0.2%, because the charge bleeds along the columns and is recovered
during readout of the CCD. The S/N per pixel exceeds 1000, and the resolution R
is about 500. A V magnitude of 0.026 +/- 0.008 is established for Vega; and the
absolute flux level is 3.46 x 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} at 5556 A. In the
regions of Balmer and Paschen lines, the STIS equivalent widths differ from the
pioneering work of Hayes in 1985 but do agree with predictions of a Kurucz
model atmosphere, so that the STIS flux distribution is preferred to that of
Hayes. Over the full wavelength range, the model atmosphere calculation shows
excellent agreement with the STIS flux distribution and is used to extrapolate
predicted fluxes into the IR region. However, the IR fluxes are 2% low with
respect to the standard Vega model of Cohen. IUE data provide the extension of
the measured STIS flux distribution from 0.17 down to 0.12 microns. The STIS
relative flux calibration is based on model atmosphere calculations of pure
hydrogen WDs, while the Hayes flux calibration is based on the physics of
laboratory lamps and black body ovens. The agreement to 1% of these two
independent methods for determining the relative stellar flux distributions
suggests that both methods may be correct from 0.5-0.8 microns and adds
confidence to claims that the fluxes relative to 5500 A are determined to
better than 4% by the pure hydrogen WD models from 0.12 to 3 microns.

activity within rare massive hosts, or by short-lived activity within smaller,
more common hosts. It has been argued that quasar lifetimes may therefore be
inferred from their clustering length, which determines the typical mass of the
quasar host. Here we point out that the relationship between the mass of the
black-hole and the circular velocity of its host dark-matter halo is more
fundamental to the determination of the clustering length. In particular, the
clustering length observed in the 2dF quasar redshift survey is consistent with
the galactic halo - black-hole relation observed in local galaxies, provided
that quasars shine at ~10-100% of their Eddington luminosity. The slow
evolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2dF quasar
survey favors a black-hole mass whose redshift-independent scaling is with halo
circular velocity, rather than halo mass. These results are independent from
observations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used to
determine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift. We show that if
quasar activity results from galaxy mergers, then the number counts of quasars
imply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the host
galaxy rather than by the Salpeter time. Our results imply that as the redshift
increases, the central black-holes comprise a larger fraction of their host
galaxy mass and the quasar lifetime gets shorter.

and a method for quantifying fine structure in dust clouds in the direction of
differentially-reddened globular clusters. We apply these methods to the low-
latitude globular cluster NGC4833 which displays variable extinction/reddening
about a mean <A_V> ~ 1. A set of Monte Carlo simulations is used to
characterize the efficacy of the methods. The essence of the first 2 methods is
to determine, for an assumed value of R_V, the relative visual extinction
delta(A_V) of each cluster horizontal branch (HB) star with respect to an
empirical HB locus; the locus is derived from the CMD of a subset of stars near
the cluster center in which differential reddening is small. A star-by-star
comparison of delta(A_V) from the (B-V,V) CMD with that from the (V-I,V) CMD is
used to find the optimal R_V. In the third method, R_V is determined by
minimizing the scatter in the HB in the (B-V, V) CMD after correcting the
photometry for extinction and reddening using the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust
maps. The weighted average of the results from 3 methods gives R_V = 3.0 +/-
0.4 for the dust towards NGC4833. The dust fine structure is quantified via the
difference, Delta(A_V)_ij = [delta(A_V)]_i - [delta(A_V)]_j, between pairs of
cluster HB stars (i,j) as a function of their angular separation r_ij. The
variance of Delta(A_V)_ij is found to have a power- law dependence on angular
scale: var(r) \propto r^(+0.9 +/- 0.1). This translates into an angular power
spectrum P(kappa) \propto kappa^(-1.9 +/- 0.1) for r ~ 1' - 5', where kappa =
1/r. The dust angular power spectrum on small scales (from optical data)
matches smoothly onto the larger-scale power spectrum derived from Schlegel et
al.'s far-infrared map of the dust thermal emission.

for the nebula to develop is consistent with the light travel time, indicating
that we are observing light from the central source scattered by the ambient
cloud into the line of sight. We also show recent FLWO optical spectroscopy of
the exciting source and of the nearby HH 22. The spectrum of the source is
highly reddened; in contrast, the spectrum of HH 22 shows a shock spectrum
superimposed on a continuum, most likely due to reflected light from the
exciting source reaching the HH object through a much less reddened path. The
blue portion of this spectrum is consistent with an early B spectral type,
similar to the early outburst spectrum of the FU Ori variable V1057 Cyg; we
estimate a luminosity of L ~219 Lsun. The eruptive behavior of the McNeil

particular, assumptions on mass models are crucial in studying flux ratio
anomalies that have been suggested as evidence for a cold dark-matter

Fourier models, which have advantages of clear physical meanings and the
applicability of a linear method, as well as a simple singular isothermal
elliptical density model. We also investigated the effect of external
perturbations, including a singular isothermal sphere, lowest-order expansion,

primary galaxy and/or of external perturbation significantly reduce the \chi^2

of B1422+231 with next-order external perturbation assuming 5% flux

simple singular isothermal sphere approximation. On the other hand, we could
not fit B0712+472 and B2045+265 very well even with our models, although the

pre-selected with multi-filter photometry in a field of 0.36 sqdeg. For 23 of
these objects, spanning a mass range from 0.03 to 0.7 MS, we detect periodic
variability. Of these, 16 exhibit low-level variability, with amplitudes of
less than 0.2 mag in the I-band, which is mostly well-approximated by a sine
wave. These periodicities are probably caused by photospheric spots co-rotating
with the objects. In contrast, the remaining variable targets show high-level
variability with amplitudes ranging from 0.25 to 1.1 mag, consisting of a
periodic light variation onto which short-term fluctuations are superimposed.
This variability pattern is very similar to the photometric behaviour of
solar-mass, classical T Tauri stars. Low-resolution spectra of a few of these
objects reveal strong Halpha and Ca-triplet emission, indicative of ongoing
accretion processes. This suggests that 5-7% of our targets still possess a
circumstellar disk. In combination with previous results for younger objects,
this translates into a disk lifetime of 3-4 Myr, significantly shorter than for
solar mass stars. The highly variable objects rotate on average slower than the
low-amplitude variables, which is expected in terms of a disk-locking scenario.
There is a trend towards faster rotation with decreasing mass, which might be
caused by shortening of the disk lifetimes or attenuation of magnetic fields.

galaxies. We find that more massive simulated clusters have a larger fraction
of stars in the diffuse light than the less massive ones. The intracluster
light is more centrally concentrated than the galaxy light, and the stars in
the diffuse component are on average older than the stars in cluster galaxies,
supporting the view that the diffuse light is not a random sampling of the
stellar population in the cluster galaxies. We thus expect that at least ~10%

We also give a procedure of fitting all parameters to empirical data. We
present a new approach to account for the effective length of power-law memory

asymmetry in returns. We incorporate two related stylized facts, skewness and
leverage autocorrelations into the model. Then from Monte Carlo measurements we

threshold voltage has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, with a
well-defined minimum, and a slope of about 0.12 V/degree near room temperature.
Motivated by this observation, we have designed an experiment in which a weak
continuous-wave absorbed laser beam with a diameter comparable to the pattern
wavelength generates a locally supercritical region, or pulse, in dye-doped
MBBA. Working 10-20% below the laser-free threshold voltage, we observe a
steady-state pulse shaped as an ellipse with the semimajor axis oriented
parallel to the nematic director, with a typical size of several wavelengths.
The pulse is robust, persisting even when spatially extended rolls develop in
the surrounding region, and displays rolls that counterpropagate along the
director at frequencies of tenths of Hz, with the rolls on the left (right)
side of the ellipse moving to the right (left). Systematic measurements of the
sample-voltage dependence of the pulse amplitude, spatial extent, and frequency
show a saturation or decrease when the control parameter (evaluated at the
center of the pulse) approaches ~ 0.3. We propose that the model for these
pulses should be based on the theory of control-parameter ramps, supplemented
with new terms to account for the advection of heat away from the pulse when
the surrounding state becomes linearly unstable. The advection creates a
negative feedback between the pulse size and the efficiency of heat transport,
which we argue is responsible for the attenuation of the pulse at larger
control-parameter values.

the small band gap in FeSi is closed for $x \geq 0.3$, because of both
substitutional disorder and increased volume. Ferromagnetism appears near this
composition and becomes enforced for increasing $x$. The $x$-dependence of the
electronic specific heat can be understood from the exchange splitting of the
density-of-states near the gap. Strong volume dependencies for the properties
of FeGe suggest experiments using pressure instead of $x$ for investigations of
the gap.

matrices are nearly equal for all quarks and leptons. They have very small
determinants and hierarchical form with expansion parameter lambda = 0.26. The
latter can be realized, e.g., in the model with U(1) family symmetry. The
symmetry is broken at the lambda^2 level. Large lepton mixing appears as a
result of summation of the neutrino and charged lepton rotations which
diagonalize the mass matrices in contrast with quark sector where the up quarks
and down quarks rotations cancel each other. We show that the flip of the sign
of rotation in the lepton sector is a result of the seesaw mechanism which also
enhances the neutrino mixing. In this approach one expects, in general,
deviation of the 2-3 mixing from maximal, s_{13} \sim (1-3) lambda^2,

strong retardation effects present in the ghost sector, this fact implies that
no observable modification of the gravitational field of nearby objects occurs.

around the de Rham complex. A leading and motivating problem is to find a
conformally invariant replacement for the usual de Rham harmonics. An obviously
related problem is to find, for each order of differential form bundle, a
``gauge'' operator which completes the exterior derivative to a system which is
both elliptically coercive and conformally invariant. Treating these issues
involves constructing a family of new operators which, on the one hand,
generalise Branson's celebrated Q-curvature and, on the other hand, compose
with the exterior derivative and its formal adjoint to give operators on
differential forms which generalise the critical conformal power of the
Laplacian of Graham-Jenne-Mason-Sparling. We prove here that, like the critical
conformal Laplacians, these conformally invariant operators are not strongly
invariant. The construction draws heavily on the ambient metric of
Fefferman-Graham and its relationship to the conformal tractor connection and
exploring this relationship will be a central theme of the lectures.

  Equation, Named IN-DNLS","22 pages, 18 figures, revtex4, xmgr",,,,"nlin.PS cond-mat.other",,"  IN-DNLS, considered here is a countable infinite set of coupled one
dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential difference equations with a tunable
nonlinearity parameter, $\nu$. This equation is continuous in time and discrete
in space with lattice translational invariance and has global gauge invariance.
When $\nu = 0$, it reduces to the famous integrable Ablowitz - Ladik (AL)
equation. Otherwise it is nonintegrable. The formation of unstaggered and
staggered stationary localized states (SLS) in IN-DNLS is studied here using
discrete variational method. The appropriate functional is derived and its
equivalence to the effective Lagrangian is established. From the physical
consideration, the ansatz of SLS is assumed to have the functional form of
stationary soliton of AL equation. So, the ansatz contains three optimizable
parameters, defining width ($\beta^{-1})$, maximum amplitude and its position
($\sqrt\Psi$, $x_{0}$). Four possible situations are considered. An unstaggered
SLS can be either on-site peaked $(x_{0} = 0.0)$ or inter-site peaked $(x_{0} =
0.5)$. On the other hand, a staggered SLS can be either Sievers-Takeno (ST)
like mode $(x_{0} = 0.0)$, or Page(P) like mode $(x_{0} = 0.5)$. It is shown
here that unstable SLS arises due to incomplete consideration of the problem.
In the exact calculation, there exists no unstable mode. The width of an
unstaggered SLS of either type decreases with increasing $\nu > 0$.
Furthermore, on-site peaked state is found to be energetically stable. These
results are explained using the effective mass picture. For the staggered SLS,
the existence of ST like mode and P like mode is shown to be a fundamental
property of a system, described by IN-DNLS. Their properties are also
investigated. For large width and small amplitude SLS, the known asymptotic
result for the amplitude is obtained. Further scope and possible extensions of
this work are discussed.

is a fascinating topic not only because it represents typical nonlinear
dynamical systems in classical mechanics, but also finds important applications
in a variety of physical problems in different disciplines. Making use of the

equations to many interesting nonlinear evolution equations, including soliton
possessing nonlinear dynamical systems. Typical examples include dynamics of
filament vortices in ordinary and superfluids, spin systems, phases in
classical optics, various systems encountered in physics of soft matter, etc.
Such interrelations between geometric evolution and physical systems have
yielded considerable insight into the underlying dynamics. We present a
succinct tutorial analysis of these developments in this article, and indicate
further directions. We also point out how evolution equations for moving
surfaces are often intimately related to soliton equations in higher

filamentary structures of a skeletal form in electric discharges. A hypothesis
for the contribution of nanotubular dust to initiation of tornadoes is
suggested, in which a key role is delivered to ability of the hypothetical
skeleton inside the thundercloud to provide fast long-range transport of
electricity. Thus, initiation of tornado is suggested to be an electrostatic
instability caused exclusively by the presence and special structuring of a
nanodust.

kind of nodes. This is the case of metabolic networks where the first network
has chemical compounds as nodes and the second one has nodes as reactions. The
second network can be related to the first one by a technique called line graph
transformation (i.e., edges in an initial network are transformed into nodes).
Recently, the main topological properties of the metabolic networks have been
properly described by means of a hierarchical model. In our work, we apply the
line graph transformation to a hierarchical network and the clustering
coefficient $C(k)$ is calculated for the transformed network, where $k$ is the
node degree. While $C(k)$ follows the scaling law $C(k)\sim k^{-1.1}$ for the
initial hierarchical network, $C(k)$ scales weakly as $k^{0.08}$ for the
transformed network. These results indicate that the reaction network can be
identified as a degree-independent clustering network.

cerebral cortices posses many common features and regularities. These
regularities have been a subject of experimental investigation in neuroanatomy
for the last 100 years. It is believed that such studies may provide clues
about cortical design principles and perhaps function. However, on a
theoretical side there has been little interest, until recently, in studying
quantitatively these regularities. This article reviews some attempts in this
direction with an emphasis on neuronal connectivity. It is suggested that the
brain development is influenced by different, conflicting in outcome,
functional/biochemical constraints. Because of these conflicting constraints,
it is hypothesized that the architecture of the cerebral cortex is shaped by
some global optimization plan.

quantum-classical hybrid with dynamically coupled quantum and classical degrees
of freedom. We show that, even in the absence of any other interaction with
environment, the interaction of the purely quantum atom-field system with the
external atomic degree of freedom provides the emergence of classical dynamical
chaos from quantum electrodynamics. Atomic fractals with self-similar
intermittency of smooth and unresolved structures are found in the exit-time
scattering function. Tiny interplay between all the degrees of freedom is
responsible for dynamical trapping of atoms even in a very short microcavity.
Gedanken experiments are proposed to detect manifestations of atomic fractals
in cavity quantum electrodynamics.

computation, cryptography, communications, digital signal processing, and the
emerging field of quantum computation. Furthermore, prototype circuits for
low-power applications are already being fabricated in CMOS. Regardless of the
eventual technology adopted, testing is sure to be an important component in
any robust implementation.
  We consider the test set generation problem. Reversibility affects the
testing problem in fundamental ways, making it significantly simpler than for
the irreversible case. For example, we show that any test set that detects all
single stuck-at faults in a reversible circuit also detects all multiple
stuck-at faults. We present efficient test set constructions for the standard
stuck-at fault model as well as the usually intractable cell-fault model. We
also give a practical test set generation algorithm, based on an integer linear
programming formulation, that yields test sets approximately half the size of
those produced by conventional ATPG.

infinitesimal correlation are highlighted simultaneously and can be used
constructively for qubit manipulation. For example, it allows to compute
explicitly a Rodrigues' formula for the one-parameter orbits of nonlocal
Hamiltonians. The result is easily generalizable to orbits of Cartan
subalgebras and allows to write the Cartan decomposition of unitary propagators
as a linear action.
