Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. WMAP has sufficiently broad frequency coverage
to constrain SZ without the addition of higher frequency data: the SZ power
spectrum amplitude is expected to increase 50% from W to Q frequency band.
This, in combination with the low noise in WMAP, allows us to strongly
constrain the SZ contribution. We derive an optimal frequency combination of
WMAP cross-spectra to extract SZ in the presence of noise, CMB, and radio point
sources, which are marginalized over. We find that the SZ contribution is less
than 2% (95% c.l.) at the first acoustic peak in W band. Under the assumption
that the removed radio point sources are not correlated with SZ this limit
implies sigma_8<1.07 at 95% c.l. We investigate the effect on the cosmological
parameters of allowing an SZ component. We run Monte Carlo Markov Chains with
and without an SZ component and find that the addition of SZ does not affect
any of the cosmological conclusions. We conclude that SZ does not contaminate
the WMAP CMB or change cosmological parameters, refuting the recent claims that
they may be corrupted.

five years, at least six are in the so-called Kozai resonance. Due to solar
perturbations, the argument of pericenter of a satellite usually precesses from
0 to 360 degrees. However, at inclinations higher than 39.3 degrees and lower
than 140.7 degrees a new kind of behavior occurs for which the argument of
pericenter oscillates around +/-90 degrees. In this work we will concentrate on
the orbital history of the saturnian satellite S/2000 S5 Kiviuq, one of the
satellites currently known to be in such resonance Kiviuq's orbit is very close
to the separatrix of the Kozai resonance. Due to perturbations from the other
jovian planets, it is expected that orbits near the Kozai separatrix may show
significant chaotic behavior. This is important because chaotic diffusion may
transfer orbits from libration to circulation, and vice versa. To identify
chaotic orbits we used two well-known methods: the Frequency Analysis Method
(Laskar 1990) and Maximum Lyapunov Exponents (Benettin et al. 1980). Our
results show that the Kozai resonance is crossed by a web of secondary
resonances, whose arguments involve combinations of the argument of pericenter,
the argument of the Great Inequality, longitude of the node, and other terms
related to the secular frequencies g5, g6, and s6. Many test orbits whose
precession period is close to the period of the Great Inequality (883 yrs), or
some of its harmonics, are trapped by these secondary resonances, and show
significant chaotic behavior. Planetary migration, by moving the locations of
these secondary resonances, may have depleted an original population of Kozai
resonators.

dusty astrophysical environment investigated. The UIB carrier must be abundant
and ubiquitous. Strong evidence points to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) as likely candidates, but the identification is not complete. Additional
diagnostics are needed to further constrain the UIB carrier, such as probing
excitation sources which range from UV-strong to UV-weak, in order to determine
the ``band gap'' of the UIB carrier. Observations and models suggest that the
UIBs can be found in sources with weak UV fields. To that end, we present new
results of observing the 3.3 micron spectral region in six stars embedded in
reflection nebulae, and in six Vega-like stars. These objects have effective
temperatures ranging from 3500 to 12,000 K. Their environments include dust
that should be relatively unprocessed (reflection nebulae) and dust that has
most likely undergone significant processing (Vega-like) by the embedded
illumination source. Together with data from the literature, we have a sample
of 27 sightlines. Our analysis suggests that neither the strength of the UV
field impinging on the dust nor the effective temperature of the star is the
determining factor in whether the 3.3 micron UIB emission is present in an
object. We found three detections of the 3.3 micron-emission band, one in a
Vega-type object, one in a Herbig Ae/Be object and one in a reflection nebula,

revealing or obscuring the photo-dissociation regions from which the UIB

power-law continuum with a slope of 1.6 at high energies absorbed by at least
two warm absorbers (WAs) intrinsic to the source. The underlying continuum in
the earlier observation shows a soft excess at low X-ray energies which can be
modeled as an additional power-law with a slope of 2.9. The high-resolution
grating spectrum obtained in 2002 shows emission lines from N VI, O VII, O
VIII, Ne IX, and Ne X, as well as absorption lines from the low-ionization ions
of O III, O IV, and O V, and other confirmed and suspected weaker absorption
lines. We suggest a model for the high-resolution spectrum which consist of two
or three WA components. The two-components model has a high-ionization WA with
a column density of 10^21.5 - 10^21.8 cm^-2 and a low-ionization absorber with
a column density of 10^20.3 cm^-2. In the three-components model we add a lower
ionization component that produce the observed iron M-shell absorption lines.
We investigate the spectral variations in MR2251-178 over a period of 8.5 years
using data from ASCA, BeppoSAX, and XMM-Newton. All X-ray observations can be
fitted with the above EPIC-pn model. The 8.5 year history of the source

of observed pulses fluctuates with time. The theory relating the observed pulse
time-shapes to the electron-density correlation function has developed for 30
years, however, two puzzles have remained. First, observational scaling of
pulse broadening with the pulsar distance is anomalously strong; it is
consistent with the standard model only when non-uniform statistics of electron
fluctuations along the line of sight are assumed. Second, the observed pulse
shapes are consistent with the standard model only when the scattering material
is concentrated in a narrow slab between the pulsar and the Earth.
  We propose that both paradoxes are resolved at once if one assumes stationary
and uniform, but non-Gaussian statistics of the electron-density distribution.
Such statistics must be of Levy type, and the propagating ray should exhibit a
Levy flight. We propose that a natural realization of such statistics may be
provided by the interstellar medium with random electron-density
discontinuities. We develop a theory of wave propagation in such a non-Gaussian
random medium, and demonstrate its good agreement with observations. The
qualitative introduction of the approach and the resolution of the
anomalous-scaling paradox was presented earlier in [PRL 91, 131101 (2003); ApJ

eccentric ring is presented.We view an eccentric ring which precesses uniformly
at a slow rate as exhibiting a global $m=1$ mode originating from a standing
wave superposed on an axisymmetric background.We adopt a continuum description
using the language of fluid dynamics which gives equivalent results for the
secular dynamics of thin rings as the the well known description using discrete
elliptical streamlines formulated by Goldreich and Tremaine (1979). We use this
to discuss the non linear mode interactions that appear through the excitation
of higher $m$ modes due to the coupling of the $m=1$ mode with an external
satellite potential, showing that they can lead to the excitation of the $m=1$
mode through a feedback process.Two conditions for the maintainance of a steady
$m=1$ mode are obtained. One,being the condition for the normal mode pattern to
precess uniformly requires a balance between the differential precession
induced by the oblateness of the central planet,self-gravity and collisional
effects and is the continuum form of that obtained from the $N$ streamline
model of Goldreich and Tremaine (1979).The other condition is for the steady
maintenance of the non-zero radial action of the ring on account of the normal
mode.This requires a balance between input due to eccentric resonances due to
external satellites and additional collisional damping associated with the
presence of the $m=1$ mode We estimate that such a balance can occur in the
$\epsilon-$ring of Uranus,given its currently observed physical and orbital
parameters.

drops in the vicinity of a field-induced zero-temperature quantum phase

conductance behavior of the SCD structure has new and richer physics than the
better studied system of two dots aligned with the leads (ACD). In the weak
coupling regime and in the case of one electron per dot, the ACD configuration
gives rise to two mostly independent Kondo states. In the SCD topology, the
inserted dot is in a Kondo state while the side-connected one presents Coulomb
blockade properties. Moreover, the dot spins change their behavior, from an
antiferromagnetic coupling to a ferromagnetic correlation, as a consequence of
the interaction with the conduction electrons. The system is governed by the
Kondo effect related to the dot that is embedded into the leads. The role of
the side-connected dot is to introduce, when at resonance, a new path for the
electrons to go through giving rise to the interferences responsible for the
suppression of the conductance. These results depend on the values of the
intra-dot Coulomb interactions. In the case where the many-body interaction is
restricted to the side-connected dot, its Kondo correlation is responsible for
the scattering of the conduction electrons giving rise to the conductance
suppression.

Kohn-Sham states we show that vortices enter the quantum dot one-by-one at the
transition to the state with the adjacent magic angular momentum. Vortices are
also observed outside the high-density region of the quantum dot. These
findings are compared to the ED results and we report a significant agreement.
We study also interpretations and limitations of the density functional
approach in these calculations.

crystals possessing different TB densities were studied. The SANS experiments
show that the TB strongly modify the structure of the FLL. The flux lines
meander as soon as the magnetic field makes an angle with the TB direction.
According to the value of this angle but also to the ratio of the flux lines
density over the TB density, one observes that the FLL exhibits two different
unit cells in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. One is the
classical hexagonal and anisotropic cell while the other is affected by an
additional deformation induced by the TB. We discuss a possible relation

method for quantum spin systems by studying one and two dimensional model
cases. Our approach consists of two steps: (i) building an effective

solving this new model numerically on finite clusters by exact diagonalization.
This approach, giving complementary information to analytical treatments of the
CORE Hamiltonian, can be used as a semi-quantitative numerical method. For
ladder type geometries, we explicitely check the accuracy of the effective
models by increasing the range of the effective interactions. In two dimensions
we consider the plaquette lattice and the kagome lattice as non-trivial test
cases for the numerical CORE method. On the plaquette lattice we have an
excellent description of the system in both the disordered and the ordered
phases, thereby showing that the CORE method is able to resolve quantum phase
transitions. On the kagome lattice we find that the previously proposed twofold
degenerate S=1/2 basis can account for a large number of phenomena of the spin
1/2 kagome system. For spin 3/2 however this basis does not seem to be
sufficient anymore. In general we are able to simulate system sizes which
correspond to an 8x8 lattice for the plaquette lattice or a 48-site kagome
lattice, which are beyond the possibilities of a standard exact diagonalization
approach.

even lapse. Favorable boundary conditions are then derived which make the
overall slice stretching occur late in numerical simulations. Allowing the
lapse to become negative, this requirement leads to lapse functions which
approach at late times the odd lapse corresponding to the static Schwarzschild
metric. Demanding in addition that a numerically favorable lapse remains
non-negative, as result the average of odd and even lapse is obtained. At late
times the lapse with zero gradient at the puncture arising for the puncture
evolution is precisely of this form. Finally, analytic arguments are given on
how slice stretching effects can be avoided. Here the excision technique and

reformulation of special relativistic physics in a form taking into account the
non-dynamical chrono-geometrical structure of Minkowski space-time
(parametrized Minkowski theories and rest-frame instant form) and in particular
the conventionality of simultaneity (re-phrased as a gauge freedom), a model of
canonical metric and tetrad gravity is proposed in a class of space-times where
the deparametrization to Minkowski space-time is possible. In them it is
possible to give a post-Minkowskian background-independent description of the
gravitational field and of matter. The study of the dynamical
chrono-geometrical structure of these space-times allows to face
interpretational problems like the physical identification of point-events (the
Hole Argument), the distinction between inertial (gauge) and tidal (Dirac
observables) effects, the dynamical nature of simultaneity in general
relativity and to find background-independent gravitational waves. These
developments are possible at the Hamiltonian level due to a systematic use of
Dirac-Bergmann theory of constraints. Finally there is a proposal for a new
coordinate- and background-independent quantization scheme for gravity.

dimension-5 operators that can induce proton decay at dangerous rates, even

the same physics that explains the fermion masses and mixings. We present a
thorough analysis of nucleon partial lifetimes in models with a string-inspired
anomalous U(1)_X family symmetry which is responsible for the fermionic mass
spectrum as well as forbidding R-parity violating interactions. Protons and
neutrons can decay via R-parity conserving non-renormalizable superpotential
terms that are suppressed by the Planck scale and powers of the Cabibbo angle.
Many of the models naturally lead to nucleon decay near present limits without
any reference to grand unification.

I, Type II or Heterotic strings. Chirality is obtained by turning on constant
magnetic fluxes in each of the 2-tori. Our results are general and may as well
be applied to lower D=6,8 dimensional field theories. We solve Dirac and
Laplace equations to find out the explicit form of wavefunctions in extra

Yukawa couplings so obtained are described by Riemann theta-functions, which
depend on the complex structure and Wilson line backgrounds. Different patterns
of Yukawa textures are possible depending on the values of these backgrounds.

enough to prevent the universe from exceeding this limiting temperature. The

just reaches the horizon of the black hole, and that entropy bounds and the
generalized second law of thermodynamics seem to be violated when the brane
continues to fall into the black hole. We find, again, that the known physical

from many supersymmetric spaces which naively suffer from this problem. The
main claim is that supertubes naturally form domain-walls, so while analytical
continuation of the metric would lead to closed time-like curves, across the
domain-wall the metric is non-differentiable, and the closed time-like curves
are eliminated. In the examples we study the metric inside the domain-wall is
always of the G\""odel type, while outside the shell it looks like a localized
rotating object, often a rotating black hole. Thus this mechanism prevents the
appearance of closed time-like curves behind the horizons of certain rotating
black holes.

forcing stabilized a pattern of concentric rolls (a target pattern) with the
central roll (the umbilicus) at the center of the cell after a jump from the
conduction to the convection state. A quasi-static increase of the control
parameter (epsilon) beyond 0.8 caused the umbilicus of the pattern to move off
center. As observed by others, a further quasi-static increase of epsilon up to
15.6 caused a sequence of transitions. Each transition began with the
displacement of the umbilicus and then proceeded with the loss of one
convection roll at the umbilicus and the return of the umbilicus to a location
near the center of the cell. Alternatively, with decreasing epsilon new rolls
formed at the umbilicus but large umbilicus displacements did not occur. In
addition to quantitative measurements of the umbilicus displacement, we
determined and analyzed the entire wave-director field of each image. The wave
numbers varied in the axial direction, with minima at the umbilicus and at the
cell wall and a maximum at a radial position close to 2/3 Gamma. The wave
numbers at the maximum showed hysteretic jumps at the transitions, but on

Game Theory, including static classical game and static quantum game. The idea
is to find a set of base vectors in every single-player strategy space and to
define their inner product so as to form them as a Hilbert space, and then form
a Hilbert space of system state. Basic ideas, concepts and formulas in Game
Theory have been reexpressed in such a space of system state. This space
provides more possible strategies than traditional classical game and
traditional quantum game. So besides those two games, more games have been
defined in different strategy spaces. All the games have been unified in the
new representation and their relation has been discussed. General Nash
Equilibrium for all the games has been proposed but without a general proof of
the existence. Besides the theoretical description, ideas and technics from
Statistical Physics, such as Kinetics Equation and Thermal Equilibrium can be
easily incorporated into Game Theory through such a representation. This
incorporation gives an endogenous method for refinement of Equilibrium State
and some hits to simplify the calculation of Equilibrium State. The more
privileges of this new representation depends on further application on more
theoretical and real games. Here, almost all ideas and conclusions are shown by
examples and argument, while, we wish, lately, we can give mathematical proof

subsystems with nearest neighbor interactions and assume that the total system
is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyze under what condition
the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices with respect to
groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the same temperature
$T$. While in classical mechanics the validity of this procedure only depends
on the size of the groups $n$, in quantum mechanics the minimum group size
$n_{min}$ also depends on the temperature $T $! As examples, we apply our
analysis to a harmonic chain and different types of Ising spin chains. We
discuss various features that show up due to the characteristics of the models
considered. For the harmonic chain, which successfully describes thermal
properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first quantitative
estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can exist: This
length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the Debye
temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below.

observables. Generalized URs are known which contain three or more dispersions.
They are derived here starting with suitable generalized Cauchy inequalities.
It is shown what new information the generalized URs provide. Similar
interpretation is given to generalized Cauchy inequalities.

  clarification",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Physical path integral formulation of motion of particles in Riemannian
spaces is outlined and extended to deduce the corresponding field theoretical
formulation. For the special case of a zero rest mass particle in Minkowski
manifold, it is shown that the underlying space can be reduced to
three-dimensional while similar formulation for a massive particle requires a
four-dimensional structure. The solutions obtained by the present procedure are
compared with the results obtained from its counterpart for a massive particle
by setting the mass equal to zero. Although similar, the present formulation
has some additional implications pertaining to the energy spectrum and the
associated free field quantization, particularly it yields zero vacuum energy.
The results are naturally extended to higher dimensions.

classical integrability is proposed: A system is quantum-integrable if it has
an abelian Lie group of Wigner symmetries of dimension equal to the number of
degrees of freedom. The criterion goes significantly beyond the familiar case
of involutive conserved operators to cover systems with anomalies in which
involutivity is modified by central charges. ""Anomalous"" quantum integrability
is shown to have all the expected consequences including exact
diagonalisability. The approach throws new light on the origin of Weyl group
invariance.
