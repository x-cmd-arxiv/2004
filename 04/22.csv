large telescope (ELT). Given the likely observational capabilities of an ELT
and current knowledge of the stellar environment at the Galactic center, we
synthesize plausible samples of stellar orbits around the black hole. We use
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to evaluate the constraints that orbital
monitoring places on the matter content near the black hole. Results are
expressed as functions of the number N of stars with detectable orbital motions
and the astrometric precision dtheta and spectroscopic precision dv at which
stellar proper motions and radial velocities are monitored. For N = 100, dtheta
= 0.5 mas, and dv = 10 km/s -- a conservative estimate of the capabilities of a
30 meter telescope -- the extended matter distribution enclosed by the orbits
will produce measurable deviations from Keplerian motion if >1000 Msun is
enclosed within 0.01 pc. The black hole mass and distance to the Galactic
center will be measured to better than ~0.1%. Lowest-order relativistic
effects, such as the prograde precession, will be detectable if dtheta < 0.5
mas. Higher-order effects, including frame dragging due to black hole spin,
requires dtheta < 0.05 mas, or the favorable discovery of a compact, highly
eccentric orbit. Finally, we calculate the rate at which monitored stars
undergo detectable nearby encounters with background stars. Such encounters
probe the mass function of stellar remnants that accumulate near the black
hole. We find that ~30 encounters will be detected over a 10 yr baseline for
dtheta = 0.5 mas.

While strong [Fe II] emission, thought to originate in the thermal shocks
associated with supernova remnants, is found throughout the galaxy, both Br
12-4 and Br 14-4 emission, and weak CO(6,3) absorption, is predominantly
associated with the northern starburst region. The Brackett lines originate
from recombination processes occurring on smaller scales in (young) HII
regions. The time-scale associated with strong [Fe II] emission implies that
most of the recent star-formation activity in NGC 1140 was induced in the past
35-55 Myr. Based on the spatial distributions of the [Fe II] versus Brackett
line emission, we conclude that a galaxy-wide starburst was induced several
tens of Myr ago, with more recent starburst activity concentrated around the
northern starburst region. This scenario is (provisionally) confirmed by our
analysis of the spectral energy distributions of the compact, young massive

an age difference between the northern and southern YMC complexes in the sense
expected from our CIRPASS analysis. Our photometric mass estimates of the NGC

kick velocity and spin tilt for both isotropic and polar kicks. Our analysis
takes into account both currently unknown parameters: the orientation of the
orbital plane on the sky (Omega) and the radial component of the systemic
velocity (V_r). Assuming that the system's peculiar velocity is entirely due to
the second supernova explosion, we find that the system may have crossed the
Galactic plane multiple times since the birth of the second neutron star and
that the post-supernova peculiar velocity could have been as high as 1200km/s.
We also confirm the absolute lower and upper limits on the physical parameters
derived in our earlier study. For specific combinations of the two unknown
parameters Omega and V_r, however, we find much tighter constraints on the
pre-supernova binary configuration and natal kicks imparted to pulsar B, as
well as on the age of system. Once Omega is measured in the coming year, it
will be straightforward to use the results presented here to further constrain
the natal kicks and the spin-tilt predictions. We complete our comprehensive
study and derive similar constraints and spin-tilt predictions for PSR

V = 22.2 (Mv = -12.5) lie at projected distances of ~5 kpc from the center and
move with halo-type radial velocities relative to the local galaxy background.
Their spectra show strong Balmer absorption lines indicative of main-sequence
turnoffs dominated by A-type stars. Comparisons with model-cluster spectra
computed by Bruzual & Charlot and others yield cluster ages in the range of
200-530 Myr, and metallicities about solar to within a factor of three. Given
their small half-light radii (Reff < 5 pc) and ages corresponding to ~100 core-
crossing times, these clusters are gravitationally bound and, hence, indeed
young globulars. Assuming that they had Chabrier-type initial mass functions,
their estimated current masses are 2.3(+-0.1)x10^6 Msun and 1.5(+-0.1)x10^6
Msun, respectively, or roughly half the mass of omegaCen. Since NGC 3921 itself
shows many signs of being a 0.7(+-0.3) Gyr old protoelliptical, these two young
globulars of roughly solar metallicity and their many counterparts observed
with the Hubble Space Telescope provide supporting evidence that, in the
process of forming elliptical-like remnants, major mergers of gas-rich disks
can also increase the number of metal-rich globular clusters. (Abridged)

comparisons are not always simple. We demonstrate that the projected
spectroscopic temperature of thermally complex clusters obtained from X-ray
observations is always lower than the emission-weighed temperature, which is
widely used in the analysis of numerical simulations. We show that this
temperature bias is mainly related to the fact that the emission-weighted
temperature does not reflect the actual spectral properties of the observed
source. This has important implications for the study of thermal structures in
clusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, like shock fronts, are
present. Because of this bias, in real observations shock fronts appear much
weaker than what is predicted by emission-weighted temperature maps, and may
even not be detected. This may explain why, although numerical simulations
predict that shock fronts are a quite common feature in clusters of galaxies,
to date there are very few observations of objects in which they are clearly
seen. To fix this problem we propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-like
temperature function, and show that, for temperature larger than 3 keV, it
approximates the spectroscopic temperature better than few per cent, making
simulations more directly comparable to observations.

a mass function of 6.1 Msun which is a lower limit to the mass of the binary
companion of the neutron star. The degree of attenuation of the low-energy end
of the spectrum is found to be a strong function of orbital phase. A simple
model of absorption in a stellar wind from the companion star fits the orbital
phase dependence reasonably well and limits the orbital inclination angle to
the range 38 to 72 degrees. These measured parameters lead to an orbital
separation of 60 to 80 lt-s, a mass for the companion star in the range 9-31

growth of a bar is also accompanied by substantial heating of the disk stars
near the OLR. For the growth of a $10^{10} M_{\rm \odot}$ bar, the radial

photometry show that LBV 1806-20 is similar in many respects to the luminous
``Pistol Star'', albeit with some important differences. They also provide
estimates of the effective temperature and reddening of LBV 1806-20, and
confirm distance estimates, leading to a best estimate for the luminosity of
this star of $> 5 \times 10^6 L_{\odot}$. The nearby cluster stars have
spectral types and inferred absolute magnitudes which confirm the distance (and
thus luminosity) estimate for LBV 1806-20. If we drop kinematic measurements of
the distance ($15.1 ^{+1.8}_{-1.3}$ kpc), we have a lower limit on the distance
of $>9.5$ kpc, and on the luminosity of $>2 \times 10^6 L_{\odot}$, based on
the cluster stars. If we drop both the kinematic and cluster star indicators
for distance, an ammonia absorption feature sets yet another lower limit to the
distance of $>5.7$ kpc, with a corresponding luminosity estimate of $>7 \times
10^5 L_{\odot}$ for the candidate LBV 1806-20. Furthermore, based on very high
angular-resolution speckle images, we determine that LBV 1806-20 is not a
cluster of stars, but is rather a single star or binary system. Simple
arguments based on the Eddington luminosity lead to an estimate of the total
mass of LBV 1806-20 (single or binary) exceeding $190 M_{\odot}$. We discuss
the possible uncertainties in these results, and their implications for the
star formation history of this cluster.

investigate the SEDs of a new sample of high-redshift submillimeter-selected

reliable luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures. We demonstrate that
a wide range of SEDs is present in the population, and that a substantial
number of luminous dusty galaxies with hotter dust temperatures could exist at
similar redshifts (of order 2 to 3), but remain undetected in existing
submillimeter surveys. These hotter galaxies could be responsible for about a
third of the extragalactic IR background radiation at a wavelength of about 100
microns. The brightest of these galaxies would have far-IR luminosities of
order 10 to the 13 solar luminosities and dust temperatures of order 60 K.
Galaxies up to an order of magnitude less luminous with similar SEDs will be

139 in the 14.3 mu band to a limiting sensitivity of ~ 2 mJy. Only about 50% of
the mid-IR excess sources show excesses in the near-IR J-H/H-K diagram. In the
central Cloud Core the Class I/Class II number ratio is 19/18, i.e. about 10
times larger than in other young embedded clusters such as rho Ophiuchi or
Chamaeleon. The mid-IR fluxes of the Class I and flat-spectrum sources are
found to be on the average larger than those of Class II sources. Stellar
luminosities are estimated for the Class II sample, and its luminosity function
is compatible with a coeval population of about 2 Myr which follows a three
segment power-law IMF. For this age about 20% of the Class IIs are found to be
young brown dwarf candidates. The YSOs are in general strongly clustered, the
Class I sources more than the Class II sources, and there is an indication of
sub-clustering. The sub-clustering of the protostar candidates has a spatial
scale of 0.12 pc. These sub-clusters are found along the NW-SE oriented ridge
and in very good agreement with the location of dense cores traced by
millimeter data. The smallest clustering scale for the Class II sources is
about 0.25 pc, similar to what was found for rho Ophiuchi. Our data show

that a ``microburst'' of star formation has taken place very recently, probably

We consider two types of asymmetry: disk-like asymmetry, in which the core is
denser towards the equatorial plane than towards the poles; and axial
asymmetry, in which the core is denser towards the south pole than the north
pole. We limit our treatment to cores with mild asymmetries, which are exposed
directly to the interstellar radiation field or are embedded inside molecular
clouds.
  The isophotal maps of a core depend strongly on the viewing angle. Maps at
wavelengths longer than the peak of the SED (e.g. 850 micron) essentially trace
the column-density. Thus, for instance, cores with disk-like asymmetry appear
elongated when mapped at 850 micron from close to the equatorial plane.
However, at wavelengths near the peak of the SED (e.g. 200 micron), the
emissivity is more strongly dependent on the temperature, and therefore, at
particular viewing angles, there are characteristic features which reflect a
more complicated convolution of the density and temperature fields within the
core.
  These characteristic features are on scales 1/5 to 1/3 of the overall core
size, and so high resolution observations are needed to observe them. They are
also weaker if the core is embedded in a molecular cloud (because the range of
temperature within the core is then smaller), and so high sensitivity is needed
to detect them. Herschel, to be launched in 2007, will in principle provide the
necessary resolution and sensitivity at 170 to 250 micron.

blackbodies with a power-law, with temperatures between kT ~ 100-300 eV. On the
whole, these temperatures are too high to be direct thermal emission from the
accretion disc, so a Comptonization model was used as a more physical
parametrization. The Comptonizing electron population forms the soft excess
emission, with an electron temperature of ~ 120-680 eV. Power-law, thermal

perfect c-oriented YBCO thin films deposited on CeO2-buffered sapphire
substrates. The measurements revealed a distinct two-peak structure of Rs(T)
and Xs(T) dependencies with peaks at 28-30 K and 50 K. The peaks become smeared
at higher frequencies as well as in applied dc magnetic field about 1 kOe,
while the peak positions remain almost unchanged. For less perfect, e.g., PLD
films, Rs(T) and Xs(T) dependencies are monotonous (power law). The two-peak
Zs(T)dependencies for YBCO films differ from those for high quality YBCO single
crystals, where only one much broader frequency-dependent peak of Rs(T) was
detected earlier. The two-peak Zs(T) behavior is believed to be an intrinsic
electron property of extremely perfect quasi-single-crystalline YBCO films. A
theoretical model is suggested to explain the observed anomalous Zs(T)
behavior. The model is based on the Boltzman kinetic equation for
quasiparticles in layered HTS cuprates. It takes into account the supposed
s+d-wave symmetry of electron pairing and strong energy dependent relaxation
time of quasiparticles, determined mainly by their elastic scattering on
extended defects parallel to the c-axis (e.g., c-oriented dislocations and twin

For a bell-shape antidot containing about 300 holes, the features of the

deformation potential of the hole states arising from the C-C bond stretch mode
is 60% larger than the corresponding quantity in MgB2 that drives its high Tc,
leading to very large electron-phonon matrix elements. The calculated coupling
strength \lambda ~ 0.5 leads to T_c in the 5-10 K range and makes phonon
coupling the likely mechanism. Higher doping should increase T_c somewhat, but
effects of three dimensionality primarily on the density of states keep doped
diamond from having a T_c closer to that of MgB2.

first by Verlinde (2000), is extended so as to incorporate the case of a

question some elements in this type of theory, especially the manner in which
the Casimir energy is evaluated. Also, we consider the observation made by Youm

conventional Cardy-Verlinde form if one relaxes the radiation dominance
equation of state for the fluid and instead merely assumes that the pressure is
proportional to the energy density. We show that Youm's generalized entropy
formula remains valid when the cosmic fluid is no longer ideal, but endowed
with a constant bulk viscosity. In the introductory part of this article, we
take a general point of view and survey the essence of cosmological theory

annihilation of polarized photons into the Higgs boson determines its
fundamental two-photon coupling as well as determining its parity. Other novel
two-photon processes include the two-photon production of charged lepton pairs,
vector boson pairs, as well as supersymmetric squark and slepton pairs and
Higgstrahlung. The one-loop box diagram leads to the production of pairs of
neutral particles. High energy photon-photon collisions can also provide a
remarkably background-free laboratory for studying possibly anomalous $W W$
collisions and annihilation. In the case of QCD, each photon can materialize as
a quark anti-quark pair which interact via multiple gluon exchange. The
diffractive channels in photon-photon collisions allow a novel look at the QCD
pomeron and odderon. Odderon exchange can be identified by looking at the heavy
quark asymmetry. In the case of electron-photon collisions, one can measure the

neutrino mass matrices with six vanishing entries or texture zeros. Only 24 of
them, which can be classified into a few distinct categories, are found to be
compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at the $3\sigma$ level. A
peculiar feature of the lepton mass matrices in each category is that they have
the same phenomenological consequences. Taking account of a simple seesaw
scenario for six parallel patterns of the charged lepton and Dirac neutrino
mass matrices with six zeros, we show that it is possible to fit the
experimental data at or below the $2\sigma$ level. In particular, the maximal
atmospheric neutrino mixing can be reconciled with a strong neutrino mass
hierarchy in the seesaw case. Numerical predictions are also obtained for the
neutrino mass spectrum, flavor mixing angles, CP-violating phases and effective
masses of the tritium beta decay and the neutrinoless double beta decay.

precise tests of general relativity, follows straightforwardly. We give a
simple and general proof of stability, i.e. absence of ghosts in the
fluctuations, valid for most of the relevant cases, like for instance the
spherical source in asymptotically flat space. However we confirm that around
certain interesting self-accelerating cosmological solutions there is a ghost.
We consider the issue of quantum corrections. Around flat space \pi becomes
strongly coupled below a macroscopic length of 1000 km, thus impairing the
predictivity of the model. Indeed the tower of higher dimensional operators
which is expected by a generic UV completion of the model limits predictivity
at even larger length scales. We outline a non-generic but consistent choice of
counterterms for which this disaster does not happen and for which the model
remains calculable and successful in all the astrophysical situations of
interest. By this choice, the extrinsic curvature K_{\mu\nu} acts roughly like
a dilaton field controlling the strength of the interaction and the cut-off
scale at each space-time point. At the surface of Earth the cutoff is \sim 1 cm

symplectic manifold $X$ with a compatible complex structure and a Hamiltonian
action of $S^1$ with moment map $\mu:X\to\imag\RR$, the moduli space which we
compactify consists of equivalence classes of tuples $(C,P,A,\phi)$, where $C$
is a smooth compact complex curve of fixed genus, $P$ is a principal $S^1$
bundle over $C$, $A$ is a connection on $P$ and $\phi$ is a section of
$P\times_{S^1}X$ satisfying $$\ov{\partial}_A\phi=0,\qquad

restriction on $C$ of a volume form on the universal curve over $\oM_g$ and $c$
is a fixed constant. Two tuples $(C,P,A,\phi)$ and $(C',P',A',\phi')$ are
equivalent if there is a morphism of bundles $\rho:P\to P'$ lifting a
biholomorphism $C\to C'$ such that $\rho^*A'=A$ and $\rho^*\phi'=\phi$. The
energy of $(C,P,A,\phi)$ is $\|F_A\|_{L^2}^2+\|d_A\phi\|_{L^2}^2

one. We also incorporate marked points in the picture.

analogous to the one in Gromov--Witten theory. Second, degeneration of $C$ to
nodal curves. In this case, there appears a phenomenon which is not present in

circulation of the Mediterranean Sea, as obtained from a primitive equation

the velocity data set, which gives a direct measure of the local stirring. By
proper election of the FSLE parameters, we focus on the mesoscale structures,
locating a number of vortices embedded in an intricate network of
high-stretching lines. These lines control transport in the system. At the edge
of the vortices, a dense tangle of line intersections appears, identifying
strong mixing. The spatial distribution of FSLEs, averaged over one year,
allows to classify areas in the Mediterranean basin according by their mixing
activity. The space average of FSLEs on selected geographical regions gives a
measure for quantifying and comparing the mixing seasonal variability.

in terms of the excitation $H=(H,D)$ and the field strength $F=(E,B)$.
Additionally, a local and linear ``spacetime relation'' is assumed between $H$

propagation is studied of electromagnetic wave fronts (surfaces of
discontinuity) with a method of Hadamard. We find a generalized Fresnel
equation that is quartic in the wave covector of the wave front. We discuss
under which conditions the waves propagate along the light cone. Thereby we
derive the metric of spacetime, up to a conformal factor, by purely
electromagnetic methods.

since the ether defines the very reference frame, in which mechanics is

corresponds to an incompressible ether, a compressible ether leads to
gravitational waves. In the Lorentz-Poincar\'e version, special relativity is
compatible with the ether, but, with the heterogeneous ether of gravity, it
applies only locally. A correspondence between metrical effects of uniform
motion and gravitation is assumed, yet in two possible versions (one is new).

global structure of integer partitions sequences (IPS) is that of a complex
tree. By analyzing the structure of this tree, we derive a closed form
expression for a map from (N, M) to the set of all partitions of a positive
integer N into exactly M positive integer summands without regard to order. The
derivation is based on the use of modular arithmetic to solve an isomorphic
combinatoric problem, that of describing the global organization of the

paradoxical trends will be explained by the complementarity of longevity, which
