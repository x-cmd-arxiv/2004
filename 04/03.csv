cosmic microwave background data collected by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We compare the WMAP temperature statistics of extrema
(number of extrema, mean excursion, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the
excursion) to Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that, on average, the local
maxima (high temperatures in the anisotropy) are too cold and the local minima
are too warm. In order to quantify this claim we describe a two-sided
statistical hypothesis test which we advocate for other investigations of the
Gaussianity hypothesis. Using this test we reject the isotropic Gaussian
hypothesis at more than 99% confidence in a well-defined way. Our claims are
based only on regions that are outside the most conservative WMAP foreground
mask. We perform our test separately on maxima and minima, and on the north and
south ecliptic and Galactic hemispheres and reject Gaussianity at above 95%
confidence for almost all tests of the mean excursions. The same test also
shows the variance of the maxima and minima to be low in the ecliptic north
(99% confidence), but consistent in the south; this effect is not as pronounced
in the Galactic north and south hemispheres.

the most prominent structural feature of this globule to be a strong central
ring of dust column density which was not evident in lower resolution studies
of this cloud. This ring represents a region of high density and pressure that
is likely a transient structure. For a spherical cloud geometry the ring would
correspond to a dense inner shell of high pressure that could not be in
dynamical equilibrium with its surroundings since there appear to be no sources
of pressure in the central regions of the cloud that could support the shell
against gravity and prevent its inward implosion. The timescale for the inward
collapse of the ring would be less than 2 x 10^5 years, suggesting that this
globule is in an extremely early stage of evolution, and perhaps caught in the
process of forming a centrally condensed dense core or Bok globule. Outside its
central regions the globule displays a well-behaved density profile whose shape
is very similar to that of a stable Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Using SEST we also
obtained a C18O spectrum toward the center of the cloud. The CO observation
indicates that the globule is a gravitationally bound object. Analysis of the
CO line profile reveals significant non-thermal gas motions likely due to
turbulence. As a whole the globule may be evolving to a global state of
quasi-static dynamical equilibrium in which thermal and turbulent pressure
balance gravity.

agreement with other analyses that use traditional parameterizations, though we
find marginal (2-sigma) evidence for w(z) < -1 at z < 0.2. In addition to easy
interpretation, uncorrelated, localized band powers allow intuitive and
powerful testing of the constancy of either the energy density or equation of
state. While we have used relatively coarse redshift binning suitable for the
current set of about 150 supernovae, this approach should reach its full
potential in the future, when applied to thousands of supernovae found from

morphological type of the galaxies in a group we are able to quantify the

evolution, which is correlated with the spatial configuration of the galaxies
making up a CG. We distinguish three main configuration: Type A CGs show
predominantly low velocity dispersions and are rich in late-type spirals that
are active in terms of star formation or harbor an AGN; Type B groups have
intermediate velocity dispersions and contain a large fraction of interacting
or merging galaxies; Type C is formed by CGs with high velocity dispersions,
which are dominated by elliptical galaxies that show no activity. We suggest
that the level of evolution increases in the sense A-->B-->C. Mapping the
groups with different evolution levels in a diagram of radius versus velocity
dispersion does not reveal the pattern expected based on the conventional fast
merger model for CGs. Instead, we observe a trend that goes contrary to
expectation: the level of evolution of a group increases with velocity
dispersion. This trend seems to be related to the masses of the structures in
which CGs are embedded. In general, the level of evolution of a group increases
with the mass of the structure. This suggests either that galaxies evolve more
rapidly in massive structures or that the formation of CGs embedded in massive
structures predated the formation of CGs associated with lower mass systems.

blackbody. We show, that in the limit of small temperature fluctuations, the
superposition of blackbodies leads to a y-type spectral distortion. It is
known, that the CMB dipole induces a y-type spectral distortion with quadrupole
and monopole angular distribution leading to a corresponding whole sky
y-parameter of y~2.6\cdot 10^{-7}.We show here that taking the difference of
the CMB signal in the direction of the maximum and minimum of the CMB dipole
due to the superposition of two blackbodies leads to a spectral distortion with
y~3.1\cdot 10^{-6}. The amplitude of this distortion can be calculated to the
same precision as the CMB dipole, i.e. 0.3% today. Therefore it may be used as
a source with brightness of several or tens of \muK to cross calibrate and
calibrate different frequency channels of CMB surveys with precision of a few
tens or hundreds of nK. Furthermore, we show in this work that primordial

detected nine SX Phoenicis stars including three new ones. All the SX Phoenicis
stars are located in the blue straggler region in the color-magnitude diagram
of NGC 5466. Five of them show clearly double-radial mode features, the periods
of which are well consistent with the theoretical ratio of the first overtone
mode to the fundamental mode (P$_{1H}$/P$_F$). Normally, it has not been easy
to secure a P-L relation of the SX Phoenicis stars, because determination of
the pulsational mode of the SX Phoenicis stars has been difficult. The
existence of five SX Phoenicis stars in NGC5466 with double-radial modes allows
us to derive reliably a P-L relation for the fundamental mode of the SX
Phoenicis stars. Using seven SX Phoenicis stars including five stars with
double-radial modes, we derive a P-L relation for the fundamental mode in NGC

special interest for several reasons. The lobes of radio sources can compress
cold gas clumps and trigger star or even dwarf galaxy formation, they can also
transport gas from a host galaxy to large distances and seed the IGM with
magnetic fields. Since GRGs have about 10 to 100 times larger sizes than normal
RGs, their influence on the ambient medium is correspondingly wider and is
pronounced on scales comparable to those of clusters of galaxies or larger.

compensation from two types of bands with anti-phase gap anisotropies with each

superconducting instability, is the gamma-band with the lines of gap minima
along the [100] directions, and the passive band is the alpha- and beta-bands
with the lines of gap minima or zeros along the [110] directions in their

heat for the field in the c-direction, which supports the line-node-like gap
structures running along the kz direction.

``capillary'' pressure. Conversely a very large slippage of the fluid on this
composite interface is found in this superhydrophobic state. Second, we propose
a macroscopic estimate of the effective slip length on the basis of continuum
hydrodynamics, in order to rationalize the previous MD results. This
calculation allows to estimate the effect of a heterogeneous slip length

in good agreement at low pressure, but highlights the role of the exact shape
of the liquid-vapor interface at higher pressure. These results confirm that
small variations in the roughness of a surface can lead to huge differences in

SL(2)/U(1) times a compact CFT), though we expect our qualitative results to be

single poles as a function of the d-dimensional momentum p, which correspond to
normalizable states localized near the tip of the SL(2)/U(1) cigar. Additional
poles arise due to the non-trivial dynamics in the bulk of the cigar, and these
can lead to a type of UV/IR mixing. Our results explain some previously
puzzling features of the low energy behavior of the Green functions. As another
application, we compute the precise combinations of single-trace and
multi-trace operators in the low-energy gauge theory which map to single string
vertex operators in the N=(1,1) supersymmetric d=6 LST. We also discuss the

a larger, exceptional, group. A detailed analysis is carried out for $M$-theory
compactified on a 3-torus, where the target-space $Sl(3,\Zint)\times
Sl(2,\Zint)$ $U$-duality and $Sl(3,\Zint)$ world-volume modular groups are
embedded in $E_{6(6)}(\Zint)$. Unlike previous semi-classical expansions,
$U$-duality is built in manifestly and realized at the quantum level thanks to
Fourier invariance of cubic characters. In addition to winding modes, a pair of
new discrete, flux-like, quantum numbers are necessary to ensure invariance
under the larger group. The action for these modes is of Born-Infeld type,
interpolating between standard Polyakov and Nambu-Goto membrane actions. After
integration over the membrane moduli, we recover the known $R^4$ amplitude,
including membrane instantons. Divergences are disposed of by trading the
non-compact volume integration for a compact integral over the two variables
conjugate to the fluxes -- a constant term computation in mathematical
parlance. As byproducts, we suggest that, in line with membrane/fivebrane
duality, the $E_6$ theta series also describes five-branes wrapped on $T^6$ in
a manifestly U-duality invariant way. In addition we uncover a new action of
$E_6$ on ten dimensional pure spinors, which may have implications for ten

non-commutative. Our results are obtained from numerical simulations of the
lattice model, after its mapping onto a dimensionally reduced, twisted
Hermitian matrix model. In this way we first reveal the explicit phase diagram
of the non-commutative \lambda \phi^{4} lattice model. We observe that the
ordered regime splits into a phase of uniform order and a phase of two stripes
of opposite sign, and more complicated patterns. Next we discuss the behavior
of the spatial and temporal correlators. From the latter we extract the
dispersion relation, which allows us to introduce a dimensionful lattice
spacing. To extrapolate to zero lattice spacing and infinite volume we perform
a double scaling limit, which keeps the non-commutativity tensor constant. The
dispersion relation in the disordered phase stabilizes in this limit, which
represents a non-perturbative renormalization. In particular this confirms the
existence of a striped phase in the continuum limit, in accordance with a
conjecture by Gubser and Sondhi. The extrapolated dispersion relation also
exhibits UV/IR mixing as a non-perturbative effect. Finally we add some
observations about a Nambu-Goldstone mode in the striped phase, and about the
corresponding model in d=2.

walk is likewise determined by the branching number of the tree. Finally, we
show that the branching number determines the rate of first-passage percolation
on trees, also known as the first-birth problem. Our techniques depend on
quasi-Bernoulli percolation and large deviation results.

least two phase transitions as the infection parameter lambda is varied. For
small values of lambda a single infection eventually dies out. For larger
lambda the infection lives forever with positive probability but eventually
leaves any finite set. (The survival probability is a continuous function of
lambda, and the proof of this is much easier than it is for the contact process
on d-dimensional integer lattices.) For still larger lambda the infection
converges in distribution to a nontrivial invariant measure. For an n-ary tree,
with n large, the first of these transitions occurs when lambda~1/n and the
second occurs when 1/2 sqrt{n}<lambda<e/sqrt{n}. Nonhomogeneous trees whose
vertices have degrees varying between 1 and n behave essentially as homogeneous
n-ary trees, provided that vertices of degree n are not too rare. In
particular, letting n go to infty, Galton-Watson trees whose vertices have
degree n with probability that does not decrease exponentially with n may have
both phase transitions occur together at lambda=0. The nature of the second
phase transition is not yet clear and several problems are mentioned in this
regard.

fundamental domain. If G is finite, let T be a random spanning tree chosen
uniformly from all spanning trees of G; if G is infinite, known methods show
that this still makes sense, producing a random essential spanning forest of G.
A method for calculating local characteristics (i.e. finite-dimensional
marginals) of T from the transfer-impedance matrix is presented. This differs
from the classical matrix-tree theorem in that only small pieces of the matrix
(n-dimensional minors) are needed to compute small (n-dimensional) marginals.
Calculation of the matrix entries relies on the calculation of the Green's
function for G, which is not a local calculation. However, it is shown how the
calculation of the Green's function may be reduced to a finite computation in
the case when G is an infinite graph admitting a Z^d-action with finite
quotient. The same computation also gives the entropy of the law of T. These
results are applied to the problem of tiling certain lattices by dominos - the
so-called dimer problem. Another application of these results is to prove
modified versions of conjectures of Aldous on the limiting distribution of
degrees of a vertex and on the local structure near a vertex of a uniform
random spanning tree in a lattice whose dimension is going to infinity.
Included is a generalization of moments to tree-valued random variables and
criteria for these generalized moments to determine a distribution.

Simultaneously and independently, Newman and Piza have achieved the same result
for {0,1}-valued passage times. Their methods extend to more general passage
times, while ours work only for exponential times. On the other hand, our
theorem shows that the variance comes from fluctuations of nonvanishing
probability in the sense that, as n->infty, the law of T(0,n) is not tight

cells to control a large number of biological processes, such as gene
expression and cell signalling. In biochemical networks, the concentrations of
the components are often low. This means that the discrete nature of the
reactants and the stochastic character of their interactions have to be taken
into account. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the components can be of
crucial importance. However, the current numerical techniques for simulating
biochemical networks either ignore the particulate nature of matter or treat
the spatial fluctuations in a mean-field manner. We have developed a new
technique, called Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD), that makes it
possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in both
time and space. In this scheme, a maximum time step is chosen such that only
single particles or pairs of particles have to be considered. For these
particles, the Smoluchowski equation can be solved analytically using Green's
functions. The main idea of GFRD is to exploit the exact solution of the
Smoluchoswki equation to set up an event-driven algorithm. This allows GFRD to
make large jumps in time when the particles are far apart from each other.
Here, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene expression. The
simulations reveal that the scheme is highly efficient. Under biologically
relevant conditions, GFRD is up to six orders of magnitude faster than
conventional particle-based techniques for simulating biochemical networks in
time and space.

methods has given a new spin to our ability to probe protein interactions in
cellular and sub-cellular compartments. Despite the increasing detection
sensitivity, quantitative information that can be obtained from these imaging
methods is limited. This is primarily due to (i) the difficulty in tracking the
problem analytically and (ii) limitations in spatio-temporal resolution that
can be achieved in interrogating living cells in real time. A novel point of
view based on diffusion-driven percolative clustering is proposed here that can
plausibly shed more light on the complex issues of protein-protein
interactions. Since this model is open to computational analysis, it is
quantitative in its premise. Besides being able to analyze the phenomenon, the
power of any model is gauged by its ability to predict interesting and novel
features of the phenomenon itself, which can subsequently be tested by
additional experiments. To this end, an experimental assay based on
fluorescence lifetime imaging is proposed to verify the validity of the
percolation model.

controlled processing of the information. By switching the coupling field back

propagate out as slow light pulses. We calculate the fidelity of information
transfer between the atomic and light fields upon the switch-on and subsequent
