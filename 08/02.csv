using a deterministic core-accretion planet formation model. According to this
model, gas giants formed and acquired their mass $M_{\rm p}$ through
planetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence of cores onto which gas is
accreted. These protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semi-major
axis $a$ through their tidal interaction with their nascent disk. Based on the
observed properties of protostellar disks, we generate $M_{\rm p}$-$a$
distribution. Our results reproduce the observed lack of planets with
intermediate mass $M_{\rm p} = 10$--100$M_{\oplus}$ and $a \la 3$AU and with
large mass $M_{\rm p} \ga 10^3 M_{\oplus}$ and $a \la 0.2$AU. Based on the
simulated $M_{\rm p}$-$a$ distributions, we also evaluate the metallicity
dependence of fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable with
current radial velocity survey. If protostellar disks attain the same fraction
of heavy elements which are contained in their host stars, the detection
probability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because
protoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to
their depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate
rapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The theoretically
extrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observation. This
correlation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario.
We also suggest other metallicity dependence of the planet distributions that
can be tested by on-going observations.

a significant fraction of massive galaxies undergo a major merger at z<1, as
evidenced by close pair statistics, morphologically-disturbed galaxy counts,

strongly correlated to that of the other particles. Recent breakthrough
Lagrangian experiments with high resolution of Kolmogorov scale have motivated
growing interest to acceleration of a fluid particle. Experimental stationary
statistics of Lagrangian acceleration conditioned on Lagrangian velocity
reveals essential dependence of the acceleration variance upon the velocity.
This is confirmed by direct numerical simulations. Lagrangian intermittency is
considerably stronger than the Eulerian one. Statistics of Lagrangian
acceleration depends on Reynolds number. In this review we present description

some advance in phenomenological study of the Lagrangian single-particle
dynamics. Simple Lagrangian stochastic modeling by Langevin-type dynamical
equations is one the widely used tools. The models are aimed particularly to
describe the observed highly non-Gaussian conditional and unconditional

recently analyzed large spectral fluctuations in single molecule spectra of

they originate in a charge transfer interaction of an adsorbed molecule with
the surface. We argued that the fluctuations are due to variations of the local
work function at the position of the molecule. In the current paper the
fluctuations are further analyzed in terms of the intensity ratio between a
fluctuating and a quiescent band, and it is found that the distribution of this
ratio is independent of laser power, unlike the correlation time of the
fluctuations. We show that a simple model, based on the energetics of charge
transfer, can be used to extract the local work function distribution from the
intensity ratio distribution. In a second experiment, single molecule spectra
are collected from colloids immersed in water and in glycerol and a threefold
decrease in fluctuation rate is found in the more viscous fluid. This indicates
that surface dynamics are indeed responsible for the fluctuations, involving
the motion of the adsorbed molecule and possibly also that of surface silver

with pure d-wave pairing symmetry. Here we discuss d-wave states under the
combined influence of impurities and competing instabilities, such as pairing
in a secondary channel as well as lattice symmetry breaking. Using the
self-consistent T-matrix formalism, we show that disorder can strongly modify
the competition between different pairing states. For a d-wave superconductor
in the presence of a subdominant local attraction, Anderson's theorem implies
that disorder always generates an s-wave component in the gap at sufficiently
low temperature, even if a pure d_{x^2-y^2} order parameter characterizes the
clean system. In contrast, disorder is always detrimental to an additional
d_{xy} component. This qualitative difference suggests that disorder can be
used to discriminate among different mixed-gap structures in high-temperature
superconductors. We also investigate superconducting phases with lattice
symmetry breaking in the form of bond order, and show that the addition of
impurities quickly leads to the restoration of translation invariance. Our
results highlight the importance of controlling disorder for the observation of
competing order parameters in cuprates.

antiperiodic for the other two. The focus of the study is on the non-trivial
vacuum structure and the fermion condensate. It is shown that the
indefinite-metric quantization of free gauge bosons is not compatible with the
residual gauge symmetry of the interacting theory. A suitable quantization of
the unphysical modes of the gauge field is necessary in order to guarantee the
consistency of the subsidiary condition and allow the quantum representation of
the residual gauge symmetry of the classical Lagrangian: the 3-color component
of the gauge field must be quantized in a space with an indefinite metric while
the other two components require a positive-definite metric. The contribution
of the latter to the free Hamiltonian becomes highly pathological in this
representation, but a larger portion of the interacting Hamiltonian can be
diagonalized, thus allowing perturbative calculations to be performed. The

characteristic time $t_{\times}(\epsilon_0) \sim b - (1/\lambda_{max}) \ln
(\epsilon_0)$, where $\lambda_{max}$ is the largest Lyapunov exponent and $b$
is a constant. For times $t < t_{\times}$ perturbations exhibit spatial
correlations up to a typical distance $\xi \sim t^z$. For times larger than
$t_{\times}$ finite perturbations are no longer described by tangent space
equations, memory of spatial correlations is progressively destroyed and
perturbations become spatiotemporal white noise. We are able to explain these
results by mapping the problem to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class of

field theory. A set of tensor structures is introduced to define 12 independent
Compton amplitudes. The scalar and vector amplitudes are calculated up to

contribution to the vector amplitudes is found to come from the spin-orbit type
of relativistic corrections. A double-helicity dependent cross section
$\Delta_1 \sigma = (\sigma_{+1-1}-\sigma_{+1+1})/2$ is calculated to the same
order, and the effect of the nucleon isoscalar spin-dependent polarizabilities
is found to be smaller than the effect of isoscalar spin-independent ones.
Contributions of spin-independent polarizabilities are investigated in various
asymmetries, one of which has as large as 12 (26) percent effect at the
center-of-mass photon energy 30 (50) MeV.

the conservation laws of parity and angular momentum for the analysis of

is in essence a partial wave analysis of the production mechanism the result
should be less dependent on the model parameters. Our analysis shows that the
angular distribution and photon polarization asymmetry for the process of
neutron target are sensitive to the parity of the $\Theta^+$, but not for the
case of proton target. In the case of proton target, the polarization
asymmetries of target and recoiled $\Theta^+$ are preferred for parity

through studying the transitional amplitudes in J/psi-> p\barN*, N*\barN*
decays. We begin with perturbative QCD to describe the dynamical process for
the J/psi-> 3\bar q+3q decay to the lowest order of \alpha_s, and by extending
the modified quark creation model to the J/psi energy region to describe the
J/psi-> 3\bar q+3q +g process. The non-perturbative effects are incorporated by
a simple quark model of baryons to evaluate the angular distribution parameters
and decay widths for the processes J/psi-> pbar N*,N*bar N*. From fitting the
decay width of J/psi->gamma p pbar to the experimental data, we extract the
quark-pair creation strength g_I=15.40 GeV. Our numerical results for
J/psi->pbar N*,N* bar N* decays show that the branching ratios for these decays
are quite different if the Roper resonance is assumed to be a common $3q$ state
or a pure hybrid state. For testing its mixing properties, we present a scheme
to construct the Roper wave function by mixing |qqqg> state with a normal
|qqq,2s> state. Under this picture, the ratios of the decay widths to that of
the J/psi->p pbar decay are re-evaluated versus the mixing parameter. A test of
the hybrid nature of the Roper resonance in J/psi decays is discussed.

dimensional quantum channels is introduced. It is shown that despite
nonexistence of an optimal ensemble in this case it is possible to define the
notion of the output optimal average state for such a channel. The
characterization of the output optimal average state and a ""minimax"" expression
for the Holevo capacity are obtained. This makes it possible to prove
equivalence of several additivity properties for infinite dimensional quantum
channels.
  The notion of the $\chi$-function for an infinite dimensional channel is
considered, its strong concavity and lower semicontinuity are shown.
  The problem of continuity of the Holevo capacity is also discussed. It is
shown that the Holevo capacity is continuous function of a channel in the
finite dimensional case while in general it is only lower semicontinuous. This
conclusion is confirmed by the example.
  The main result of this note is the statement that additivity of the Holevo
capacity for all finite dimensional channels implies additivity of the Holevo
capacity for all infinite dimensional channels with arbitrary constraints. The
subadditivity of the $\chi$-function for two infinite dimensional channels with
one of them noiseless or entanglement breaking is also proved.

the properties of the map. Many of the general mathematical properties of maps
of the circle translate into properties of the field in the cavity. For
example, we give a complete classification of the possible resonances in the
system, and show that small enough perturbations do not destroy the resonances.
We use some mathematical identities to give transparent physical interpretation
of the processes of creation and amplification of the quantum field due to the
motion of the boundary and to elucidate the similarities and the differences
between the classical and quantum fields in domains with moving boundaries.
