O'Mara (1991, 1995) and the spectrum synthesis software developed by John Ross,
the abundances of Fe, Mg, Ca and Na in Alpha Centauri A are determined from
strong lines. The abundances are approximately 0.2 dex higher than in the Sun.
The derived abundances are independent of non-thermal motions in the atmosphere
of Alpha Centauri A.
  The microturbulence obtained from medium-strong lines using the abundances
obtained from the strong lines is 1.34 +/- 0.12 km/s, i.e., 0.20 km/s larger
than in the Sun, which is fully consistent with the lower surface gravity of
Alpha Centauri A. This microturbulence can then be used in determination of the
abundance of other elements for which there are no strong lines in the
spectrum.
  This thesis is the first application of this theory to determine abundances
and the microturbulence of Alpha Centauri A. Recent results are published by

  Microwave Background","5 pages, no figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The standard method for observationally confirming the existence of a
predicted finite topology of the universe involves searching for the repetition
of the same finite or extended source in different directions. However, serious
problems are encountered when studying both types of sources, finite and
extended. In studying a finite source, such as a star, galaxy, or quasar, the
problem of its evolution must be dealt with. The same source seen in different
directions is observed at different distances (i.e., ages), making its
identification extremely difficult. Studying extended sources, such as
circles-in-the-sky (CIS) within the cosmic microwave background (CMB), is also
problematic since it requires an unrealistic zero width last scattering surface
(LSS) to produce the predicted identical temperatures on the circles. It is
shown here that these temperatures are no longer identical when a realistic
finite width LSS is taken into account. A new method for studying the topology
of the universe which avoids the above mentioned problems in studying both
finite and extended sources is suggested here. It consists of searching for
increased temperature fluctuations in the regions of the intersections of the
LSS with the faces of the fundamental polyhedron of the finite topology.
Appreciably greater fluctuations are predicted in these regions. A worked-out
example is given.

liquid-condensation, raining out from the central regions of hot, gaseous
protoplanets. The mass of protoplanetary-Earth, estimated to be 275-305mE, is
similar to the mass of Jupiter, 318mE. Solar primordial gases and volatile
elements were separated from the terrestrial planets early after planet
formation, presumably during some super-luminous solar event, perhaps even
before Mercury had completely formed. The

systems than the present-day-terrestrial-planet mass distribution. Although
primarily formed by raining out from the centers of hot, gaseous protoplanets,

NLED leads to a new effective GL, which depends also on the $B$-field
permeating the pulsar. The apparent radius of a SMP appears then unexpectedly
diminished, by a large factor, as compared to the classical Einstein's

This leads to the higher crystallinity and piezoelectricity observed

molecular dynamics (MD), we find that the energy barrier necessary to nucleate
a kink (gauche pairs separated by trans bonds) in an all-T crystal is much
lower (14.9 kcal/mol) in P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer than in PVDF (24.8 kcal/mol).
This correlates with the observation that the polar phase of the copolymer
exhibits a solid-solid a transition to a non-polar phase under heating while
PVDF directly melts. We also studied the mobility of an interface between a
polar and non-polar phases under uniaxial stress; we find a lower threshold
stress and a higher mobility in the copolymer as compared with PVDF. Finally,
considering plastic deformation under applied shear, we find that the chains
for P(VDF-TrFE) have a very low resistance to sliding, particularly along the
chain direction. The atomistic characterization of these ""unit mechanisms""

of 1/n varying over a range of 0.19 pm 0.04 to 0.29 pm 0.04 with no dependence
on temperature. The average value of 1/n = 0.24 pm 0.01 is consistent with
step-edge diffusion limited fluctuations (n = z = 4, conserved noise). The
magnitude of the time correlation function and the width of the fluctuations
both scale with temperature with the same apparent activation energy of Eeff =
0.21 pm 0.02 eV, indicating that the correlation time is at most weakly
temperature dependent. Direct analysis of the autocorrelation function confirms
that the correlation time is at most weakly temperature dependent, and thus the
apparent correlation length is strongly temperature dependent. This behavior
can be reproduced by assuming that the apparent correlation length is governed
by the longest wavelength of step fluctuations that can be sampled in the
measurement time interval. Evaluation of the correlation time for previous
measurements for Al/Si(111) (z =2) yields the same conclusion about measurement
time interval. In both cases the ratio of the measurement time to the effective

assumption on the conformal factor needs to be made. In this second paper of
our series ``Light deflection in Weyl gravity'', we analyze the constraints
imposed by light deflection experiments on the linear parameter of Weyl's
theory. Regarding solar system experiments, the recent CASSINI Doppler
measurements are used to infer an upper bound, $\sim 10^{-19} $m$^{-1}$, on the
absolute value of the above Weyl parameter. In non-solar system experiments, a
condition for unbound orbits together with gravitational mirage observations
enable us to further constrain the allowed negative range of the Weyl parameter
to $\sim -10^{-31} $m$^{-1}$. We show that the characteristics of the light
curve in microlensing or gravitational mirages, deduced from the lens equation,
cannot be recast into the General Relativistic predictions by a simple
rescaling of the deflector mass or of the ring radius. However, the corrective
factor, which depends on the Weyl parameter value and on the lensing
configuration, is small, even perhaps negligible, owing to the upper bound
inferred on the absolute value of a negative Weyl parameter. A statistical
study on observed lensing systems is required to settle the question.
  Our Weyl parameter range is more reliable than the single value derived by
Mannheim and Kazanas from fits to galactic rotation curves, $\sim +10^{-26}\
$m$^{-1}$. Indeed, the latter, although consistent with our bounds, is biased
by the choice of a specific conformal factor.

the full-dimensional open cells in a decomposition of a torus naturally
associated with M. Furthermore, they can be characterized by the relative
compactness of a certain group associated with them.
  Baetica has given examples of Cohen-Macaulay divisorial ideals that are not
conic. Wereview his construction and streamline the arguments somewhat.
  In the last part of the paper we investigate the multiplicities ofthe conic
classes in the decomposition of R^{1/n} as a function of n.This multiplicity
turns out to be a quasi-polynomial for all n >= 1 counting the lattice points
in the union of the interiors of certain cells of the complex mentioned above.
This argument can be used for the computation of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity
of R in characteristic p > 0. In addition it yields some assertions about the
Hilbert-Kunz function of R.

before. However, this nonlinear theory has a disturbing point: a discontinuity
of tangential wind and geopotential with radius. In this second Part, this
discontinuity will be eliminated satisfactorily without any significant changes

composites, both the distribution and size of the component phase particles are
often inadequately taken into account. Commonly, the spatial distributions are
characterized by volume fraction alone, while the electromagnetic response of
each component particle is represented as a vanishingly small depolarization
volume. The strong-permittivity-fluctuation theory (SPFT) provides an
alternative approach to homogenization wherein a comprehensive description of
distributional statistics of the component phases is accommodated. The
bilocally-approximated SPFT is presented here for the anisotropic homogenized
composite which arises from component phases comprising ellipsoidal particles.
The distribution of the component phases is characterized by a two-point
correlation function and its associated correlation length. Each component
phase particle is represented as an ellipsoidal depolarization region of
nonzero volume. The effects of depolarization volume and correlation length are
investigated through considering representative numerical examples. It is
demonstrated that both the spatial extent of the component phase particles and
their spatial distributions are important factors in estimating coherent
scattering losses of the macroscopic field.

for large $A$. Instead of the HH basis, here we use the ""potential harmonics""
(PH) basis, which is a subset of HH basis. We assume that the contribution to
the orbital and grand orbital [in $3(A-1)$-dimensional space of the reduced
motion] quantum numbers comes only from the interacting pair. This implies
inclusion of two-body correlations only and disregard of all higher-body
correlations. Such an assumption is ideally suited for the Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC), which is extremely dilute. Unlike the $(3A-4)$ hyperspherical
variables in HH basis, the PH basis involves only three {\it{active}}
variables. It drastically reduces the number of coupled equations and
calculation of the potential matrix becomes tremendously simplified, as it
involves integrals over only three variables for any $A$. One can easily
incorporate realistic atom-atom interactions in a straight forward manner. We
study the ground and excited state properties of the condensate for both
attractive and repulsive interactions for various particle number.
