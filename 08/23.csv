doppler shift of the H_2 v=1-0 S(1) emission line obtained by Fabry-Perot

from the core indicating the existence of a possible accelarating machanism.
Cep A(E) has an almost constant mean radial velocity of -18 km/s along the
region although with a large dispersion in velocity, indicating the possibility
of a turbulent outflow. A detailed analysis of the Cep A(E) region shows
evidence for the presence of a Mach disk on that outflow. Also, we argue that
the presence of a velocity gradient in Cep A(W) is indicative of a C-shock in
this region. Following Riera et al. (2003), we analyzed the data using wavelet
analysis to study the line width and the central radial velocity distributions.
We found that both outflows have complex spatial and velocity structures
characteristic of a turbulent flow.

the blue GC subpopulation. The varying ratio of red-to-blue GCs with radius can
largely explain the overall GC system colour gradient. The underlying galaxy
starlight has a similar density profile slope and colour to the red GCs. This
suggests a direct connection between the galaxy field stars and the red GC

gradient, but only two models fit also the carbon gradient, those based on
carbon yields that increase with metallicity due to stellar winds in massive
stars (MS) and decrease with metallicity due to stellar winds in low and
intermediate mass stars (LIMS). The successful models also fit the C/O versus
O/H evolution history of the solar vicinity obtained from stellar observations.
We also compare the present day N/H gradient and the N/O versus O/H and the
C/Fe, N/Fe, O/Fe versus Fe/H evolution histories of the solar vicinity
predicted by our two best models with those derived from H II regions and from
stellar observations. While our two best models fit the C/H and O/H gradients

metal rich stars. Therefore we conclude that our two best models solve the C
enrichment problem, but that further work needs to be done on the N enrichment
problem. By adding the C and O production since the Sun was formed predicted by
Models 1 and 2 to the observed solar values we find an excellent agreement with
the O/H and C/H values of the solar vicinity derived from H II regions O and C
recombination lines. One of the most important results of this paper is that
the fraction of carbon due to MS and LIMS in the interstellar medium is
strongly dependent on time and on the galactocentric distance; at present about
half of the carbon in the interstellar medium of the solar vicinity has been
produced by MS and half by LIMS.

signals from celestial sources have to be discerned, are a notorious problem
for low and intermediate energy gamma-ray astronomy (~50 keV - 10 MeV).
Therefore a detailed qualitative and quantitative understanding of instrumental
line and continuum backgrounds is crucial for most stages of gamma-ray
astronomy missions, ranging from the design and development of new
instrumentation through performance prediction to data reduction. We have
developed MGGPOD, a user-friendly suite of Monte Carlo codes built around the
widely used GEANT (Version 3.21) package, to simulate ab initio the physical
processes relevant for the production of instrumental backgrounds. These
include the build-up and delayed decay of radioactive isotopes as well as the
prompt de-excitation of excited nuclei, both of which give rise to a plethora
of instrumental gamma-ray background lines in addition to continuum
backgrounds. The MGGPOD package and documentation are publicly available for
download from http://sigma-2.cesr.fr/spi/MGGPOD/.
  We demonstrate the capabilities of the MGGPOD suite by modeling high
resolution gamma-ray spectra recorded by the Transient Gamma-Ray Spectrometer
(TGRS) on board Wind during 1995. The TGRS is a Ge spectrometer operating in
the 40 keV to 8 MeV range. Due to its fine energy resolution, these spectra
reveal the complex instrumental background in formidable detail, particularly
the many prompt and delayed gamma-ray lines. We evaluate the successes and
failures of the MGGPOD package in reproducing TGRS data, and provide
identifications for the numerous instrumental lines.

Seyfert 1 PG 1402+261. The EPIC X-ray spectrum of PG 1402+261 shows a strong
excess of counts between 6-9 keV in the rest frame. This feature can be modeled
by an unusually strong (equivalent width 2 keV) and very broad (FWHM velocity
of 110000 km/s) iron K-shell emission line. The line centroid energy at 7.3 keV
appears blue-shifted with respect to the iron Kalpha emission band between
6.4-6.97 keV, while the blue-wing of the line extends to 9 keV in the quasar
rest frame. The line profile can be fitted by reflection from the inner
accretion disk, but an inclination angle of >60 deg is required to model the
extreme blue-wing of the line. Furthermore the extreme strength of the line
requires a geometry whereby the hard X-ray emission from PG 1402+261 above 2
keV is dominated by the pure-reflection component from the disk, while little
or none of the direct hard power-law is observed. Alternatively the spectrum
above 2 keV may instead be explained by an ionized absorber, if the column
density is sufficiently high (N_H > 3 x 10^23 cm^-2) and if the matter is
ionized enough to produce a deep (tau~1) iron K-shell absorption edge at 9 keV.
This absorber could originate in a large column density, high velocity outflow,
perhaps similar to those which appear to be observed in several other high
accretion rate AGN. Further observations, especially at higher spectral
resolution, are required to distinguish between the accretion disk reflection
or outflow scenarios.

clusters presently observed in the Galactic halo formed in external dwarf
galaxies, by means of a detailed comparison between Zinn's ""old halo"", ""young

galaxies. The Galactic sub-systems possess distinct spatial and age
distributions, age-metallicity relationships, and orbital parameters, although
we observe some OH clusters with ages and orbits more similar to those of YH
objects. Almost all Galactic globulars with large core radii (r_c) fall into
the YH sub-system, while the OH and BD ensembles are characterized by compact
clusters. The majority of the external clusters are indistinguishable from the
Galactic YH objects in terms of HB morphology, but 20-30% of external clusters
have HB morphologies most similar to the Galactic OH clusters. In addition, the
external clusters have an r_c distribution which very closely matches that for
the YH objects. The old halo r_c distribution can be very well represented by a
composite distribution formed from 83-85% of objects with structures typical of
BD clusters, and 15-17% of objects with structures typical of external
clusters. Taken together our results fully support the accretion hypothesis. We
conclude that all 30 YH clusters and 15-17% of the OH clusters (10-12 objects)
are of external origin. The Galaxy may therefore have experienced ~7 merger
events with cluster-bearing dSph-type galaxies during its lifetime, building up
45-50% of the mass of the stellar halo. Finally, we identify a number of OH
objects which have properties characteristic of accreted clusters. Several of
the clusters associated with the recently proposed CMa dwarf fall into this
category.

mapped onto the entropic trap model proposed by Barrat and M\'ezard. In the
intermediate case $1 \ll K \ll N$, the dynamics corresponds to a modified
version of the Barrat and M\'ezard model, which includes a slow (rather than
instantaneous) decorrelation at each step. A transition from an activated
regime to an entropic one is observed at temperature $T_g/2$ in agreement with
recent work on this model. Ergodicity breaking occurs for $T<T_g/2$ in the
thermodynamic limit, if $K/N \to 0$. In this temperature range, the model
exhibits a non trivial fluctuation-dissipation relation leading for $K \ll N$
to a single effective temperature equal to $T_g/2$. These results give new
insights on the relevance and limitations of the picture proposed by simple

massless quarks and non-zero baryon density is performed. It is assumed that at
zero baryonic density, $\rho=0$, the temperature phase transition is of the
second order and quark condesate $\eta=< 0\mid \bar{u} u\mid 0> =< 0 \mid
\bar{d}d\mid 0>$ may be taken as order parameter of phase transition. The
baryon masses strongly violate chiral symmetry, $m_B \sim < 0 \mid \bar{q}q\mid

quark condensate takes place up to phase transition point, it is shown, that at
finite baryon density $\rho$ the phase transition becomes of the first order at
the temperature $T=T_{\mathrm{ph}}(\rho)$ for $\rho>0$. At temperatures
$T_{\mathrm{cont}}(\rho) > T > T_{\mathrm{ph}}(\rho)$ there is a mixed phase
consisting of the quark phase (stable) and the hadron phase (unstable). At the
temperature $T = T_{\mathrm{cont}}(\rho)$ the system experiences a continuous
transition to the pure chirally symmetric phase.

of on-board gyroscopes to extraordinary accuracy. Such precessions are
predicted by General Relativity (GR), and one component of this precession is
the `frame-dragging' or Lense-Thirring effect, which is caused by the rotation
of the earth, and the other is the geodetic effect. A new theory of gravity
predicts, however, a second and much larger `frame-dragging' or vorticity
induced spin precession. This spin precession component will also display the
effects of novel gravitational waves which are predicted by the new theory of
gravity, and which have already been seen in several experiments. The magnitude
and signature of these gravitational wave induced precession effects is given
for comparison with the GP-B experimental data.

much debate and confusion since the day it fell. Many mischaracterizations of
the observed phenomena have limited the widespread understanding of the
problem. Nevertheless, there has always been an abundance of evidence in favour
of a negative damping model. Negative damping, or positive feedback, is
responsible for many large amplitude oscillations observed in many
applications. In this paper, we will explain some well-known examples of
positive feedback. We will then present a feedback model, derived from
fundamental physics, capable of explaining a number of features observed in the
instabilities of many bridge decks. This model is supported by computational,

transformation, it was proved by the author that the following weak limit
theorem holds: X^{(d)}_t /t \to dx / \pi (1-x^2) \sqrt{1 - 2 x^2} as t \to
\infty. The present paper shows that a similar type of weak limit theorems is
satisfied for a {\it continuous-time} quantum walk X^{(c)}_t on the line as
follows: X^{(c)}_t /t \to dx / \pi \sqrt{1 - x^2} as t \to \infty. These
results for quantum walks form a striking contrast to the central limit theorem
for symmetric discrete- and continuous-time classical random walks: Y_{t}/

with issue of the relationship between discrete and continuous-time quantum
walks. This topic, subject of a long debate in the previous literature, is
treated within the formalism of matrix representation and the limit
distributions are exhaustively compared in the two cases.

The solutions to this system determine the number of created particles and can
be found by means of numerical methods for arbitrary motions of the walls of

we investigate the creation of massless scalar particles in a one-dimensional
vibrating cavity by means of three particular cavity motions. We compare the

non-cyclic geometric phase tied to the spatial evolution of the system: the
subjacent two-dimensional Hilbert space is spanned by the two possible paths in
the interferometer and the evolution of the state is controlled by phase
shifters and absorbers. A related experiment was reported previously by some of
the authors [Hasegawa et al., PRA 53, 2486 (1996)] to verify the cyclic spatial
geometric phase. The interpretation of this experiment, namely to ascribe a
geometric phase to this particular state evolution, has met severe criticism
[Wagh, PRA 59, 1715 (1999)]. The extension to non-cyclic evolution manifests
the correctness of the interpretation of the previous experiment by means of an
explicit calculation of the non-cyclic geometric phase in terms of paths on the
Bloch-sphere. The theoretical treatment comprises the cyclic geometric phase as
a special case, which is confirmed by experiment.

reliable source of two entangled systems. Such systems have been generated
experimentally several years ago for light but has only in the past few years
been demonstrated for atomic systems. None of these approaches however involve
two atomic systems situated in separate environments. This is necessary for the
creation of entanglement over arbitrary distances which is required for many
quantum information protocols such as atomic teleportation. We present an
experimental realization of such distant entanglement based on an adaptation of
the entanglement of macroscopic gas samples containing about 10^11 cesium atoms
shown previously by our group. The entanglement is generated via the
off-resonant Kerr interaction between the atomic samples and a pulse of light.
The achieved entanglement distance is 0.35m but can be scaled arbitrarily. The
feasibility of an implementation of various quantum information protocols using
macroscopic samples of atoms has therefore been greatly increased. We also
present a theoretical modeling in terms of canonical position and momentum
operators X and P describing the entanglement generation and verification in
presence of decoherence mechanisms.
