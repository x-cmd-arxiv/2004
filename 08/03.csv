  2004","Astrophys.J.618:139-154,2004","10.1086/425894",,"astro-ph",,"  We present XMM-Newton observations of the radio galaxy 3C 120. The hard X-ray
spectrum contains a marginally resolved Fe I K-alpha emission line with
FWHM=9,000 km/s and an equivalent width of 57 eV. The line arises via
fluorescence in a broad-line region with covering fraction of 0.4. There is no
evidence of relativistically broad Fe K-alpha, contrary to some previous
reports. The normal equivalent widths of the X-ray and optical emission lines
exclude a strongly beamed synchrotron component to the hard X-ray and optical
continua. There is an excess of 0.3-2 keV soft X-ray continuum over an
extrapolation of the hard X-ray power-law, which may arise in a disk corona.
Analysis of an archival Chandra image shows that extended emission from the jet
and other sources contributes <3% of the total X-ray flux. A break in the X-ray
spectrum below 0.6 keV indicates an excess neutral hydrogen column density of
N_H=1.57 * 10^21 cm^{-2}. However, the neutral absorber must have an oxygen
abundance of <1/50 of the solar value to explain the absence of an intrinsic or
intervening O I edge. There is no ionized absorption in the soft X-ray
spectrum, but there is a weak, narrow O VIII Ly-alpha emission line. We do not
detect previously claimed O VIII absorption from the intervening intergalactic
medium. Radio observations at 37 GHz show a fast, high frequency flare starting
8 days after the XMM-Newton observation. However, this has no obvious effect on
the X-ray spectrum. The X-ray spectrum, including the soft excess, became
harder as the X-ray flux decreased, with an estimated pivot energy of 40 keV.
The UV and soft X-ray fluxes are strongly correlated over the 120 ks duration
of the XMM-Newton observation. This is qualitatively consistent with
Comptonization of UV photons by a hot corona. (Abridged)

discovered during the optical identification of the X-ray sources in the North
Ecliptic Pole (NEP) region of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and it is the highest
redshift cluster of galaxies of the NEP survey. We have measured spectroscopic
redshifts for twenty cluster galaxies using the Keck-I and the
Canada-France-Hawai'i (CFH) telescopes. The value for the cluster velocity
dispersion is sigma_V=775(+182,-113) km s-1. The cluster was also observed by
XMM-Newton. Both the optical and X-ray data are presented in this paper. The
cluster has an unabsorbed X-ray flux in the 2-10 keV energy band of F(2-10
keV)=1.24(+0.16,-0.23) x 10-13 erg cm2 s-1 and a K-corrected luminosity in the

L(BOL,X)=1.35(+0.08,-0.21)x10^45 h_50^-2 erg s-1. The data do not allow fitting
both metal abundance and temperature at the same time. The abundance is
unconstrained and can vary in the range 0.28-1.42 Z_sun while the best fit
X-ray temperature is T=4.7(+1.2,-0.7) keV. This emission weighted X-ray
temperature is a little lower, barely within the uncertainties, than the
predicted temperature, T=6.34(+0.13,-0.35) keV, from the L_X-T_X relation of
local clusters published in the literature. The optically measured
velocitydispersion is consistent with the velocity dispersion expected from the
sigma_V-T_X relationship. We also examine the point X-ray source

kinetic energy that is substantially different than would be predicted based on
the properties of the galaxy model in the absence of the black hole. The reason
appears to be that the black hole responds to stars whose velocities have
themselves been raised by the presence of the black hole. Over a wide range of
density slopes and black hole masses, the black hole's mean kinetic energy is
equal to what would be predicted under the assumption that it is in energy
equipartition with stars lying within a distance ~r_h/2 from it, where r_h is
the black hole's influence radius. The dependence of the Brownian velocity on
black hole mass is approximately <V^2>~ 1/M^{1/(3-gamma)} with gamma the
power-law index of the stellar density profile, rho~1/r^gamma. This is less
steep than the 1/M dependence predicted in a model where the effect of the
black hole on the stellar velocities is ignored. The influence of a stellar
mass spectrum on the black hole's Brownian motion is also evaluated and found
to be consistent with predictions from Chandrasekhar's theory. We use these
results to derive a probability function for the mass of the Milky Way black
hole based on a measurement of its proper motion velocity. Interesting
constraints on M will require a velocity resolution exceeding 0.5 km/s.

discovered in great numbers in external galaxies with ROSAT, Chandra, and XMM.
The central question regarding this important class of sources is whether they
represent an extension in the luminosity function of binary X-ray sources
containing neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes (BHs), or a new class of
objects, e.g., systems containing intermediate-mass black holes (100-1000
Msun). We have carried out a theoretical study to test whether a large fraction
of the ULXs, especially those in galaxies with recent star formation activity,
can be explained with binary systems containing stellar-mass black holes. To
this end, we have applied a unique set of binary evolution models for
black-hole X-ray binaries, coupled to a binary population synthesis code, to
model the ULXs observed in external galaxies. We find that for donor stars with
initial masses >10 Msun the mass transfer driven by the normal nuclear
evolution of the donor star is sufficient to potentially power most ULXs. This
is the case during core hydrogen burning and, to an even more pronounced
degree, while the donor star ascends the giant branch, though the latter phases
lasts only ~5% of the main sequence phase. We show that with only a modest
violation of the Eddington limit, e.g., a factor of ~10, both the numbers and
properties of the majority of the ULXs can be reproduced. One of our
conclusions is that if stellar-mass black-hole binaries account for a
significant fraction of ULXs in star-forming galaxies, then the rate of
formation of such systems is ~3 x 10^{-7} per year normalized to a
core-collapse supernova rate of 0.01 per year.

structured nebula of ejected material. The best-studied and axisymmetric
components of this outflow consist of bipolar lobes (the ``homunculus'') and an
equatorial ``skirt.'' Recent proper motion measurements suggest that the skirt
was ejected at the same time as the lobes, contrary to the assumptions of all
current theoretical models for the formation of the nebula (which use the skirt
to collimate stellar winds into lobes). We present a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
stellar wind model that produces an outflowing disk and bipolar lobes in a
single, steady-state wind. The basic model consists of a wind from a rotating
star with a rotation-axis-aligned dipole magnetic field. The azimuthal
component of the magnetic field, generated by stellar rotation, compresses the
wind toward the equator and also toward the rotation axis, simultaneously
producing an outflowing disk and jet. We use numerical MHD simulations to study
the wind for various amounts of stellar rotation and to show a range of wind
morphologies. In order to produce wide angle lobes similar to the homunculus
(which have roughly a 30 degree opening angle), a high-speed polar wind (with
enhanced energy density) from the star is also required. In that case, the
structure of the wind bears a remarkable resemblance to the skirt plus
homunculus morphology of the Eta Car nebulae, and a significant fraction of the
stellar angular momentum is carried away by the wind. Although the model
assumes a steady-state wind (rather than an eruption) and thermal wind driving
(rather than radiation pressure), the structure of the wind is encouraging.

later types by the fading of their disks (e.g., as a result of ram-pressure
stripping or strangulation) or by enhancement of the bulge luminosity (e.g.,
due to tidal interactions and mergers). For this purpose, we compare the bulge
and disk luminosities of early- and late-type galaxies and of galaxies at
different radial distances from the cluster center. We find that, in order for
early-type galaxies, including S0s, to have evolved from late-type galaxies,
their bulge luminosities must have been physically enhanced. Disk fading models
cannot explain the differences observed. We then show that galaxy bulges are
systematically brighter at small projected distances from the cluster center,
while disk luminosities are uncorrelated with cluster-centric distance. Our
results suggest that bulge enhancement, not disk fading, distinguishes early

galaxies across a wide field in the cluster, ~10 Mpc. We detect over 500
galaxies in narrow-band emission, with broad-band colours consistent with them
lying at z~0.39. Using this sample we determine the Halpha luminosity function
within the cluster and find that its form is approximately independent of local
density, and is consistent with that seen in the intermediate redshift field
population. This suggests that any density-dependent physical mechanisms which
alter the star formation rate must leave the Halpha luminosity function
unchanged; this is possible if the time-scale for star formation to cease
completely is short compared with a Hubble time. Such short time-scale
transformations are also supported by the presence of a population with
late-type morphologies but no detectable Halpha emission. The fraction of blue
galaxies, and the fraction of galaxies detected in Halpha, decreases strongly
with increasing galaxy density in a manner which is qualitatively similar to
that seen at lower redshifts. This trend is significantly steeper than the
trend with galaxy morphology observed from a panoramic Hubble Space Telescope
image of this cluster; this suggests that the physical mechanisms responsible
for transformations in morphology and star formation rates may be partially
independent. Finally, we compare our data with similar data on clusters
spanning a range of redshifts from 0.2<~z<~0.8 and find little evidence for a
trend in the total amount of star formation in clusters with redshift.

Zeippen (1982} and collision strengths from Pradhan (1976), fit the
observations well, although at high electron densities, the [O II]doublet ratio
yields densities systematically lower than those given by the [S II] doublet
ratio, suggesting that the ratio of Aij of the [O II]
doublet,$A(\lambda3729)/A(\lambda3726)$, given by Zeippen (1982) may need to be
revised upwards by ~6%. Our analysis also shows that the more recent
calculations of [O II] A value by Zeippen (1987a) and collision strengths by
McLaughlin & Bell (1998) are inconsistent with the observations at the high and
low density limits, respectively, and can therefore be ruled out. We confirm
the earlier result of Copetti & Writzl (2002) that the [O II] A values
calculated by Wiese et al. (1996) yield electron densities systematically lower
than those deduced from the [S II] doublet ratio and that the discrepancy is
most likely caused by errors in the A values calculated by Wiese et al. Using
our default atomic data set for [\ion{O}{ii}], we find that $N_{\rm

afterglow of GRB 030226, including VLT spectroscopy, VLT polarimetry, and
Chandra X-ray observations. In addition, we present BOOTES-1 wide-field
observations at the time of the occurrence of the burst. First observations at
ESO started 0.2 days after the event when the GRB afterglow was at a magnitude
of R~19 and continued until the afterglow had faded below the detection
threshold (R>26). No underlying host galaxy was found. The optical light curve
shows a break around 0.8 days after the burst, which is achromatic within the
observational errors, supporting the view that it was due to a jetted
explosion. Close to the break time the degree of linear polarization of the
afterglow light was less than 1.1%, which favors a uniform jet model rather
than a structured one. VLT spectra show two absorption line systems at
redshifts z=1.962+/-0.001 and at z=1.986+/-0.001, placing the lower limit for
the redshift of the GRB close to 2. We emphasize that the kinematics and the
composition of the absorbing clouds responsible for these line systems is very
similar to those observed in the afterglow of GRB 021004. This corroborates the
picture in which at least some GRBs are physically related to the explosion of
a Wolf-Rayet star.

distribution of H2 molecules we have undertaken repeated FUSE UV observations
of the runaway O9.5V star, HD34078. In this paper we present five spectra
obtained between January 2000 and October 2002. These observations reveal an
unexpectedly large amount of highly excited H2. Column densities for H2 levels
from (v = 0, J = 0) up to (v = 0, J = 11) and for several v = 1 and v = 2
levels are determined. These results are interpreted in the frame of a model
involving essentially two components: i) a foreground cloud (unaffected by
HD34078) responsible for the H2 (J = 0, 1), CI, CH, CH+ and CO absorptions; ii)
a dense layer of gas (n = 10E4 cm-3) close to the O star and strongly
illuminated by its UV flux which accounts for the presence of highly excited
H2. Our model successfully reproduces the H2 excitation, the CI fine-structure
level populations as well as the CH, CH+ and CO column densities. We also
examine the time variability of H2 absorption lines tracing each of these two
components. From the stability of the J = 0, 1 and 2 damped H2 profiles we
infer a 3 sigma upper limit on column density variations Delta(N(H2))/N(H2) of
5% over scales ranging from 5 to 50 AU. This result clearly rules out any
pronounced ubiquitous small scale ""density"" structure of the kind apparently
seen in HI. The lines from highly excited gas are also quite stable (equivalent
to Delta(N)/N <= 30%) indicating i) that the ambient gas through which HD34078
is moving is relatively uniform and ii) that the gas flow along the shocked
layer is not subject to marked instabilities

extremely young ($<$ 10 Myr) star clusters, which we interpret as a population
of unbound clusters of which a large majority will disrupt within the next
$\sim$10 Myr, and {\it iii)} that the distribution of cluster sizescan be well
approximated by a power-law with exponent, $ -\eta = -2.2 \pm 0.2$, which is
very similar to that of Galactic globular clusters, indicating that cluster
disruption is largely independent of cluster radius. In addition, we have used
this dataset to search for correlations among the derived parameters. In
particular, we do not find any strong trends between the age and mass, mass and
effective radius, nor between the galactocentric distance and effective radius.
There is, however, a strong correlation between the age of a cluster and its
extinction, with younger clusters being more heavily reddened than older
clusters.

the aligned-rotator. The charge depletion from the Goldreich-Julian charge
density causes a large electric field along the magnetic field line. The
electrons or the positrons are accelerated by the field-aligned electric field
and radiate the $\gamma$-rays tangentially to the local magnetic field line.
Some of such $\gamma$-rays collide with $X$-rays to materialize as the
electron-positron pairs on different field lines from the field line on which
they were emitted. As a result, the electric field structure is expected to
change across the field lines. Including these trans-field effects, we solve
the formation of the electric field self-consistently with the curvature
radiation and the pair creation processes. The $\gamma$-ray emission and the
pair creation are treated by use of Monte Carlo technique. We demonstrate that
the distribution of the electric field along the field lines is affected by
both the gap geometry and the external currents coming into the gap through the
boundaries. In the electrodynamical model, it has been known that the solution
disappears if the current density carried by the electron-positron pairs
produced in the gap exceeds a critical value. We show that the critical current
density is significantly increased when the trans-field structure is taken into
account. We also find that the location of the inner boundary of the gap shifts
toward the stellar surface from the conventional null surface as the current
density increases. The reason for the shift is derived from the stability
condition of the inner boundary. We also argue that the ideal-MHD condition
holds outside of the gap only when the low energy particles coexist with the
high energy particles migrating from the gap.

  As it is well known since Lucy's (1968a,b) and Mochnacki's (1981) works,
primary components transfer their own energy to the secondary star via the
common envelope around the two stars. This transfer was parameterized by a
transfer parameter (ratio of the observed and intrinsic luminosities of the
primary star). We proved that this transfer parameter is a simple function of
the mass and luminosity ratio. This newly found relation is valid for all
systems except H type systems which have a different relation.
  We introduced a new type of contact binary stars: H subtype systems which
have a large mass ratio ($q>0.72$). These systems show highly different
behaviour on the luminosity ratio - transfer parameter diagram from other
systems and according to our results the energy transfer rate is less efficient
in them than in other type of contact binary stars. We also show that different
types of contact binaries have well defined locations on the mass ratio -
luminosity ratio diagram. All contact binary systems do not follow Lucy's

The system is formed by almost twin M3e dwarf components that are very close,
but not yet in contact. The spectra of both dwarfs show signatures of the
presence of strong chromospheres. Spectroscopy definitely confirms, therefore,
what was suggested on the basis of photometry: BW3 V38 is indeed a unique
system, as no other similar binary with M components and in such a tight orbit
is known. Within the limits posed by the relatively large errors, due to the
combined effect of system faintness and of the constraints on exposure time,
the derived physical parameters seem to agree with the relations obtained from
the other few known eclipsing binaries with late type components (which
indicate a discrepancy between the available evolutionary models and the data
at ~ 10% level). A possible explanation is the presence of strong magnetic
fields and fast rotation (that applies to the BW3 V38 case as well). A simple
computation of the system secular evolution by angular momentum loss and spin
orbit synchronization shows that the evolution of a system with M dwarfs
components is rather slow, and indicates as well a possible reason why systems
similar to BW3 V38 are so rare.

depletion lies at least 0.6-0.8 dex below minimally depleted (or undepleted)

contributing to HTSC. Here we use topological (non-Hamiltonian) methods to
discuss the data, emphasizing nanoscale phase separation and the importance of
a narrow band of quantum percolative states near the Fermi energy that is
spatially pinned to a self-organized filamentary dopant array. Topological

nematic-isotropic capillary transitions of a nematogen confined by walls that
favor antagonist orientations to the liquid crystal molecules (hybrid cell). We
analyse the behavior of the capillary transition as a function of the
fluid-substrate interactions and the pore width. In addition to the usual
capillary transition between isotropic-like to nematic-like states, we find
that this transition can be suppressed when one substrate is wet by the
isotropic phase and the other by the nematic phase. Under this condition the
system presents interface-like states which allow to continuously transform the
nematic-like phase to the isotropic-like phase without undergoing a phase
transition. Two different mechanisms for the disappearance of the capillary
transition are identified. When the director of the nematic-like state is
homogeneously planar-anchored with respect to the substrates, the capillary
transition ends up in a critical point. This scenario is analogous to the
observed in Ising models when confined in slit pores with opposing surface
fields which have critical wetting transitions. When the nematic-like state has
a linearly distorted director field, the capillary transition continuously
transforms in a transition between two nematic-like states.

effective action Gamma[u] at T>0 for which we find a consistent scaling ansatz
to all orders. The TBL resolves the singularities of the T=0 theory and
contains rare droplet physics. The formal structure of this TBL is explored
around d=4 using a one loop Wilson RG. A more systematic Exact RG (ERG) method
is employed and tested on d=0 models. There we obtain precise relations between
TBL quantities and droplet probabilities which are checked against exact
results. We illustrate how the TBL scaling remains consistent to all orders in
higher d using the ERG and how droplet picture results can be retrieved.
Finally, we solve for d=0,N=1 the formidable ""matching problem"" of how this T>0
TBL recovers a critical T=0 field theory. We thereby obtain the beta-function

Its applicability is often dependent on how high the embedding's distortion is.
For example, embedding finite metric space into trees may require linear
distortion as a function of its size. Using probabilistic metric embeddings,
the bound on the distortion reduces to logarithmic in the size.
  We make a step in the direction of bypassing the lower bound on the
distortion in terms of the size of the metric. We define ""multi-embeddings"" of
metric spaces in which a point is mapped onto a set of points, while keeping
the target metric of polynomial size and preserving the distortion of paths.
The distortion obtained with such multi-embeddings into ultrametrics is at most
O(log Delta loglog Delta) where Delta is the aspect ratio of the metric. In
particular, for expander graphs, we are able to obtain constant distortion
embeddings into trees in contrast with the Omega(log n) lower bound for all
previous notions of embeddings.
  We demonstrate the algorithmic application of the new embeddings for two
optimization problems: group Steiner tree and metrical task systems.

the increase in mass-energy of a general black hole in terms of the infalling
matter and gravitational radiation, is expressed in terms of trapping horizons,
allowing the inclusion of null (isolated) horizons as well as spatial
(dynamical) horizons. This first law of black-hole dynamics is given in
differential and integral forms, regular in the null limit. An effective
gravitational-radiation energy tensor is obtained, providing measures of both
ingoing and outgoing, transverse and longitudinal gravitational radiation on
and near a black hole. Corresponding energy-tensor forms of the first law
involve a preferred time vector which plays the role for dynamical black holes
which the stationary Killing vector plays for stationary black holes.
Identifying an energy flux, vanishing if and only if the horizon is null,
allows a division into energy-supply and work terms, as in the first law of
thermodynamics. The energy supply can be expressed in terms of area increase
and a newly defined surface gravity, yielding a Gibbs-like equation, with a
similar form to the so-called first law for stationary black holes. A
Clausius-like relation suggests a definition of geometric entropy flux. Taking
entropy as area/4 for dynamical black holes, it is shown that geometric entropy
is conserved: the entropy of the black hole equals the geometric entropy
supplied by the infalling matter and gravitational radiation. The area or
entropy of a dynamical horizon increases by the so-called second law, not
because entropy is produced, but because black holes classically are perfect
absorbers.

approximately F_1 for T ~ T_c and it changes to (3/4)F_1+(1/4)U_1 at high
temperatures. In this potential model, the J/psi is weakly bound above the
phase transition temperature T_c, and it dissociates spontaneously above 1.62
T_c, while chi_c and psi' are unbound in the quark-gluon plasma. The bottomium
states Upsilon, chi_b and Upsilon' are bound in the quark-gluon plasma and they
dissociate at 4.10 T_c, 1.18 T_c, and 1.38 T_c respectively. For comparison, we
evaluate the heavy quarkonium binding energies also in other models using the
free energy F_1 or the total internal energy U_1 as the Q-Qbar potential. The
comparison shows that the model with the new Q-Qbar potential proposed in this
manuscript gives dissociation temperatures that agree best with those from
spectral function analyses. We evaluate the cross section for
sigma(g+J/psi->c+cbar) and its inverse process, in order to determine the J/psi
dissociation width and the rate of J/psi production by recombining c and cbar
in the quark gluon plasma.

worldvolume theory on a D3-brane is coupled to gravity and construct a

find that we can have both closed and open universes depending on the initial

singularities. Seiberg duality can be realized as a sequence of
Picard-Lefschetz monodromies on 3-cycles in the mirror manifold. In previous
work, the precise meaning of gauge theories obtained by monodromies that do not
correspond to Seiberg duality was unclear. Recently, it was pointed out that
these theories contain tachyons, suggesting that the collection of marginally
bound branes at the singularity is unstable. We address this problem using
(p,q) web techniques. It is shown that theories with tachyons appear whenever
the (p,q) web contains crossing legs. A recent study of these theories with
tachyons using exceptional collections proposed the notion of ""well split
condition.'' We show the equivalence between the well split condition and the
absence of crossing legs in the (p,q) web. The (p,q) web has a natural
resolution of crossing legs which was first studied in the construction of five
dimensional fixed points using branes. Exploiting this result, we propose a
generic procedure which determines the quiver that corresponds to the stable
bound state of D-branes that live on the singularity after the monodromy. This
set is generically larger than the original set, meaning that there are extra
massless gauge fields and matter fields in the quiver. Alternatively, one can
argue that since these gauge and matter fields are initially assumed to be
absent, the theory exhibits tachyonic excitations. We illustrate our ideas in
an explicit example for D3-branes on a complex cone over dP1, computing both
the quiver and the superpotential.

and an nonintegrable constraint distribution H, with dynamics governed by
Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle. We present two studies both using adapted
moving frames. In the first study we apply Cartan's method of equivalence to
investigate the geometry underlying a nonholonomic system. As an example we
compute the differential invariants for a nonholonomic system on a
four-dimensional configuration manifold endowed with a rank two (Engel)
distribution. In the second part we study G-Chaplygin systems. These are
systems where the constraint distribution is given by a connection on a
principal fiber bundle with total space Q and base space S=Q/G, and with a
G-equivariant Lagrangian. These systems compress to an almost Hamiltonian
system on $T^{*}S$. Under an $s \in S$ dependent time reparameterization a
number of compressed systems become Hamiltonian. A necessary condition for
Hamiltonization is the existence of an invariant measure on the original
system. Assuming an invariant measure we describe the obstruction to
Hamiltonization. Chaplygin's ""rubber"" sphere, a ball with unequal inertia
coefficients rolling without slipping or spinning (about the vertical axis) on
a plane is Hamiltonizable when compressed to $T^{*}SO(3)$. Finally we discuss
reduction of internal symmetries. Chaplygin's ""marble"" (where spinning is
allowed) is not Hamiltonizable when compressed to $T^{*}SO(3)$; we conjecture
that it is also not Hamiltonizable when reduced to $T^{*}S^{2}$.

ring extension of a coring by a module. We study how the properties of a
bimodule such as separability and the Frobenius properties are reflected in the
induced base ring extension coring. Any bimodule that is finitely generated and
projective on one side, together with a map of corings over the same base ring,
lead to the notion of a module-morphism, which extends the notion of a morphism
of corings (over different base rings). A module-morphism of corings induces
functors between the categories of comodules.
  These functors are termed pull-back and push-out functors respectively and
thus relate categories of comodules of different corings. We study when the
pull-back functor is fully faithful and when it is an equivalence. A
generalised descent associated to a morphism of corings is introduced.
  We define a category of module-morphisms, and show that push-out functors are
naturally isomorphic to each other if and only if the corresponding
module-morphisms are mutually isomorphic. All these topics are studied within a
unifying language of bicategories and the extensive use is made of
interpretation of corings as comonads in the bicategory Bim of bimodules and
module-morphisms as 1-cells in the associated bicategories of comonads in Bim.

diameter, crystal length and walk-off. We outline two different theoretical
models for the preparation and collection of either single-mode or multi-mode
PDC light (defined by, for instance, multi-mode fibers or apertures,
corresponding to bucket detection). Moreover, we define the mode-matching
collection efficiency, important for realizing a single-photon source based on
PDC output into a well-defined single spatial mode. We also define a multimode
collection efficiency that is useful for single-photon detector calibration
applications.

momentum of electromagnetic media. However, in Feigel's treatment he did not
take into account the relativistic transformation of the optical constants
(electric permittivity and magnetic permeability) of moving media. Here it is
shown that the effect arising from such a transformation will also provide a
quantum vacuum contribution to the velocity of media, in addition to the one
derived by Feigel himself.

non-unique choice of a transverse basis and is changed by gauge transformations
of the geometric vector potential $\mathbf{a}$. The position operator must
depend on the choice of gauge, but a complete gauge transformation of a
physically distinct state has no observable effects. The potential $\mathbf{a}$
has a Dirac string singularity that is related to an optical vortex of the
electric field.

qubits based on dark-state polaritons in atomic ensembles is discussed. It is
shown that despite the large entanglement of the collective storage states
corresponding to single photons or nonclassical states of light the sensitivity
to decoherence does not scale with the number of atoms. This is due to the
existence of equivalence classes of storage states corresponding to states with
the same number of dark-state polariton excitations but arbitrary excitations
in other polariton modes. Several decoherence processes are discussed in
detail: single-atom spin-flips and dephasing, atom loss and motion of atoms.

Einstein's special theory of relativity, a field is no longer regarded as the
physical manifestation of vibrations in a mechanical medium, but recognized as
a new physical primitive in its own right.
