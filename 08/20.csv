radio-quiet isolated neutron star RX J1605.3+3249 with the Subaru telescope in
1999 and 2003. Together with archival HST images acquired in 2001 these data
reveal a proper motion of mu = 144.5 +/- 13.2 mas/yr. This implies a relatively
high spatial velocity and indicates that the star is unlikely to be re-heated
by accretion of matter from the interstellar medium. Assuming that RX
J1605.3+3249 is a young (10^5-10^6 yr) cooling neutron star, its apparent
trajectory is consistent with a birth in the nearby Sco OB2 OB association at a
location close to that derived for RX J1856.5-3754 and perhaps also to that of
RX J0720.4-3125. This suggests that the X-ray bright part of ROSAT-discovered
isolated neutron stars is dominated by the production of the Sco OB2 complex
which is the closest OB association and a part of the Gould belt. The B and R
magnitudes of the faint optical counterpart did not vary from 1999 to 2003 at B
= 27.22 +/- 0.10. Its B-R colour index of +0.32 +/- 0.17 is significantly
redder than that of other isolated neutron stars and the optical flux lies a
factor 11.5 above the extrapolation of the X-ray blackbody-like spectrum. The
red optical colour reveals the presence of an additional emitting component in
the optical regime over the main neutron star thermal emission. We also
discovered a small elongated Halpha nebula approximately centered on the
neutron star and aligned with the direction of motion. The width of the nebula
is unresolved and smaller than ~ 0.4"" for a length of about 1"". The shape of
the Balmer emitting nebula is very different from those seen close to other
neutron stars and should be confirmed by follow-up observations. We shortly
discuss the possible mechanisms which could give rise to such a geometry.

has a large offset from those of the stellar photospheric lines. The mass of

upon their optical emission characteristics; BL Lacs, with faint or no emission
lines, and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with prominent, broad emission
lines. The spectral energy distribution of FSRQs has generally been thought of
as being more akin to the low-peaked BL Lacs, which exhibit a peak in the
infrared region of the spectrum, as opposed to high-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs),
which exhibit a peak in UV/X-ray region of the spectrum. All blazars currently
confirmed as sources of TeV emission are HBLs. Recent surveys have found
several FSRQs exhibiting spectral properties similar to HBLs, particularly the
synchrotron peak frequency. These objects are potential sources of TeV emission
according to several models of blazar jet emission and blazar evolution.
Measurements of TeV flux or upper limits could impact existing theories
explaining the links between different blazar types and could have a
significant impact on our understanding of the nature of objects that are
capable of TeV emission. In particular, the presence (or absence) of TeV
emission from FSRQs could confirm (or cast doubt upon) recent evolutionary
models that expect intermediate objects in a transitionary state between FSRQ
and BL Lac. The Whipple 10 meter imaging air-Cherenkov gamma-ray telescope is
well suited for TeV gamma-ray observations. Using the Whipple telescope, we

inhomogeneous; we identify 27 features. The line and continuum emission are
modeled using a collection of HII regions at different distances from the
nucleus assuming a single-density component and two-density components. The
high-density component has a density of 4 X 10^{4} cm^{-3}. However, the bulk
of the ionization is in regions with densities which are typically a factor 10
lower. The gas kinematics, using the H92 Alpha line, confirms the presence of
steep velocity gradient (26 km s^{-1} arcsec^{-1}) in the nuclear region. As
this steep gradient is observed not only on the major axis but also at large
distances along a band of PA of 150 degrees, the interpretation in terms of x2
orbits elongated along the minor axis of the bar, which would be observed at an
angle close to the inclination of the main disk, seems inadequate. Ad-hoc
radial motions must be introduced to reproduce the pattern of the velocity
field. Different families of orbits are indicated as we detect a signature in
the kinematics at the transition between the two plateaus observed in the NIR
light distribution. The H92 Alpha line also reveals the base of the outflow
where the injection towards the halo on the Northern side occurs. The
kinematical pattern suggests a connection between the gas flowing in the plane
of M82 towards the center; this behavior most likely originates due to the
presence of a bar and the outflow out of the plane.

that the magnitude of antiproton flux from PBHs in the RS braneworld is
proportional to negative power of the AdS radius, and immediately find that a

completion of the numerical studies, we show that these constraints on the AdS

some of the authors in the previous paper. Moreover, in the low accretion-rate

We find no evidence for a correlation between magnitude differences and the

whose small sample of stars is partly included in ours. Instead, by means of a
simulation we show how these differences arise naturally from the large
distances at which O stars are located, and the level of precision of the
parallax measurements achieved by Hipparcos. Straightforwardly deriving a
distance from the Hipparcos parallax yields reliable results for one or two O
stars only. We discuss several types of bias reported in the literature in
connection with parallax samples (Lutz-Kelker, Malmquist) and investigate how
they affect the O star sample. In addition, we test three absolute magnitude
calibrations from the literature (Schmidt-Kaler et al. 1982; Howarth & Prinja

measurements. Although O stars conform nicely to the simulation, we notice that

field with deep ISAAC imaging, and make an extensive comparison of their
properties with those of the extremely red galaxies (ERGs) selected in the same
field. We study in detail the evolution of Ks-selected galaxies up to redshifts
z ~ 4 and clarify the role of ERGs within the total Ks-band galaxy population.
We compute the total Ks-band luminosity function (LF) and compare its evolution
with the ERG LF. Up to <z_phot>=2.5, the bright end of the Ks-band LF shows no
sign of decline, and is progressively well reproduced by the ERGs with
increasing redshift. We also explore the evolution of massive systems present
in our sample: up to 20%-25% of the population of local galaxies with assembled
stellar mass M>1x10^11 Msun has been formed before redshift z ~ 4, and contains
  ~ 45% to 70% of the stellar mass density of the Universe at that redshift.
Within our sample, the comoving number density of these massive systems is then
essentially constant down to redshift z ~ 1.5, by which point most of them have
apparently evolved into (I-Ks)-selected ERGs. The remaining massive systems
observed in the local Universe are assembled later, at redshifts z <= 1.5. Our
results therefore suggest a two-fold assembly history for massive galaxies, in
which galaxy/star formation proceeds very efficiently in high mass haloes at
very high redshift.

Universe. We include both a thermal contribution to its relic abundance from
scatterings in the plasma and a non--thermal one from neutralino or stau decays
after freeze--out. In general both contributions can be important, although in
different regions of the parameter space. We further include constraints from
BBN on electromagnetic and hadronic showers, from the CMB blackbody spectrum
and from collider and non--collider SUSY searches. The region where the
neutralino is the next--to--lightest superpartner is severely constrained by a
conservative bound from excessive electromagnetic showers and probably
basically excluded by the bound from hadronic showers, while the stau case
remains mostly allowed. In both regions the constraint from CMB is often
important or even dominant. In the stau case, for the assumed reasonable ranges
of soft SUSY breaking parameters, we find regions where the gravitino abundance
is in agreement with the range inferred from CMB studies, provided that, in
many cases, a reheating temperature $\treh$ is large, $\treh\sim10^{9}\gev$. On
the other side, we find an upper bound $\treh\lsim 5\times 10^{9}\gev$. Less
conservative bounds from BBN or an improvement in measuring the CMB spectrum
would provide a dramatic squeeze on the whole scenario, in particular it would
strongly disfavor the largest values of $\treh\sim 10^{9}\gev$. The regions
favored by the gravitino dark matter scenario are very different from standard

gluon saturation and their impact on particle production in high-energy proton
(or deuteron)-nucleus collisions at RHIC. At central rapidity, the theory
predicts a Cronin peak due to independent multiple scattering off the valence
quarks in the nucleus. At forward rapidities, the peak flattens out and
disappears very fast, because of the correlations induced through quantum
evolution in the nuclear gluon distribution at small x. Also, the ratio R_{pA}
between the particle yield in proton-nucleus and proton-proton collisions is
rapidly suppressed when increasing the rapidity, because of saturation effects
which slow down the evolution of the nucleus compared to that of the proton.
This behaviour could be responsible for a similar trend observed in the
deuteron-nucleus collisions at RHIC.

It should be thought of as a collection of more fundamental ""microscopical""

(classical) structure must be first recognized in order to ensure a correct and
meaningful quantization procedure. In other words, we claim that the classical

This is analogous to a material medium, whose complete description does not
come from any quantized field.

vibrations of small molecules. For effective Hamiltonians with one polyad
number (approximate constant of motion), previously developed methods locate
new anharmonic modes using the critical points in the reduced classical phase
space. Theoretical arguments are given for generalizing the method to more than
one polyad number.
  The pure bending Hamiltonian of acetylene is analyzed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of critical points analysis. Four families of critical points are
born in distinct bifurcations, each corresponding to a novel anharmonic mode.
These modes are visualized with custom computer-generated animations.
  The same analysis is extended for the first time to the acetylene stretchbend
system, which has never been analyzed classically with all the resonance
couplings. Preliminary results are obtained for the polyad series containing
the C-H stretch overtones.

collective adaptation, starting from a discrete-time stochastic microscopic
model. The behavior of each agent is a dynamic balance between adaptation that
locally achieves the best action and memory loss that leads to randomized
behavior. We show that, although individual agents interact with their
environment and other agents in a purely self-interested way, macroscopic
behavior can be interpreted as game dynamics. Application to several familiar,
explicit game interactions shows that the adaptation dynamics exhibits a
diversity of collective behaviors. The simplicity of the assumptions underlying
the macroscopic equations suggests that these behaviors should be expected
broadly in collective adaptation. We also analyze the adaptation dynamics from
an information-theoretic viewpoint and discuss self-organization induced by
information flux between agents, giving a novel view of collective adaptation.

"nlin/0408040","Marc Toussaint","Marc Toussaint","Notes on information geometry and evolutionary processes",,,,,"nlin.AO cs.NE",,"  In order to analyze and extract different structural properties of
distributions, one can introduce different coordinate systems over the manifold
of distributions. In Evolutionary Computation, the Walsh bases and the Building
Block Bases are often used to describe populations, which simplifies the
analysis of evolutionary operators applying on populations. Quite independent
from these approaches, information geometry has been developed as a geometric
way to analyze different order dependencies between random variables (e.g.,
neural activations or genes).
  In these notes I briefly review the essentials of various coordinate bases
and of information geometry. The goal is to give an overview and make the
approaches comparable. Besides introducing meaningful coordinate bases,
information geometry also offers an explicit way to distinguish different order
interactions and it offers a geometric view on the manifold and thereby also on
operators that apply on the manifold. For instance, uniform crossover can be
interpreted as an orthogonal projection of a population along an m-geodesic,
monotonously reducing the theta-coordinates that describe interactions between
genes.

relevance in the formation of polarization-squeezed states of light. The light
polarization is treated in terms of four quantum Stokes parameters whose
spectra of quantum fluctuations are investigated. We show that the frequency at
which the suppression of quantum fluctuations of Stokes parameters is the
greatest can be controlled by adjusting the linear phase difference between
pulses. By varying the intensity of one pulse one can suppress effectively the
quantum fluctuations of Stokes parameters. We study the overlap of nonclassical
pulses inside of an anisotropic electronic Kerr medium and we show that the
cross-phase modulation effect can be employed to control the
polarization-squeezed state of light. Moreover, we establish that the change of
the intensity or of the nonlinear phase shift per photon for one pulse controls
effectively the squeezing of Stokes parameters. The spatial overlap of a
coherent pulse field with an interference pulse produced by mixing two
quadrature-squeezed pulses on a beam splitter is analyzed. It is found that
squeezing is produced in three of the four Stokes parameters, with the
squeezing in the first two being simultaneous.

for coherent control of quantum systems such as quantum computers. For
bounded-strength, non-Markovian environments, such as for the spin-bath that
arises in electron- and nuclear-spin based solid-state quantum computer
proposals, we show that it is strictly advantageous to use concatenated, as
opposed to standard periodic dynamical decoupling pulse sequences. Namely, the
concatenated scheme is both fault-tolerant and super-polynomially more
efficient, at equal cost. We derive a condition on the pulse noise level below
which concatenated is guaranteed to reduce decoherence.

we introduce pseudo-Hermitian position and momentum operators and a
pseudo-Hermitian quantization scheme that relates the latter to the ordinary
classical position and momentum observables. These allow us to address the
problem of determining the conserved probability density and the underlying
classical system for pseudo-Hermitian and in particular PT-symmetric quantum
systems. As a concrete example we construct the Hermitian Hamiltonian h, the
physical observables O, the localized states, and the conserved probability
density for the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric square well. We achieve this by
employing an appropriate perturbation scheme. For this system, we conduct a
comprehensive study of both the kinematical and dynamical effects of the
non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian on various physical quantities. In
particular, we show that these effects are quantum mechanical in nature and
diminish in the classical limit. Our results provide an objective assessment of
the physical aspects of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics and clarify its
relationship with both the conventional quantum mechanics and the classical
mechanics.
