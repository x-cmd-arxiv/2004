UBVRI photometry from ten different telescopes covering the phases from 7 days
before until 619 days after maximum light. Corrections for the different
instrumental systems and the non-thermal spectrum of the supernova
(S-corrections) have been applied. With the densely sampled light curves we can
make detailed comparisons to other well-observed objects. SN 2002er most
closely resembles SN 1996X after maximum, but clearly shows a different colour
evolution before peak light and a stronger shoulder in V and R bands compared
to other well-observed SNe Ia. In particular, the rise time appears to be
longer than what is expected from rise-time vs.decline-rate relation. We use
several methods to determine the reddening towards SN 2002er based on the
colour evolution at near peak and at late phases. The uvoir (bolometric) light
curve shows great similarity with SN 1996X, but also indications of a higher
luminosity, longer rise time and a more pronounced shoulder 25 days past
maximum. The interpretation of the light curves was done with two independent
light curve codes. Both find that given the luminosity of SN 2002er the 56Ni
mass exceeds 0.6 Msun with prefered values near 0.7 Msun. Uncertainties in the
exact distance to SN 2002er are the most serious limitation of this

t_rh is the initial half-mass relaxation time and t_cr is the crossing time for
a cluster in equilibrium. We show that this can be approximated accurately by
t_dis^pred ~ M_cl^0.62 for clusters in the mass range of about 10^3 to 10^6

of massive white dwarf progenitors from the zero-age main sequence through the
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and mass loss phases to the white dwarf regime.
Abundance changes are accounted for by means of a full coupling between nuclear
evolution and time-dependent mixing due to convection, salt fingers, and
diffusive overshoot. In addition, time-dependent element diffusion for
multicomponent gases has been considered during the white dwarf evolution.
Crystallization and chemical rehomogenization due to phase separation upon
crystallization in the core of our models have been fully considered. The
effects of crystallization on the period spectrum of these massive white dwarf
models are assessed by means of a detailed pulsational analysis. We find that
the theoretical pulsation spectrum is strongly modified when crystallization is
considered, in particular concerning the mode trapping properties of the
equilibrium models. We also discuss at some length the implications of our
study for BPM 37093, the most massive ZZ Ceti star presently known. We find
that if BPM 37093 has a stellar mass of $\approx 1.00$ \msun its observed

instability which terminates their growth and thickens them, resulting in a
characteristic peanut/boxy shape when viewed edge on. Using N-body simulations
of galactic disks embedded in live halos, we have analyzed the bar structure
throughout this instability and found that the outer third of the bar dissolves
completely while the inner part (within the vertical inner Lindblad resonance)
becomes less oval. The bar acquires the frequently observed peanut/boxy-shaped
isophotes. We also find that the bar buckling is responsible for a mass
injection above the plane, which is subsequently trapped by specific 3-D
families of periodic orbits of particular shapes explaining the observed
isophotes, in line with previous work. Using a 3-D orbit analysis and surfaces
of sections, we infer that the outer part of the bar is dissolved by a rapidly
widening stochastic region around its corotation radius -- a process related to
the bar growth. This leads to a dramatic decrease in the bar size, decrease in
the overall bar strength and a mild increase in its pattern speed, but is not
expected to lead to a complete bar dissolution. The buckling instability
appears primarily responsible for shortening the secular diffusion timescale to
a dynamical one when building the boxy isophotes. The sufficiently long
timescale of described evolution, ~1 Gyr, can affect the observed bar fraction
in local universe and at higher redshifts, both through reduced bar strength
and the absence of dust offset lanes in the bar.

stars which power Herbig-Haro flows and stars which do not, and to reassess the
evolutionary state of so-called protostars (Class I stars) relative to
optically revealed T Tauri stars (Class II stars). The stellar mass
distribution of Class I stars is similar to that of Class II stars and includes
3 Class I brown dwarfs. Class I stars in Taurus are slowly rotating; the
angular momentum of a young star appears to dissipate prior to the optically
revealed T Tauri phase. The mass accretion rates of Class I stars are
surprisingly indistinguishable from those of Class II stars; they do not have
accretion dominated luminosities. We confirm previous results that find larger
forbidden-line emission associated with Class I stars than Class II stars. We
suggest that this is caused by an orientation bias that allows a more direct
view of the somewhat extended forbidden emission line regions than the obscured
stellar photospheres, rather than because of larger mass outflow rates.
Overall, the similar masses, luminosities, rotation rates, mass accretion
rates, mass outflow rates, and millimeter flux densities of Class I and Class
II stars are best explained by a scenario in which most Class I stars are no
longer in the main accretion phase and are older than traditionally assumed.
Similarly, although stars which power Herbig-Haro flows appear to have larger
mass outflow rates, their stellar and circumstellar properties are generally
indistinguishable from those of stars that do not power these flows.

from pure recombination lines. This is the first time that O+ and Ne++
abundances are obtained from this kind of lines in the nebula. We have also
derived abundances from collisionally excited lines for a large number of ions
of different elements. In all cases, ionic abundances obtained from
recombination lines are larger than those derived from collisionally excited
lines. We have obtained remarkably consistent independent estimations of the
temperature fluctuations parameter, t2, from different methods, which are also
similar to other estimates from the literature. This result strongly suggests
that moderate temperature fluctuations -t2 between 0.02 and 0.03- are present
in the Orion nebula. We have compared the chemical composition of the nebula
with those of the Sun and other representative objects. The heavy element
abundances in the Orion nebula are only slightly higher than the solar ones, a
difference that can be explained by the chemical evolution of the solar
vicinity.

Finally, we conclude that the observed large-scale coherence in the orientation

understood in terms of galaxy intrinsic alignment predicted by the tidal torque

with the surrounding matter than the underlying dark halos. If applied to large

allow us to measure accurately the strength of galaxy intrinsic alignment which
plays a role of statistical error in weak lensing searches and can be used as a

in the sky around 7 degrees with a significance of around 3.3 sigma, by
cross-correlating the WMAP first-year data and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS).
In addition, we present a detailed comparison among the capabilities of three
different techniques for two different objectives: to detect the ISW and to put
constraints in the nature of the dark energy. The three studied techniques are:
the cross-angular power spectrum (CAPS, harmonic space), the correlation
function (CCF, real space) and the covariance of the Spherical Mexican Hat
Wavelet (SMHW) coefficients (CSMHW, wavelet space). We prove that the CSMHW is
expected to provide a higher detection of the ISW effect for a certain scale.
This prediction has been corroborated by the analysis of the data. The SMHW
analysis shows that the cross-correlation signal is caused neither by
systematic effects nor foreground contamination. However, by taking into
account the information encoded in all the multipoles/scales/angles, the CAPS
provides slightly better constraints than the SMHW in the cosmological
parameters that define the nature of the dark energy. The limits provided by
the CCF are wider than for the other two methods. Two different cases have been
studied: 1) a flat Lambda-CDM universe and 2) a flat universe with an equation
of state parameter different from -1. In the first case, the CAPS provides (for
a bias value of b = 1.6) 0.59 < Lambda density < 0.84 (at 1 sigma CL).
Moreover, the CAPS rejects the range Lambda density < 0.1 at 3.5 sigma, which
is the highest detection of the dark energy reported up to date. In the second
case, the CAPS gives 0.50 < dark energy density < 0.82 and -1.16 < w < 0.43 (at
1 sigma CL).

to some extent, the Hbeta absorption line display significant profile
variability in the spectra of all three stars. Data gathered during different

HD192281 and HD14442, whereas the variability pattern changes significantly
from one year to the other. The case of HD14434 is less clear as no obvious

variability, stellar rotation remains a possible clock for HD192281 and
HD14442. However, currently available models addressing stellar rotation fail
to explain some crucial aspects of the observed variability behaviour, which
appear to be even more complex in the case of HD14434.

high-redshift galaxy around z=6 because of its red i'-z' color in our deep
optical imaging survey in the Subaru Deep Field. Our follow up optical
spectroscopy reveals that this object is a strong Ly-alpha emitter with only
very faint ultraviolet continuum. The rest-frame equivalent width of the
detected Ly-alpha emission is as much as 130 A. Thus the light detected in our
z' image is largely attributed to the Ly-alpha emission, i.e., ~40% of the
z'-band flux is the strong Ly-alpha emission, giving a very red i'-z' color.
This is consistent with the photometric property of this object because the
narrow-band data obtained with the NB921 filter shows a significant depression,
z'-NB921 = -0.54 mag. By using the photometric data, we show that some other
objects among the 48 i'-dropout high-redshift galaxy candidates found in the

The frequency, the amplitude, and the duration of the pulse are varied to study
the nonlinear and cooperative character of the photoinduced transition. When

observed by plotting the final ionicity as a function of the increment of the

the neutral one with equidistant molecules after the electric field is turned

for which an electric field with frequency below the linear absorption peak is
more effective than that at the peak. When the pulse is strong and short, the
charge transfer takes place on the same time scale with the disappearance of
dimerization. As the pulse becomes weak and long, the dimerization-induced
polarization is disordered to restore the inversion symmetry on average before
the charge transfer takes place to bring the system neutral. Thus, a
paraelectric ionic phase is transiently realized by a weak electric field. It
is shown that infrared light also induces the ionic-to-neutral transition,

constructively interfere with each other if the interval is a multiple of the
period of the optical lattice vibration, while they destructively interfere if
the interval is a half-odd integer times the period, in the processes toward

interpretation of the spin precession along certain transport directions is
given. The spin precession due to the Rashba term is found to be especially
interesting since it behaves simply like a windshield wiper which is very
different from the ordinary precession while that due to the Dresselhaus term
is shown to be crystallographic-direction-dependent. Some crystallographic

governed by hamiltonian quantum dynamics. The $z$-component $\hat s_z$ of a
spin-1/2 is measured with an apparatus, which itself consists of magnet coupled
to a bath. The initial state of the magnet is a metastable paramagnet, while
the bath starts in a thermal, gibbsian state. Conditions are such that the act
of measurement drives the magnet in the up or down ferromagnetic state
according to the sign of $s_z$ of the tested spin. The quantum measurement goes
in two steps. On a timescale $1/\sqrt{N}$ the off-diagonal elements of the
spin's density matrix vanish due to a unitary evolution of the tested spin and
the $N$ apparatus spins; on a larger but still short timescale this is made
definite by the bath. Then the system is in a `classical' state, having a
diagonal density matrix. The registration of that state is a quantum process
which can already be understood from classical statistical mechanics. The von
Neumann collapse and the Born rule are derived rather than postulated.

case of homogeneous deposition. Further, the growth instability depends on the
deposition angle and direction, showing minimum at a certain deposition angle
off-normal to (001) terrace, and shows a strong correlation with the
inhomogeneous deposition flux. The increase of the growth instability is
ascribed to the strengthened step Erlich Schwoebel barrier effects that is

unconventional superconductors and it has been suggested repeatedly that
observation and analysis of these disorder effects can help to identify the
order parameter symmetry. In much of the relevant literature, including very
sophisticated calculations of interference and weak localization effects, the
disorder is represented by delta-function scatterers of arbitrary strength. One
obvious shortcoming of this approximation is that resonant scattering resulting
from the wavelength of the scattered quasiparticle matching the spatial extent
of the defect is not included. We find that the mitigation of the Tc-reduction,
expected when d-wave scattering is included, is very sensitive to the average
strength of the scattering potential and is most effective for weak scatterers.
Disorder with finite range not only has drastic effects on the predicted
density of states at low energies, relevant for transport properties, but
affects the spectral function at all energies up to the order parameter
amplitude. The gap structure, which does not appear to be of the simplest
d-wave form, should show a defect-dependent variation with temperature, which
could be detected in ARPES experiments.

  Quantum Universe""","398 pages, 9 figures. Thesis submitted to the University of
  Nottingham for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, April 2004",,,,"gr-qc quant-ph",,"  Based on a number of experimentally verified physical observations, it is
argued that the standard principles of quantum mechanics should be applied to
the Universe as a whole. Thus, a paradigm is proposed in which the entire
Universe is represented by a pure state wavefunction contained in a
factorisable Hilbert space of enormous dimension, and where this statevector is
developed by successive applications of operators that correspond to unitary
rotations and Hermitian tests. Moreover, because by definition the Universe
contains everything, it is argued that these operators must be chosen
self-referentially; the overall dynamics of the system is envisaged to be
analogous to a gigantic, self-governing, quantum computation. The issue of how
the Universe could choose these operators without requiring or referring to a
fictitious external observer is addressed.
  The processes by which conventional physics might be recovered from this
fundamental, mathematical and global description of reality are particularly
investigated. Specifically, it is demonstrated that by considering the changing
properties, separabilities and factorisations of both the state and the
operators as the Universe proceeds though a sequence of discrete computations,
familiar notions such as classical distinguishability, particle physics, space,
time, special relativity and endo-physical experiments can all begin to emerge
from the proposed picture. A pregeometric vision of cosmology is therefore
discussed, with all of physics ultimately arising from the relationships
occurring between the elements of the underlying mathematical structure.

positive depending on the choice of parameters. We discuss the physical

also. We consider the case of two or three independent variables. One
particular solution of (SE) allows us to reduce this second order equation to a
linear first order quaternionic differential equation. As in one-dimensional
case this is done with the aid of an auxiliary Riccati equation. The resulting
first order quaternionic equation is equivalent to the static Maxwell system.
In the case of two independent variables it is the Vekua equation from theory
of generalized analytic functions. We show that even in this case it is
necessary to consider not complex valued functions only, solutions of the Vekua
equation but complete quaternionic functions. Then the first order quaternionic
equation represents two separate Vekua equations, one of which gives us
solutions of (SE) and the other can be considered as an auxiliary equation of a
simpler structure. For the auxiliary equation we always have the corresponding
Bers generating pair, the base of the Bers theory of pseudoanalytic functions,
and what is very important, the Bers derivatives of solutions of the auxiliary
equation give us solutions of the main Vekua equation and as a consequence of
(SE). We obtain an analogue of the Cauchy integral theorem for solutions of

regimes of the model. In the absence of the Southern Ocean (SO) processes, i.e.
for a northern overturning cell, the volume transport is proportional to the
square root of the pressure difference. Linear scaling is seen when the
overturning is restricted entirely to the SO, i.e. when no northern downwelling
exists. For comparison, we present simulations with the coupled climate model
CLIMBER-3$\alpha$ which show linear scaling over a large regime of pressure
differences in the North Atlantic (NA). We conclude that the pycnocline model

quasi-instantaneously any change in the ocean circulation. We show that the
magnitude of this dynamic effect can locally reach up to ~1m, depending on the
initial THC strength. In some regions the rate of change can be up to 20-25
mm/yr. The emerging patterns are discussed with respect to the oceanic

have the largest possible entanglement gap; for a system consisting of two
interacting spin-1/2 subsystems, the Heisenberg antiferromagnet is one such
example. We also introduce a related concept, the entanglement-gap temperature:
the temperature below which the thermal state is certainly entangled, as
witnessed by its energy. We give an example of a bipartite Hamiltonian with an
arbitrarily high entanglement-gap temperature for fixed total energy range. For
bipartite spin lattices we prove a theorem demonstrating that the entanglement
