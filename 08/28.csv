Detection of this signal is complicated by contamination from foreground
sources such as diffuse Galactic synchrotron and free-free emission at low
radio frequencies, extragalactic free-free emission from ionized regions and
radio point sources. We model these foregrounds to determine the extent to
which 21 cm fluctuations can be detected with upcoming experiments. We find
that not only the level of correlation from one frequency to another, but also
the functional form of the foreground correlations has a substantial impact on
foreground removal. We calculate how well the angular power spectra of the 21cm
fluctuations can be determined. We also show that the large-scale bias of the
neutral Hydrogen gas distribution with respect to the density field, can be
determined with high precision and used to distinguish between different
reionization histories.

the prominent gaseous accumulations observed near the tip of some long tidal
tails are the most likely to survive long enough to form genuine recycled
galaxies. Using simple numerical models, Bournaud, Duc & Masset (2003) claimed
that tidal objects as massive as 10^9 Msun could only form, in these
simulations, within extended dark matter (DM) haloes. We present here a new set
of simulations of galaxy collisions to further investigate the structure of
tidal tails. First of all, we checked that massive objects are still produced
in full N-body codes that include feedback and a large number of particles.
Using a simpler N-body code with rigid haloes, we noticed that dissipation and
self-gravity in the tails, although important, are not the key factors.
Exploiting toy models, we found that, for truncated DM haloes, material is
stretched along the tail, while, within extended haloes, the tidal field can
efficiently carry away from the disk a large fraction of the gas, while
maintaining its surface density to a high value. This creates a density
enhancement near the tip of the tail. Only later-on, self-gravity takes over;
the gas clouds collapse and start forming stars. Thus, such objects were
fundamentally formed following a kinematical process, according to a top-down
scenario, contrary to the less massive Super Star Clusters that are also
present around mergers. This conclusion leads us to introduce a restrictive
definition for Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) and their progenitors, considering
only the most massive ones, initially mostly made of gas, that were able to
pile up in the tidal tails. More simulations will be necessary to precisely
determine the fate of these proto--TDGs and estimate their number.

a viable mechanism for the fragmentation into multiple systems -- binary stars,
brown dwarf companions, or gas giant planets -- except at periods above roughly
20,000 years. Our conclusion is based on a comparison between prior numerical
work on disk self-gravity by Gammie (2001) with our own analytical models for
the dynamical and thermal state of protostellar disks. For this purpose we
first develop a simple theory for the initial conditions of low-mass star
formation, accounting for the effect of turbulence on the characteristic mass,
accretion rate, and angular momentum of collaping cores. Second, we examine the
criterion for fragmentation to occur during star formation, concentrating on
the self-gravitational instabilities of protostellar accretion disks in their
main accretion phase. Self-gravitational instabilities are strongly dependent
on the thermal state of the disk, and we find that the combination of viscous
heating and stellar irradiation quenches fragmentation due to Toomre's local
instability. Global instability of the disk may be required to process mass
supply, but is unlikely to produce fragments. Our findings help to explain the
dearth of substellar companions to stellar type stars: the brown dwarf desert.

on the companion spectral types, we estimate their masses at 0.06, 0.20, 0.13,

archival radial velocity data, we find that the spatially resolved companion to

production of both alpha and iron-peak elements based on theoretical models for
the lifetimes and ejecta of type Ia and type II supernovae (SNe Ia and SNe II).
It is essential to include the long lifetimes of the SNIa progenitors in order
to correctly model the evolution of the iron-peak elements. We find that if all
stars form with an IMF similar to that found in the solar neighbourhood, then
the metallicities of O, Mg, Si and Fe in the ICM are predicted to be 2-3 times
lower than observed values. In contrast, a model (also favoured on other
grounds) in which stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers have a
top-heavy IMF reproduces the observed ICM abundances of O, Mg, Si and Fe. The
same model predicts ratios of ICM mass to total stellar luminosity in clusters
which agree well with observations. According to our model, the bulk of the
metals in clusters are produced by L* and brighter galaxies. [abridged]

continuum sources. The HI column density is N(HI) = 2.35 x 10^19 (T_s/f) cm^-2,
where T_s is the spin temperature and f is the continuum covering factor of the
absorbing gas. For T_s/f > 8.5 K, this system is by definition a damped Ly
alpha absorption system (N(HI) >= 2 x 10^20 cm^-2). The line is unusually
broad, with a FWHM of 53 km/s and a full span of 163 km/s, suggesting a
physically extended HI gas structure. Radio surveys identify damped Ly alpha
systems in a manner that bypasses many of the selection effects present in
optical/UV surveys, including dust extinction and the atmospheric cutoff for z
< 1.65. The smooth broad profile of this HI 21 cm absorption system is similar
to the z = 0.89 HI absorption toward PKS 1830-211, which suggests that the

absorption system. However, very long baseline interferometry and Hubble Space

due to an earlier cycle of nuclear activity. We find that inverse-Compton
losses with the cosmic microwave background radiation dominate over synchrotron
radiative losses in the lobes of all the sources, consistent with earlier
studies. We also show that prominence of the bridge emission decreases with
increasing redshift, possibly due to inverse-Compton losses. This could affect

partially filled horizontal drum. The smaller component moves toward the axis
of rotation and forms a buried core, which then splits into axial bands. Models
have generally assumed that the axial segregation is opposed by diffusion.
Using narrow pulses of the smaller component as initial conditions, we have
characterized axial transport in the core. We find that the axial advance of
the segregated core is well described by a self-similar concentration profile
whose width scales as $t^\alpha$, with $\alpha \sim 0.3 < 1/2$. Thus, the
process is subdiffusive rather than diffusive as previously assumed. We find
that $\alpha$ is nearly independent of the grain type and drum rotation rate
within the smoothly streaming regime. We compare our results to two
one-dimensional PDE models which contain self-similarity and subdiffusion; a
linear fractional diffusion model and the nonlinear porous medium equation.

the mechanism of the localization is the same in lightly Zn-doped LSCO and in

the freezing of the electrons into an inhomogeneous state, which leads to the

is a sharp distinction between the insulating color-flavor locked (CFL) phase,
which occurs where Ms^2/mu < 2 Delta, and the metallic gapless CFL phase, which
occurs at larger Ms^2/mu. Here, mu is the chemical potential for quark number
and Delta is the gap in the CFL phase. We find this distinction blurred at
nonzero T, as the CFL phase undergoes an insulator-to-metal crossover when it
is heated. We present an analytic treatment of this crossover. At higher
temperatures, we map out the phase transition lines at which the gap parameters
Delta_1, Delta_2 and Delta_3 describing ds-pairing, us-pairing and ud-pairing
respectively, go to zero in an NJL model. For small values of Ms^2/mu, we find
that Delta_2 vanishes first, then Delta_1, then Delta_3. We find agreement with
a previous Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the form of these transitions and find
quantitative agreement with results obtained in full QCD at asymptotic density
for ratios of coefficients in the Ginzburg-Landau potential. At larger Ms^2/mu,
we find that Delta_1 vanishes first, then Delta_2, then Delta_3. Hence, we find
a ""doubly critical'' point in the (Ms^2/mu,T)-plane at which two lines of
second order phase transitions (Delta_1->0 and Delta_2->0) cross. Because we do
not make any small-Ms approximation, if we choose a relatively strong coupling
leading to large gap parameters, we are able to pursue the analysis of the

We first study the spectrum using the recently extended Veneziano Yankielowicz
theory containing also the glueball states besides the gluinoball ones. Using a
simple Kahler term we show that within the effective Lagrangian approach one
can accommodate either the possibility in which the glueballs are heavier or
lighter than the gluinoball fields.
  We then provide an effective Lagrangian independent argument which allows,
using information about ordinary QCD, to deduce that the lightest states in
super Yang-Mills are the gluinoballs. This helps constraining the Kahler term
of the effective Lagrangian. Using this information and the effective

optical waveguides with the Kerr nonlinearity; the same model applies to a
fiber Bragg grating (BG) carrying two polarizations of light. We concentrate on
the case when the system's spectrum contains no true bandgap, but only
semi-gaps (which are gaps only with respect to one branch of the dispersion
relation), that nevertheless support soliton families. Solely zero-velocity
solitons were previously studied in this system, while current experiments
cannot generate solitons with the velocity smaller than half the maximum group
velocity. We find the semi-gaps for the moving solitons in an analytical form,
and demonstrated that they are completely filled with (numerically found)
solitons. Stability of the moving solitons is identified in direct simulations.
The stability region strongly depends on the frustration parameter, which
controls the difference of the present system from the usual model for the
single BG. A completely new situation is possible, when the velocity interval
for stable solitons is limited not only from above, but also from below.
Collisions between stable solitons may be both elastic and strongly inelastic.
Close to their instability border, the solitons collide elastically only if
their velocities c1 and c2 are small; however, collisions between more robust
solitons are elastic in a strip around c1=-c2.
