low-mass Asymptotic Giant Branch stars depends on certain key nuclear reaction
rates. We find from a set of complete stellar evolution calculations of a 2Msun
model with Z=0.01 including mass loss, that varying either the N14(p,g)O15 or
the 3-alpha reaction rate within their uncertainties as given in the NACRE
compilation results in dredge-up and yields that differ by a factor of 2. Model
tracks with a higher rate for the 3-alpha rate and a lower rate for the
N14(p,g)O15 reaction both show more efficient third dredge-up. New experimental
results for the N14(p,g)O15 reaction rates are surveyed, yielding a rate which
is about 40% lower than the tabulated NACRE rate, and smaller than NACRE's
lower limit. We discuss the possible implications of the revised nuclear
reaction stellar evolution calculations that aim to reproduce the observed
carbon star formation at low mass, which requires efficient third dredge-up.

allows the jammer to be subtracted from the total input vector (i.e. the jammer

main advantage of this approach to jammer nulling is that little prior

let h be a minimal homeomorphism of X. Let A be the associated crossed product
C*-algebra. We show that A has tracial rank zero whenever the image of K_0 (A)
in the affine functions on the tracial state space of A is dense. As a
consequence, we show that these crossed product C*-algebras are in fact simple
AH algebras with real rank zero. When X is connected and h is further assumed
to be uniquely ergodic, then the above happens if and only if the rotation
number associated to h has irrational values.
  By applying the classification theorem for nuclear simple C*-algebras with
tracial rank zero, we show that two such dynamical systems have isomorphic
crossed products if and only if they have isomorphic scaled ordered K-theory.

  75-80",,,"math.CO",,"  A sequence $S$ is potentially $K_{p,1,1}$ graphical if it has a realization
containing a $K_{p,1,1}$ as a subgraph, where $K_{p,1,1}$ is a complete
3-partite graph with partition sizes $p,1,1$. Let $\sigma(K_{p,1,1}, n)$ denote
the smallest degree sum such that every $n$-term graphical sequence $S$ with
$\sigma(S)\geq \sigma(K_{p,1,1}, n)$ is potentially $K_{p,1,1}$ graphical. In
this paper, we prove that $\sigma (K_{p,1,1}, n)\geq 2[((p+1)(n-1)+2)/2]$ for
$n \geq p+2.$ We conjecture that equality holds for $n \geq 2p+4.$ We prove
that this conjecture is true for $p=3$.

characteristic $p$. In this article we calculate the $\epsilon$-factor of pairs
for $\GL_l(F) \times \GL_{l'}(F)$ where $l$ and $l'$ are distinct primes
including the case $l=p$. For this calculation, we use the local Langlands
correspondence and non-Galois base change lift. This method leads to the
explicit conjecture of the $\epsilon$-factor of the representations of $\GL_m
\times \GL_n$ when $n$ is relatively prime to $m$ and $p$.

field. By definition, it measures the difference between the motive X and the
motive with compact support of X. We develop three tools to compute the
boundary motive in terms of the geometry of a compactification of X:
co-localization, invariance under abstract blow-up, and analytical invariance.
We then prove auto-duality of the boundary motive of a smooth scheme X. As a
formal consequence of this, and of co-localization, we obtain a fourth
computational tool, namely localization for the boundary motive.
