Depending on the sight line, the absorption can be identified with hot gas in
particular local structures, the Local Group (LG) or the putative local hot
intergalactic medium (IGM). Several sight lines in our sample coincide with
sight lines in a study of O VI absorption by local gas, so an assumption of

outflow velocity from each of these AGN coincides with the respective

Firstly, the 2-10 keV power-law is notably steeper. Secondly, a hard X-ray

broad emission feature is detected with the bulk of its emission redward of 6.4

explanation for the broad feature is neutral iron emission emitted from a
narrow annulus of an accretion disc close to the black hole. The hard X-ray
flare could be the mechanism which illuminates this region of the disc,
allowing for the emission line to be detected. The combination of effects can
be understood in terms of the `thundercloud' model proposed by Merloni &

environment. The Ca II and quasi-continuum are emitted by shocked SN ejecta
that underwent deformation and fragmentation in the intershock layer. Modeling
of the Ca II triplet implies that the contribution of the O I 8446 A line is
about 25% of the 8500 A feature on day 234, which permits us to recover the
flux in the Ca II 8579 A triplet from the flux of 8500 A blend reported by Deng

the electron temperature (~4400 K) in the Ca II line-emitting zone and the
ratio of the total area of dense fragments to the area of the shell, S/S_0 ~
100. We argue that Ca II bands and quasi-continuum originate from different
zones of the shocked ejecta that reflect the abundance stratification of the

this form have no instabilities at any scale, and that finite Reynolds number
suppression is not the reason for the exhibited stable behavior. While this
argument does not rule out the possibility of global hydrodynamical

pointed observations in the CO(7-6) and [CI](3P2-3P1) lines. Within, smaller

near-infrared H2 emission allows clearer determination of the physical and
chemical structure of the rho Oph photodissociation region (PDR). The
excitation conditions needed to produce the observed HCO+ and [OI] emission
directly imply inhomogeneous structure. Strong chemical gradients are observed
in HCO+ and CS; the former is ascribed to a local enhancement in the H2
ionization rate, the latter is principally due to shocks. The distribution of
[CI] is very similar to C18O, and generally consistent with illumination from
the 'far' side of the cloud. A notable exception is found at the the western
edge of the cloud, where UV photons create a PDR viewed `edge-on'. The
abundance of atomic carbon is accurately modeled using a radiation field that
decreases with increasing projected distance from the exciting star HD147889.
In contrast to conclusions of other studies, we find that no non-equilibrium

core which would otherwise have formed an intermediate or low-mass star may
form a free-floating brown dwarf or planetary-mass object, because the outer
layers of the core are eroded by the ionizing radiation from the OB star before
they can accrete onto the protostar at the centre of the core. The masses of
objects formed in this way are given approximately by $\sim 0.010 M_\odot
(a_{\rm I} / 0.3 {\rm km} {\rm s}^{-1})^6 (\dot{\cal N}_{\rm Lyc} / 10^{50}
{\rm s}^{-1})^{-1/3} (n_{\rm 0} / 10^3 {\rm cm}^{-3})^{-1/3} $, where $a_{\rm
I}$ is the isothermal sound speed in the neutral gas of the core, $\dot{\cal
N}_{\rm Lyc}$ is the rate of emission of Lyman continuum photons from the OB
star (or stars), and $n_{\rm 0}$ is the number-density of protons in the HII
region surrounding the core. We conclude that the formation of low-mass objects
by this mechanism should be quite routine, because the mechanism operates over
a wide range of conditions ($10^{50} {\rm s}^{-1} \la \dot{\cal N}_{\rm Lyc}
\la 10^{52} {\rm s}^{-1}$, $10 {\rm cm}^{-3} \la n_0 \la 10^5 {\rm cm}^{-3}$,
$0.2 {\rm km} {\rm s}^{-1} \la a_{\rm I} \la 0.6 {\rm km} {\rm s}^{-1}$) and is
very effective. However, it is also a rather wasteful way of forming low-mass
objects, in the sense that it requires a relatively massive initial core to
form a single low-mass object. The effectiveness of photo-erosion also implies
that that any intermediate-mass protostars which have formed in the vicinity of
a group of OB stars must already have been well on the way to formation before
the OB stars switched on their ionizing radiation; otherwise these protostars
would have been stripped down to extremely low mass.

weak-ferromagnetic state at around 20 T when the magnetic field is applied from
the spin easy axis (b axis), which means that there is no spin-flop transition
in the N\'eel state of this material; this is contrary to a previous report,
but is natural in light of the peculiar in-plane magnetic susceptibility
anisotropy recently found in this system. In the spin-glass state, we observe
that the large (up to \sim20%) negative MR saturates at around 40 T, and this
MR is found to be essentially isotropic when the magnetic field is rotated
within the ab plane. Our data show that the large negative MR is inherent to
LSCO in a magnetically ordered state, in which the weak-ferromagnetic (WF)
moment becomes well-defined; we discuss that the observed MR is essentially due
to the reorientation of the WF moments towards the magnetic field direction
both in the N\'eel state and in the spin-glass state.

investigated within lubrication theory. The heat flux due to evaporation
induces thermal gradients; the generated Marangoni stresses are accounted for.
Assuming the gas phase at rest, the dynamics of the vapour reduces to
diffusion. The boundary condition at the interface couples transfer from the
liquid to its vapour and diffusion flux. A non-local lubrication equation is
obtained; this non-local nature comes from the Laplace equation associated with
quasi-static diffusion. The linear stability of a flat film is studied in this
general framework. The subsequent analysis is restricted to moderately thick
films for which it is shown that evaporation is diffusion limited and that the
gas phase is saturated in vapour in the vicinity of the interface. The
stability depends only on two control parameters, the capillary and Marangoni
numbers. The Marangoni effect is destabilising whereas capillarity and
evaporation are stabilising processes. The results of the linear stability
analysis are compared with the experiments of Poulard et al (2003) performed in
a different geometry. In order to study the resulting patterns, the amplitude
equation is obtained through a systematic multiple-scale expansion. The
evaporation rate is needed and is computed perturbatively by solving the
Laplace problem for the diffusion of vapour. The bifurcation from the flat
state is found to be a supercritical transition. Moreover, it appears that the
non-local nature of the diffusion problem unusually affects the amplitude
equation.

  Accepted for publication in Journal of Physics A",,"10.1088/0305-4470/38/2/001",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  When modelling driven steady states of matter, it is common practice either
to choose transition rates arbitrarily, or to assume that the principle of
detailed balance remains valid away from equilibrium. Neither of those
practices is theoretically well founded. Hypothesising ergodicity constrains
the transition rates in driven steady states to respect relations analogous to,
but different from the equilibrium principle of detailed balance. The
constraints arise from demanding that the design of any model system contains
no information extraneous to the microscopic laws of motion and the macroscopic
observables. This prevents over-description of the non-equilibrium reservoir,
and implies that not all stochastic equations of motion are equally valid. The
resulting recipe for transition rates has many features in common with
equilibrium statistical mechanics.

statistically independent of the source, we show that in many cases (e.g, for
additive or multiplicative distortion side information) there is no penalty for
knowing the side information only at the encoder, and there is no advantage to
knowing it at the decoder. Furthermore, for quadratic distortion measures
scaled by the distortion side information, we evaluate the penalty for lack of
encoder knowledge and show that it can be arbitrarily large. In this scenario,
we also sketch transform based quantizers constructions which efficiently
exploit encoder side information in the high-resolution limit.

Schwarzschild Black Hole or another geometric background is still well-known to
be fraught with a number of delicate problems. In spherical reduction, as shown
by one of the present authors (W. K.) with D.V. Vassilevich, the correct black
body radiation follows when two ``basic components'' (conformal anomaly and a
``dilaton'' anomaly) are used as input in the integrated energy-momentum
conservation equation. The main new element in the present work is the use of a
quite different method, the covariant perturbation theory of Barvinsky and
Vilkovisky, to establish directly the full effective action which determines
these basic components. In the derivation of W. K. and D.V. Vassilevich the
computation of the dilaton anomaly implied one potentially doubtful
intermediate step which can be avoided here. Moreover, the present approach
also is sensitive to IR (renormalisation) effects. We realize that the
effective action naturally leads to expectation values in the Boulware vacuum
which, making use of the conservation equation, suffice for the computation of
the Hawking flux in other quantum states, in particular for the relevant Unruh
state. Thus, a rather comprehensive discussion of the effects of (UV and IR)
renormalisation upon radiation flux and energy density is possible.

an improved staggered action for light quarks, we are able to simulate at light
quark masses down to 1/8 of the strange mass. Consequently, the systematic
error from the chiral extrapolation is much smaller than in previous
calculations with Wilson-type light quarks. Our results for the form factors at

about fibrancy in suitable model structures. We explicitly factor a holomorphic
map between Stein manifolds through mapping cylinders in three different model
structures and use these factorizations to prove implications between
ostensibly different Oka properties of complex manifolds and holomorphic maps.
We show that for Stein manifolds, several Oka properties coincide and are
characterized by the geometric condition of ellipticity. Going beyond the Stein
case to a study of cofibrant models of arbitrary complex manifolds, using the
Jouanolou Trick, we obtain a geometric characterization of an Oka property for
a large class of manifolds, extending our result for Stein manifolds. Finally,
we prove a converse Oka Principle saying that certain notions of cofibrancy for

fundamental mechanism for adaptation that accurately explains why a broad

They are hampered by details and apply only to specific systems such as cities,

individual to imitate the actions of its neighbors and two cluster systems
yield different $\tau$ values if their component agents display different
allelomimetic tendencies. We demonstrate that allelomimetic adaptation are of

Unfortunately the model is flawed by explicit asymmetry overlooked by the
author. In addition, we show that taking into consideration stakes allows to
remove the paradoxical behaviour of Parrondo games.

  Bahar",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) of a selected mode in cytochrome c
(hemeprotein) in vacuum is studied using two theoretical approaches: One is the
equilibrium simulation approach with quantum correction factors, and the other
is the reduced model approach which describes the protein as an ensemble of
normal modes coupled with nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in
estimates of VER time (sub ps) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room
temperature, that are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's
group. The applicability of the two methods is examined through a discussion of
the validity of Fermi's golden rule on which the two methods are based.

measurement theory but control theory. It is shown that the quantum effect of
the measurement can be represented as the correlation between dynamical and
measurement noise. The transfer function representation allows us to analyze a
dynamical uncertainty relation which imposes strong constraints on the dynamics
of the linear quantum systems. In particular, quantum systems preserving the
minimum uncertainty are uniquely determined. For large spin systems, it is
shown that local dynamics are equivalent to bosonic systems. Considering global
behavior, we find quantum effects to which there is no classical counterparts.
A control problem of producing maximal entanglement is discussed as the
stabilization of a filtering process.

cope with non-individuals in a sense. A weaker equivalence relation called
``indistinguishability'' is an extension of identity in the sense that if $x$
is identical to $y$ then $x$ and $y$ are indistinguishable, although the
reciprocal is not always valid. The interesting point is that quasi-set theory
provides us a useful mathematical background for dealing with collections of
indistinguishable elementary quantum particles. In the present paper, however,
we show that even in quasi-set theory it is possible to label objects that are
considered as non-individuals. We intend to prove that individuality has
nothing to do with any labelling process at all, as suggested by some authors.
We discuss the physical interpretation of our results.

like quantal resonance-width and classical friction has been established with a
classically deterministic quantity, the stability exponent of an adiabatically
perturbed periodic orbit. This relation can be employed to estimate the rate of
energy dissipation in finite quantum systems.

asymmetry and the power launched into the Sagnac interferometer. Qualitatively,
we find good agreement between the experimental results, a semi-classical
theory and earlier numerical calculations [Schmitt etl.al., PRL Vol. 81,

it particularly well suited to applications in quantum information science.
