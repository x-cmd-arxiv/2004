  Implications",,,,,"astro-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  Recently, I showed that the ""standard model"" of solar system formation is
wrong,yielding the contradiction of terrestrial planets having insufficiently
massive cores, and showed instead the consistency of Eucken's 1944 concept of
planets raining out in the central regions of hot, gaseous protoplanets.
Planets generally consist of concentric shells of matter, but there has been no
adequate geophysical explanation to account for the Earth's non-contiguous
crustal continental rock layer, except by assuming that the Earth in the
distant past was smaller and subsequently expanded. Here, I show that formation
of Earth, from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet, will account for the
compression of the rocky Earth to about 64 percent of its current radius,
yielding a closed, contiguous continental shell with concomitant Earth
expansion commencing upon the subsequent removal of its protoplanetary gaseous
shell. I now propose that Earth expansion progresses, not from spreading at
mid-oceanic ridges as usually assumed, but primarily by the formation of
expansion cracks (often near continental margins) and the in-filling of those
cracks with basalt (produced from volume expansion in the mantle), which is
extruded mainly at mid-oceanic ridges, solidifies and traverses the ocean floor
by gravitational creep to regions of lower gravitational potential energy,
ultimately plunging downward into distant expansion cracks, emulating
subduction. Viewed from that perspective, most of the evidence presented in
support of plate tectonics supports Earth expansion; mantle convection is not
required, and the timescale for Earth expansion is no longer constrained to
about 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor.

with envelope masses of about 0.4 $M_\odot$ and 0.6 $M_\odot$, have been
constructed, and a comparison has been made of their observable properties.
Geometric pulsation of continuum-forming layers is found to be little affected
by the mass difference. The influence of molecular contamination of
near-infrared continuum bandpasses upon interferometrically measured fit
diameters ranges from undetectable to quite significant. Some pulsation cycles
of the lower-mass model Mira show substantially stronger contamination than
that found in any cycle of the higher-mass star. Observations which sample
pulsation phase well and continuously are crucial for avoiding
misinterpretations, because the assignment of absolute pulsation phases is
inherently uncertain by at least 0.1 cycles, diameter changes may be strongly
phase-dependent, and cycle-to-cycle variations may be substantial. In accord
with expectations, we find that cycle-to-cycle variations that show up in light
curves and in near-continuum diameters tend to be larger and more common in the
low-mass models, leading to one possible way to discriminate mass. Two other
methods, based on high-precision measurements of the pulsation amplitude and on
derivation of pre-maximum effective temperatures from diameter measurements,
are also discussed. High-layer features that may be strongly affected by mass
are not well described by present dust-free models.

LX < 6e40 erg/s. On the other hand, significant emission from three of the four

80a that extends on a scale of ~30 kpc perpendicular to the galactic disk,
whose X-ray temperature and luminosity were measured to be ~0.6 keV and ~4e40

powered by intense starburst activity. Based on the results, we discuss
possible reasons for the absence of diffuse X-ray emission in the HCG 80 group,
suggesting that the system is subject to galaxy interactions, and is possibly
at an early stage of IGM evolution.

explained in terms of different contributions in density distribution for

the gradient in z>5 kpc, it could not be interpreted according to the different

is possible that there is little or no gradient for z>5 kpc. The overall

an unique measurement in the linear regime of the matter power spectrum. We use
the shapelet method to estimate the shear of radio sources derived directly
from the Fourier(uv) plane. With realistic simulations we verify that the
method yields unbiased shear estimators. We quantify and correct for the
systematic effects which can produce spurious shears, analytically and with
simulations. We measure the shear correlation functions on angular scales of
0.5-40 degrees, and compute the corresponding aperture mass statistics. On 1-4
degrees scales, we find that the B-modes are consistent with zero, and detect a
lensing E-mode signal significant at the 3.0 sigma level. After removing radio
sources with an optical counterpart, the E-mode signal increases by 10-20%, as
expected for a lensing signal derived from more distant sources. We use the
E-mode measurement to constrain the mass power spectrum normalization sigma_8
and the median redshift z_m of the unidentified radio sources. We find
sigma_8*(z_m/2)^(0.6) ~ 1.0 +/- 0.2, where the 1 sigma error bars include
statistical errors, cosmic variance, and systematics. This is consistent with
earlier determinations of sigma_8, and with our current knowledge of the

analytical estimates show that the linear phase of the instability ends well
before it has converted a significant fraction of the energy in the proton beam
into magnetic energy: the conversion efficiency is much smaller (of order
m_e/m_p) in electron-proton plasmas than in pair plasmas. We find this estimate
by modelling the plasma in the shock transition zone with a waterbag momentum
distribution for the protons and with a background of hot electrons.
  For ultra-relativistic shocks we find that the wavelength of the most
efficient mode for magnetic field generation equals the electron skin depth,
that the relevant nonlinear stabilization mechanism is magnetic trapping, and
that the presence of the hot electrons limits the typical magnetic field
strength generated by this mode so that it does not depend on the energy
content of the protons. We conclude that other processes than the linear Weibel

absence was recently explained by their low mass transfer rates compared with
objects with jets. A mass accretion limit for jets in CVs was proposed to be
about 1e-7-1e-6 Mo/yr. There was, however, a report of evidence for jets in
V1494 Aql=Nova Aql 1999/2. We estimate the mass transfer rate of this system
around the reported event and show that it is consistent with the theoretical
limit for jets. We further propose that the X-ray flare that was observed in
this object may be connected with a jet as well. The appearance of jets in
novae is actually expected since during the early decline from outburst some
are alike supersoft X-ray sources, in which jets have been found. The detection
of jets in novae also fits the suggestion that in addition to the presence of
an accretion disk, a hot central source is required for the formation of jets.
The observations of jets during the transition phase in V1494 Aql can be
regarded as evidence for the early existence of the accretion disk in the
system. This conclusion supports our previous suggestion for a link between the
transition phase in novae and the re-establishment of the accretion disk. We
further speculate that jets may be restricted to transient novae. If our ideas
are confirmed, jets should be common in transient novae and may be formed
several times during the transition phase and perhaps even long after it ends.
In classical novae jets may be launched and observed in real time. As binary
systems, these objects are easy to study. Novae may, therefore, be key systems
in understanding the formation and evolution of jets and ideal targets to test
and constrain jet theories.

states (FODOS) for a series of systems with different Fermi surface and
superconducting gap structures. Instead of phenomenological Doppler-shift
method, we use an approximate analytical solution of Eilenberger equation
together with self-consistent determination of order parameter and a
variational treatment of vortex lattice. First, we compare zero-energy density
of states (ZEDOS) when a magnetic field is applied in the nodal direction
($\nu_{node}(0)$) and in the antinodal direction ($\nu_{anti}(0)$), by taking
account of the field-angle dependence of order parameter. As a result, we found
that there exists a crossover magnetic field $H^*$ so that $\nu_{anti}(0) >
\nu_{node}(0)$ for $H < H^*$, while $\nu_{node}(0) > \nu_{anti}(0)$ for $H >
H^*$, consistent with our previous analyses. Next, we showed that $H^*$ and the
shape of FODOS are determined by contribution from the small part of Fermi
surface where Fermi velocity is parallel to field-rotational plane. In
particular, we found that $H^*$ is lowered and FODOS has broader minima, when a
superconducting gap has point nodes, in contrast to the result of the
Doppler-shift method. We also studied the effects of in-plane anisotropy of
Fermi surface. We found that in-plane anisotropy of quasi-two dimensional Fermi
surface sometimes becomes larger than the effects of Doppler-shift and can
destroy the Doppler-shift predominant region. In particular, this tendency is
strong in a multi-band system where superconducting coherence lengths are
isotropic. Finally, we addressed the problem of cusp-like singularity in
YNi$_2$B$_2$C and present a possible explanation of this phenomenon.

quantitative predictions of these slowly-decaying, oscillatory indirect

inverse square of adatom-adatom separation), remarkable agreement has been
obtained with experiments by two groups. We have extended the formalism to

sum of the 3 constituent pair interactions plus the non-pairwise ""trio""
contribution, which tends to decay with the 5/2 power of perimeter. Here, we
concentrate on interactions due to ordered overlayers and to linear defects,
relating the latter to the interactions of (nx1) ordered overlayers and to the
constituent pair interactions. We compare with experimental studies of
interactions of adatoms with adchains and of consequent 1D motion of adatoms
trapped between two such parallel chains. We discuss implications for step-step

applied to the study of uniaxial and equi-biaxial tension (compression), where
the stress--strain diagrams are analyzed numerically. It is demonstrated that
intra-chain interactions (i) cause an increase in the Young's modulus of the
network and (ii) induce the growth of stresses (compared to an appropriate
network of Gaussian chains), which becomes substantial at relatively large
elongation ratios. The effect of excluded-volume interactions on the elastic
response strongly depends on the deformation mode, in particular, it is more
pronounced at equi-biaxial tension than at uniaxial elongation.

mass can be as large as a few hundred GeV (200 - 300 GeV) while the successful
MSSM prediction for gauge coupling unification is preserved. The theories are
formulated on a 5D warped space truncated by two branes, and a part of the
Higgs sector is localized on the infrared brane. The structure of the Higgs
sector in the four dimensional effective theory below the Kaluza-Klein mass
scale is essentially that of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model
(NMSSM), or related theories. However, large values of the NMSSM couplings at
the weak scale are now possible as these couplings are required to be
perturbative only up to the infrared cutoff scale, which can in general be much
lower than the unification scale. This allows the possibility of generating a
large quartic coupling in the Higgs potential, and thereby significantly
raising the Higgs-boson mass bound. We present two particularly simple models.
In the first model, the quark and lepton fields are localized on the
ultraviolet brane, where the grand unified symmetry is broken. In the second
model, the quark and lepton fields are localized on the infrared brane, and the
unified symmetry is broken both on the ultraviolet and infrared branes. Our
theories potentially allow the possibility of a significant reduction in the
fine-tuning needed for correct electroweak symmetry breaking, although this is
somewhat model dependent.

constant brane tension) there is a continuum of normalizable Kaluza-Klein

m=\sqrt{2}H, satisfies the boundary conditions for two branes but is not
normalizable in the single-brane case. When matter is introduced (as a test

condition requires the self-consistent 4-dimensional evolution of scalar field
perturbations on the brane and the dangerous growing modes are not excited.
These normalizable discrete modes introduce corrections at first-order to the

the exact construction of the Green functions for the wave, heat, and
Schrodinger problems with a Robin boundary condition. The resulting physical
picture is that the field can exchange energy with the boundary, and a delayed
reflection from the boundary results. In more general situations the method
allows at least approximate and local construction of the appropriate reflected
solutions, and hence a ""classical path"" analysis of the Green functions and the

an evoloved quantum state with the same evoloved by a slightly perturbed

with respect to small perturbations. It is believed to have significantly
different behavior in time when the underlying classical motion is chaotic or
regular. Starting with suitable initial quantum states, we develop a
semiclassical estimate of this quantum fidelity in the Linear Response
framework (appropriate for the small perturbation regime), assuming some

Happel's conjecture. They found a family of pathological algebra $A_q$ for

many aspects, however their Hochschild homology behaviors are not pathological
any more, indeed one has $\hh A_q = \infty=\gl A_q$. This suggests to pose a
seemingly more reasonable conjecture by replacing Hochschild cohomology
dimension in Happel's conjecture with Hochschild homology dimension: $\gl A <
\infty$ if and only if $\hh A < \infty$ if and only if $\hh A = 0$. The
conjecture holds for commutative algebras and monomial algebras. In case $A$ is

applied to the model of a passive scalar quantity advected by a non-Gaussian
velocity field with finite correlation time. The velocity is governed by the
Navier--Stokes equation, subject to an external random stirring force with the
correlation function $\propto \delta(t-t') k^{4-d-2\epsilon}$. It is shown that
the scalar field is intermittent already for small $\epsilon$, its structure
functions display anomalous scaling behavior, and the corresponding exponents
can be systematically calculated as series in $\epsilon$. The practical
calculation is accomplished to order $\epsilon^{2}$ (two-loop approximation),
including anisotropic sectors. Like for the well-known Kraichnan's rapid-change
model, the anomalous scaling results from the existence in the model of
composite fields (operators) with negative scaling dimensions, identified with
the anomalous exponents. Thus the mechanism of the origin of anomalous scaling
appears similar for the Gaussian model with zero correlation time and
non-Gaussian model with finite correlation time. It should be emphasized that,
in contrast to Gaussian velocity ensembles with finite correlation time, the
model and the perturbation theory discussed here are manifestly Galilean
covariant. The relevance of these results for the real passive advection,
comparison with the Gaussian models and experiments are briefly discussed.

the classical capacity) of infinite dimensional quantum channels. An essential
feature of this case is the natural appearance of the input constraints and
infinite, in general, ``continuous'' state ensembles, defined as probability
measures on the set of all quantum states. By using compactness criteria from
probability theory and operator theory it is shown that the set of all
generalized ensembles with the average (barycenter) in a compact set of states
is itself a compact subset of the set of all probability measures. With this in
hand we give a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal generalized
ensemble for a constrained quantum channel. This condition can be verified in
the case of Bosonic Gaussian channels with constrained mean energy. The
importance of the above condition is shown by considering example of a
constrained channel with no optimal generalized ensemble. In the case of convex
constraints a characterization of the optimal generalized ensemble is obtained
extending the `` maximal distance'' property.

eavesdropper to sift the information gathered by tapping the quantum channel
reduces the amount of information that an eavesdropper can gain on the sifted

allows the growing of a secret key.
