Cluster Survey, a deep sample of serendipitous X-ray selected clusters of
galaxies based on the ROSAT HRI archive. This is the first cluster catalog
exploiting the high angular resolution of this instrument. Cluster candidates
are selected on the basis of their X-ray extension only, a parameter which is
well measured by the BMW wavelet detection algorithm. The survey includes 154
candidates over a total solid angle of ~160 deg2 at 10^{-12}erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}
and ~80 deg^2 at 1.8*10^{-13} erg s^{-1}$ cm^{-2}. At the same time, a fairly
good sky coverage in the faintest flux bins (3-5*10^{-14}erg s^{-1} cm^{-2})
gives this survey the capability to detect a few clusters with z\sim 1-1.2,
depending on evolution. We present the results of extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, providing a complete statistical characterization of the survey
selection function and contamination level. We also present a new estimate of
the surface density of clusters of galaxies down to a flux of 3*10^{-14}erg
s^{-1} cm^{-2}, which is consistent with previous measurements from PSPC-based
samples. Several clusters with redshifts up to z=0.92 have already been
confirmed, either by cross-correlation with existing PSPC surveys or from early
results of an ongoing follow-up campaign. Overall, these results indicate that
the excellent HRI PSF (5 arcsec ~FWHM on axis) more than compensates for the
negative effect of the higher instrumental background on the detection of
high-redshift clusters. In addition, it allows us to detect compact clusters
that could be lost at lower resolution, thus potentially providing an important
new insight into cluster evolution.

triaxial potentials resembling CDM halos. Our analysis focuses on the accuracy
of the dark mass distribution inferred from rotation curves derived from
simulated long-slit spectra. We consider a massless disk embedded in a halo
with axis ratios of 0.5:0.6:1.0 and with its rotation axis aligned with the
minor axis of the halo. Closed orbits for the gaseous particles deviate from
coplanar circular symmetry, resulting in a variety of long-slit rotation curve
shapes, depending on the orientation of the disk relative to the line of sight.
Rotation curves may thus differ significantly from the spherically-averaged
circular velocity profile of the dark matter halo. ""Solid-body"" rotation
curves--typically interpreted as a signature of a constant density core in the
dark matter distribution--are obtained about 25% of the time for random
orientations although the dark matter follows the cuspy density profile
proposed by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW). We conclude that the discrepancies
reported between the shape of the rotation curve of low surface brightness
galaxies and the structure of CDM halos may be resolved once the complex
effects of halo triaxiality on the dynamics of the gas component is properly
taken into account.

to Type-I PNe for He and N/O but significantly deficient in oxygen. The nebula
has been further modelled using both photoionization (CLOUDY) and shock
(MAPPINGS) codes. From the photoionization modelling of the core, we find that
both the strong auroral [O III] 4363A and [N II] 5755A emission lines observed

density is adopted. We suggest that a strong density stratification, matching
the high-density core detected at radio wavelengths and the much lower density
of the optical core, might solve the problem. From the bow-shock modelling of
the knots, on the other hand, we find that knots' chemistry is also represented
by Type-I PN abundances, and that they would move with velocities of 250 - 300

in the continuum at 408 MHz (S_{408} = 120 +/- 30 mJy) and 1.4 GHz (S_{1400} =
79 +/- 3 mJy). The HI structure of UGCA 86 is complex, with two separate
components: a rotating disk and a highly elongated spur that is kinematically
disjunct from the disk. The HI disk is centered on the optical galaxy with
similar axial ratio and orientation of the major axis. An area of the disk with
a peculiar velocity of 25 km/s relative to the regular rotation of the disk is
found on the southern side, where most of the star formation is concentrated.
The spur is seen along the minor axis of UGCA 86 and overlaps in part with the
disk. Towards the optical center of UGCA 86, the velocity difference between
the spur and the disk is 40 km/s, about one third of the rotation velocity of
the HI disk at 6 kpc from the center. This implies a large radial component of
the orbital velocity of the spur, and therefore a significantly non-circular
orbit. The velocity dispersion of the disk is 8.8 km/s, whereas the velocity
dispersion of the spur varies from 10 km/s to 30 km/s. A possible tidal origin
of the spur is considered in view of the proximity of the large Scd galaxy IC
342. However, evidence that the spur is located far outside the plane of the HI
disk, and the absence of evidence for a warp in the outer HI disk, poses a
problem for the interpretation of the spur as a tidal tail induced by IC 342.
Detailed modelling of the IC 342/UGCA 86 system will be required before a tidal
origin of the spur can be dismissed conclusively. The possibility that the spur
is part of the nascent cloud of UGCA 86 or the remains of a small dwarf galaxy
is presented as an alternative interpretation.

varies from a few tenth of meV in the case of Si QW channels to several meV for
the Ge counterparts, and can be modified efficiently by gate-controlled
variation of the perpendicular confining electric field. The analysis also
shows that for sufficiently asymmetric QWs, spin relaxation is due mainly to
the spin-splitting related D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. In strained Si QWs, our

hundred picoseconds at room temperature, suggesting that such structures are

attracts many PCs to form a complex. When the ratio of total charges of PA and
PC in the solution, $x$, equals to 1, complexes are neutral and they condense
in a macroscopic drop. When $x$ is far away from 1, complexes are strongly
charged. The Coulomb repulsion is large and free complexes are stable. As $x$
approaches to 1, PCs attached to PA disproportionate themselves in two
competing ways. One way is inter-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make
some complexes neutral and therefore condensed in a macroscopic drop while
other complexes become even stronger charged and stay free. The other way is
intra-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make one end of a complex
neutral and condensed in a small droplet while the rest of the complex forms a
strongly charged tail. Thus each complex becomes a ""tadpole"". These two ways
can also combine together to give even lower free energy. We get a phase
diagram of PA-PC solution in a plane of $x$ and inverse screening radius of the

glass. The phase transition as a function of temperature is second order for
all values of disorder. We use finite size scaling to determine the transition
temperature T_C and the critical exponent nu. We find that T_C decreases and
that nu increases with increasing disorder. We also observe changes in the
specific heat, the single particle density of states, and the staggered
occupation as a function of disorder and temperature.

investigate details of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Such investigations can

sufficient condition for this equality is that the set of the k_{n}'s be equal
to the set of square-free numbers. Numerical evidence seems to support both
conjectures. Anyway, we think that these sequences are interesting by itself
because our construction not only generates square-free (hence prime) numbers
k, but also the value of the Mobius function at k. Our definition is
independent of the square-free numbers and the Mobius function, with the
k_{i}'s arising as discontinuity points of the A_{i}'s. As for the case of
B_{n}, we prove that sequence A_{n} is not convergent to -1 in L^{2}([0,1],dx).
Consequently, we focus our analysis not on L^{2} norm analysis but other
integral properties. This procedure seems to be useful to elucidate the lack of
L^{2} convergence for step Beurling functions.

is found. It is shown that there are only causal propagations of waves in the
approach considered.
