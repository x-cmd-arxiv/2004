produced by ultra-relativistic jets of ordinary matter which are ejected in
core collapse supernova (SN) explosions. Such jets are extremely efficient
cosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient
particles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet
kinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to
produce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful
cannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,
which produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main
origin of cosmic rays at all energies. The model explains very simply the
elemental composition of CRs and their observed spectra at all energies. In
particular it explains the origin of the CR knees and ankle. Above the CR
ankle, the Galactic magnetic fields can no longer delay the free escape of
ultra-high energies CRs (UHECR) from the Galaxy, and the CRs from the
intergalactic medium (IGM), which were injected there by SN jets from all the
galaxies and isotropized there by the IGM magnetic fields, dominate the
Galactic CR spectrum. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect due to the
interaction of UHECRs with the microwave background radiation is expected. The
CR nuclei which diffuse out of galaxies, or are directly deposited in the IGM
by the relativistic SN jets, may be the origin of the IGM magnetic fields.
Inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR)
by the CR electrons in the IGM produces the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray
background radiation (GBR).

resembling thermal disc emission. Calculations based on blackbody emission then
indicate that the accreting black holes at the centres of these discs have
masses of 100s to 1000s Msun. Establishing the existence of such intermediate
mass black holes is of considerable importance so the assumptions and
approximations lying behind blackbody spectral fits must be examined. We study
here the basic assumption that the thermal emission is well-characterised by a
multi-temperature blackbody spectrum. Since the opacity in the surface layers
of a disc decreases at high energies the emergent spectrum is hardened. We
compute the observed spectra from discs around a non-spinning 1000 Msun black
hole and fit them over the XMM-Newton pn band with multi-colour disc models.
The typical overall spectra hardening factor usually adopted for discs around
stellar mass black hole (assuming an inclination of 60 deg and including
relativistic effects for a non-spinning black hole) is found to be appropriate.

redshifted and not gravitationally redshifted, when observed on Earth. Quantum
mechanical effects cause the photons' gravitational redshift to be reversed as
the photons move from the Sun to the Earth. The designs of the experiments,
which were thought to have proven the gravitational redshift of photons, are
all in the domain of classical physics, and make it impossible to detect the
reversal of the gravitational redshifts. The solar redshift experiments,
however, are in the domain of quantum mechanics; and the reversal of the
redshift is easily detected, when the plasma redshift is taken into account.
The photons are found to be weightless relative to a local observer, but
repelled relative to a distant observer. The weightlessness of the photons in
the gravitational field relative to a local observer is inconsistent with
Einstein's equivalence principle. This together with the plasma redshift has
profound consequences for the cosmological perspectives. This article gives a
theoretical explanation of the observed phenomena, proper interpretation of the
many gravitational redshift experiments, and an understanding of how we missed
observing the reversal of photons' gravitational redshift. The present analysis
indicates that although the photons are weightless in a local system of
reference, the experimental evidence indicates that quasi-static
electromagnetic fields are not weightless, but adhere to the principle of
equivalence.

consider the resulting polarization of the redshifted 21 cm background from the
intergalactic medium before reionization. The polarization is detectable in
regions with a strong gradient in the mean brightness temperature. In
principle, this can open a new window on the evolution of intergalactic
magnetic fields. One possible approach is an extended integration of an
individual target during this era, such as the Mpc-scale HII regions inferred
to surround quasars at z ~ 6.5. The differential intensity between the two
polarization states can be used as a probe of the magnetic field at the edge of
the HII region. We estimate that the SKA could (ignoring systematics) detect B
\~ 200 (10) \muG coherent over several kiloparsecs with an observational
bandwidth of 100 (2) kHz. Beyond individual sources, the statistical properties
of wide-field 21 cm polarization maps, such as the angular power spectrum, can
be used to constrain the large-scale magnetic field. In this case, the SKA can
detect $B \sim 100 \mu$G fields coherent over many megaparsecs. The magnetic
field can be measured in any epoch over which the 21 cm background changes
rapidly (for example because the ionized fraction or spin temperature change).
Although the resulting constraints with SKA are relatively weak compared to

After reviewing the basics of measuring distances of cosmological sources,
various distance definitions are used to calculate the differential density

distribution in the Einstein-de Sitter cosmology. The main results are as
follows: (1) the choice of distance plays a crucial role in determining the
scale where relativistic corrections must be taken into account, as both
$\gamma$ and $\gamma^\ast$ are strongly affected by such a choice; (2)
inappropriate distance choices may lead to failure to find evidence of a galaxy
fractal structure when one calculates those quantities, even if such a
structure does occur in the galaxy distribution; (3) the comoving distance and
the distance given by Mattig's formula are unsuitable to probe for a possible
fractal pattern as they render $\gamma$ and $\gamma^\ast$ constant for all
redshifts; (4) a possible galaxy fractal system at scales larger than 100Mpc (z

luminosity or redshift distances, as they are the ones where $\gamma$ and
$\gamma^\ast$ decrease at higher redshifts; (5) C\'el\'erier and Thieberger's

computed for metallicities $Z$ ranging from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC) to that of the Galactic Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the
rotational mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by rotation are
included. The evolution of the surface rotational velocities of the most
massive O--stars mainly depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial
$Z$ value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the Wolf--Rayet
(WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all metallicities, rotating stars enter
the WR phase at an earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are
increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of the eWNL phase.
Models of WR stars predict in general rather low rotation velocities ($ < 50$
km s$^{-1}$) with a few possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities
lower than solar where WR star models have in general faster rotation and more
chance to reach the break--up limit.The properties of the WR populations as

the observations in nearby galaxies. The observed variation with metallicity of
the fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II supernovae as

problem on multi-resolution grids. If the cloud model is from an MHD simulation
on a regular cartesian grid, criteria based for example on local density or

sub-cells. Division can be repeated hierarchically. Alternatively, if the cloud
model is from an MHD simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, the same
multi-resolution grid used for the MHD simulation is adopted in the radiative
transfer calculations. High discretization is often needed only in a small
fraction of the total volume. This makes it possible to simulate spectral line
maps with good accuracy, also minimizing the total number of cells and the
computational cost (time and memory). Multi-resolution models are compared with
models on regular grids. In the case of moderate optical depths (tau ~ a few)
an accuracy of 10% can be reached with multi-resolution models where only 10%
of the cells of the full grid are used. For optically thick species (tau~100),
the same accuracy is achieved using 15% of the cells. The relation between

between LTE and non-LTE spectra and between isothermal and non-isothermal cloud

line profiles of the isothermal and LTE models relative to the more realistic

bodies. Although this derivation is of purely mathematical nature and without
any assumption, it is shown, in the Appendix, that, physically, trapped
surfaces do not form in order that the 3 speed of the fluid as measured by an
observer at a fixed circumference coordinate $R$ (a scalar), is less than the
speed of light $c$. The consequence of this result is that, mathematically,
even if there would be Schwarzschild Black Holes, they would have unique
gravitational mass M=0. Recall that Schwazschild BHs may be considered as a
special case of rotating Kerr BHs with rotation parameter a=0. If one would
derive the Boyer-Lindquist metric [1] in a straight forward manner by using the
Backlund transformation[2], one would obtain a= M sin phi where phi is the
azimuth angle. This relation demands that BHs have unique mass M=0 (along with
a=0) which in turn confirms that there cannot be any trapped surface in
realistic gravitational collapse where the fluid has real pressure and density.

forming only low mass stars. According to the CO line ratios the abundances and
physical conditions could be similar to that of cold gas in spirals. We find
from its dynamics (no rotation) and its mass (2--6 million solar masses) that
it resembles a massive GMC. Also, re-inspecting N-body simulations of the M81

host stars. This may lead to a reduction of the planetary orbit and a spin-up
of stellar rotation. Tidal interactions have been computed for a number of
extrasolar planets in circular orbits within 0.06 AU, namely for OGLE-TR-56 b.
We compare our range of the tidal dissipation value with two dissipation models
from Sasselov (2003) and conclude that our choices are equivalent to these
models. However, applied to the planet OGLE-TR-56 b, we find in contrast to
Sasselov (2003) that this planet will spiral-in toward the host star in a few
billion years. We show that the average and maximum value of our range of
dissipation are equivalent to the linear and quadratic dissipation models of
Sasselov (2003). Due to limitations in the observational techniques, we do not
see a possibility to distinguish between the two dissipation models as outlined
by Sasselov (2003). OGLE-TR-56 b may therefore not serve as a test case for
dissipation models. The probable existence of OGLE-TR-3 b at 0.02 AU and the
discovery of OGLE-TR-113 b at 0.023 AU and OGLE-TR-132 b at 0.03 AU may also
counter Sasselovs (2003) assumption of a pile-up stopping boundary at 0.04 AU.

the X-ray spectrum and luminosity of the Mira AB system more closely resemble
those of late-type, pre-main sequence stars or late-type, magnetically active

that X-rays from the Mira AB system arise either from magnetospheric accretion
of wind material from Mira A onto Mira B, or from coronal activity associated
with Mira B itself, as a consequence of accretion-driven spin-up. One (or both)
of these mechanisms also could be responsible for the recently discovered,
point-like X-ray sources within planetary nebulae.

This contribution extends previous work on the nonresonant response to include
the mixed and resonant contributions. We focus our attention on the spinless
Falicov-Kimball model, where the problem can be solved exactly, and the system
can be tuned to go through a Mott-Hubbard-like metal-insulator transition.
Resonant effects vary in different scattering geometries, corresponding to the
symmetries of the charge excitations scattered by the light. We do find that
the Raman response is large near the double resonance, where the transfered
frequency is close to the incident photon frequency. We also find a joint
resonance of both the charge-transfer peak and the low-energy peak when the
incident photon frequency is on the order of the interaction strength. In
general, the resonance effects can create order of magnitude (or more)
enhancements of features in the nonresonant response, especially when the
incident photon frequency is somewhat larger than the frequency of the
nonresonant feature. Finally, we find that the resonant effects also exhibit
isosbestic behavior, even in the A1g and B2g sectors, and it is most prominent
when the incident photon frequency is on the order of the interaction energy.

analyzed for different size asymmetries by starting from the exact low-density
expansion of the pressure. Already within the second virial approximation the
fluid separates into two phases of different composition with a lower consolute
critical point. By successively incorporating the third, fourth, and fifth
virial coefficients, the critical consolute point moves to higher values of the
pressure and to lower values of the partial number fraction of the large
spheres. When the exact low-density expansion of the pressure is rescaled to
higher densities as in the Percus-Yevick theory, by adding more exact virial
coefficients a different qualitative movement of the critical consolute point
in the phase diagram is found. It is argued that the Percus-Yevick factor
appearing in many empirical equations of state for the mixture has a deep
influence on the location of the critical consolute point, so that the
resulting phase diagram for a prescribed equation has to be taken with caution.

network (Localization) is of fundamental importance in sensor networks.
Interpretating data from sensors will not be possible unless the context of the
data is known; this is most often accomplished by tracking its physical
location. Existing research has focused on localization in static sensor
networks where localization is a one-time (or low frequency) activity. In
contrast, this paper considers localization for mobile sensors: when sensors
are mobile, localization must be invoked periodically to enable the sensors to
track their location. The higher the frequency of localization, the lower the
error introduced because of mobility. However, localization is a costly
operation since it involves both communication and computation. In this paper,
we propose and investigate adaptive and predictive protocols that control the
frequency of localization based on sensor mobility behavior to reduce the
energy requirements for localization while bounding the localization error. We
show that such protocols can significantly reduce the localization energy
without sacrificing accuracy (in fact, improving accuracy for most situations).
Using simulation and analysis we explore the tradeoff between energy efficiency
and localization error due to mobility for several protocols.

as a cylinder introduced by Friedrich are used to analyse the behaviour of the
gravitational field near null and spatial infinity for the development of data
which are asymptotically Euclidean, conformally flat and time asymmetric. Our
analysis allows for initial data whose second fundamental form is more general
than the one given by the standard Bowen-York Ansatz. The Conformal Einstein
equations imply upon evaluation on the cylinder at spatial infinity a hierarchy
of transport equations which can be used to calculate in a recursive way
asymptotic expansions for the gravitational field. It is found that the the
solutions to these transport equations develop logarithmic divergences at
certain critical sets where null infinity meets spatial infinity. Associated to
these, there is a series of quantities expressible in terms of the initial data
(obstructions), which if zero, preclude the appearance of some of the
logarithmic divergences. The obstructions are, in general, time asymmetric.
That is, the obstructions at the intersection of future null infinity with
spatial infinity are different, and do not generically imply those obtained at
the intersection of past null infinity with spatial infinity. The latter allows
for the possibility of having spacetimes where future and past null infinity
have different degrees of smoothness. Finally, it is shown that if both sets of
obstructions vanish up to a certain order, then the initial data has to be
asymptotically Schwarzschildean to some degree.

improved gluon action was used, which allows simulations to be done on coarse

separations and long propagation times at which string breaking occurs. The
static sources were generated using Wilson loop operators, hence no light
valence quarks are present in the resulting trial states. Results give
unambiguous evidence of string breaking. First the static potential is shown to
saturate at twice the heavy-light meson mass at large separations. Then it is
demonstrated that the local color-electric field strength in the region between

thermo-dynamical approach) is a well suited framework for this purpose.The

Semiclassical (QFT) and quantum gravity (String) phases or regimes are properly
determined (back reaction effects included). The Hawking-Gibbons temperature
${T_H}$ of the semiclassical regime becomes the intrinsic string temperature
${T_S}$ in the quantum gravity regime.The spectrum of black hole evaporation is
an incomplete gamma function of $(T_S - T_H)$: the early evaporation is thermal
(Hawking radiation), while at the end the black hole undergoes a phase
transition to a string state decaying (as string decay) into pure (non mixed)
particle states.Remarquably, explicit dynamical computations show that both
gravity regimes: semiclassical (QFT) and quantum (string), are dual of each

it yields exact wavefunction renormalization and correct $(\alpha \xi)$ terms

of analytic functions. We then LKF transform this result to obtain the

is shown that contrary to the usual theory based on the inhomogeneous Maxwell's

no divergence in the self-interaction so that the mass is finite, and that the
only approximation made in the derivation are the usual conditions required for
the internal consistency of classical electrodynamics. Moreover, it is found

symmetric trace-free 2-tensor on even-dimensional Riemannian and
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The conformal deformation complex is a
differential complex related to infinitesimal deformations of conformal
structure. We construct a conformally invariant differential operator on
algebraic Weyl tensors that gives special curved analogues of certain operators
related to the deformation complex and that, upon application to the Weyl
curvature, yields the obstruction tensor. This new definition of the
obstruction tensor leads to simple direct proofs that the obstruction tensor is
divergence free and vanishes for a class of metrics which (strictly) includes
the class of conformally Einstein metrics. Our main constructions are based on
the ambient metric of Fefferman-Graham and its relation to the conformal
tractor connection. We prove that the obstruction tensor is an obstruction to
the formal problem of obtaining a Ricci-flat ambient metric and that it may
equivalently be viewed as the obstruction to finding an ambient metric with
curvature harmonic for a certain (ambient) form Laplacian. This leads to a new

the FIC (Fibered Isomorphism Conjecture for pseudoisotopy functor) for a
particular class of 3-manifolds (we denoted this class by \cal C) is the key to
prove the FIC for 3-manifold groups in general. And we proved the FIC for the
fundamental groups of members of a subclass of \cal C. This result was obtained
by showing that the double of any member of this subclass is either Seifert
fibered or supports a nonpositively curved metric. In this article we prove
that for any M in {\cal C} there is a closed 3-manifold P such that either P is
Seifert fibered or is a nonpositively curved 3-manifold and \pi_1(M) is a
subgroup of \pi_1(P). As a consequence this proves that the FIC is true for any
B-group (see definition 3.2 in \cite{R3}). Therefore, the FIC is true for any
Haken 3-manifold group and hence for any 3-manifold group (using the reduction
theorem of \cite{R3}) provided we assume the Geometrization conjecture. The
above result also proves the FIC for a class of 4-manifold groups (see
\cite{R2}(math.GT/0209119)).
  The second aspect of this article is to relax a condition in the definition
of strongly poly-surface group (\cite{R1} (math.GT/0209118)) and define a new
class of groups (we call them {\it weak strongly poly-surface} groups). Then
using the above result we prove the FIC for any virtually weak strongly
poly-surface group. We also give a corrected proof of the main lemma of
\cite{R1}.

  Volume VI, pages A-1 to A-82",,"Independent Scientific Research Institute report number ISRI-04-06","physics.hist-ph physics.class-ph",,"  The thesis developed by Cornelius Lanczos in his doctoral dissertation is
that electrodynamics is a pure field theory which is hyperanalytic over the
algebra of biquaternions. In this theory Maxwell's homogeneous equations
correspond to a generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann regularity conditions to
four complex variables, and electrons to singularities in the Maxwell field.
Since there are no material particles in Lanczos electrodynamics, the same
action principle applies to both regular and singular Maxwell fields.
Therefore, the usual action integral of classical electrodynamics is {not} an
input in that theory, but rather a consequence which {derives} from the
application of Hamilton's principle to a superposition of two or more
homogeneous Maxwell fields. This leads to a fully consistent electrodynamics
which, moreover, can be shown to be finite. As byproducts to this remarkable
thesis Lanczos anticipated the Moisil-Fueter theory of quaternion-analytic
functions by more than ten years; showed that Maxwell's equations are invariant
in both spin-1 and spin-1/2 Lorentz transformations; that displacing a
singularity into imaginary space adds an intrinsic magnetic-like field to its
electric field; and that his theory does even include gravitation -- although
not in the general relativistic form of Einstein to whom Lanczos dedicated his
dissertation.

field lines hitting the wall in some specified region. We divide the tokamak
wall into three areas of equal poloidal angular length, corresponding to
different exits for a chaotic field line. In order to obtain the exit basins we
used a fine grid chosen inside a small rectangle which comprises a
representative part of the chaotic region near the wall. Thus, exit basins were
obtained for a tokamak wall with reversed magnetic shear. The nontwist mapping
describes the perturbed magnetic field lines with two twin chains of magnetic

chromosomes. Contrary to the classical result that DNA coding regions of
bacterial genomes are purely uncorrelated random sequences, here it is shown,
via a renormalization group approach, that DNA random fluctuations of single
bases are modulated by log-periodic variations. Distance series of triplets
display long-range correlations in each half of the intact chromosome and in
intronless protein-coding sequences, or both long-range correlations and
log-periodic modulations along the whole chromosome. Hence scaling analyses of

  Green Functions in Real Time","16 pages, no figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The electric conductance of a molecular junction is calculated by recasting
the Keldysh formalism in Liouville space. Dyson equations for nonequilibrium
many body Green's functions (NEGF) are derived directly in real (physical)
time. The various NEGFs appear naturally in the theory as time ordered products
of superoperators, while the Keldysh forward/backward time loop is avoided.

  logarithm problem","13 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper, we first define the quantum discrete logarithm problem
(QDLP)which is similar to classical discrete logarithm problem. But, this
problem cannot be solved by Shor's quantum algorithm. Based on quantum discrete
logarithm problem, we present a novel quantum secret key encryption algorithm.
The receiver constructs his quantum channel using their secret key. Then, the
sender can use the receiver's quantum channel to encrypt the message. Finally,
the receiver dencrypts the ciphertext by using secret key. In our algorithm,
the quantum system will be broken after transferring messages. But, the secret
key can still be used repeatedly in our algorithm.

interpretation of quantum mechanics in which the observer plays no fundamental
role. Bohmian mechanics describes, instead of probabilities of measurement
results, objective microscopic events. In recent years, Bohmian mechanics has
attracted increasing attention by researchers. The form of a dialogue allows me
to address questions about the Bohmian view that often arise.
