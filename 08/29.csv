Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). The spectra of these objects are defined by strong
hydrogen Balmer absorption lines (H-delta, H-gamma, H-beta) combined with a
lack of [OII] 3727A emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst of
star formation. The E+A spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the process
of evolution. We quantify the local environments, clustering properties and
luminosity function of the E+A galaxies. We find that the environments are
consistent with the ensemble of 2dFGRS galaxies: low-redshift E+A systems are
located predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poor
groups. However, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using three
Balmer absorption lines H-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.
Indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (E/S0)
systems. In a small but significant number we find evidence for recent major
mergers, such as tidal tails. We infer that major mergers are one important
formation mechanism for E+A galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. At low
redshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thus
these recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usual
morphology-density relation for ellipticals. Regarding the selection of E+A
galaxies: we find that basing the Balmer-line criterion solely on H-delta
absorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems with
detectable H-alpha emission. In these objects the [OII] emission is presumably
either obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the
(H-gamma, H-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

examining the far-infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution (SED)
and properties of dust thermal emission in a low metallicity environment by
choosing NGC 4214 of which gas metallicity (log O/H + 12) is 8.34. We found
that the SED is quite similar to those of IRAS bright galaxies sample (IBGS)
which are local bright star-forming galaxies with metallicity comparable to the
solar abundance. A dust temperature and an emissivity index for NGC 4214
obtained by a fitting to the single temperature greybody model are T_d = 35 \pm
0.8 K and beta = 1.4 \pm 0.1, respectively, which are typical values for IBGS.
Compiling the previous studies on similar nearby dwarf irregular galaxies, we
found that NGC 1569 shows similar results to those of NGC 4214, while NGC 4449
and IC 10 SE show different SEDs and low emissivity indices. There seems to be
a variety of SEDs among metal poor dwarf irregular galaxies. We examined
dependence on intensity of interstellar radiation field as well as
two-temperature model, but the origin of the difference is not clear. Some
mechanism(s) other than metallicity and interstellar radiation field must be
responsible for controlling dust emission property.

defines the phase volume of the trapping configurations of the random
potential, which are responsible for the low-$T$ tail. To see this, we perform
the averaging over the low-$T$ disorder configurations by first introducing a
finite lattice spacing $\sim a$, and then demonstrating that the prefactor in
the corresponding functional integral is exponentially small and depends on $a$
even as $a \to 0$. Moreover, we demonstrate that this restriction of the phase
volume leads to the dramatic change in the shape of the tail of ${\cal P}(\ln
T)$ from universal Gaussian in $\ln T $ to a simple exponential (in $\ln T $)
with exponent depending on $a$. Severity of the phase-volume restriction
affects the shape of the low-$T$ disorder configurations transforming them from
almost periodic (Bragg mirrors) to periodically-sign-alternating (loose

possible the detection of weak gravitational waves in the region of high

interferometers must permanently monitor, record and compensate much larger
external interventions that take place in the region of low frequencies of
geophysical interest, ~ 10^{-5} - 3 X 10^{-3} Hz. Such phenomena as tidal
perturbations of land and gravity, normal mode oscillations of Earth,
oscillations of the inner core of Earth, etc. will inevitably affect the
performance of the interferometers and, therefore, the information about them
will be stored in the data of control systems. We specifically identify the
low-frequency information contained in distances between the interferometer
mirrors (deformation of Earth) and angles between the mirrors' suspensions
(deviations of local gravity vectors and plumb lines). We show that the access
to the angular information may require some modest amendments to the optical
scheme of the interferometers, and we suggest the ways of doing that. The
detailed evaluation of environmental and instrumental noises indicates that
they will not prevent, even if only marginally, the detection of interesting
geophysical phenomena. Gravitational-wave instruments seem to be capable of
reaching, as a by-product of their continuous operation, very ambitious
geophysical goals, such as observation of the Earth's inner core oscillations.

combine into a single particle that bears the mass of each of them. Choosing
the initial density of particles so that, if their size is very small, a
typical one is liable to interact with a unit order of other particles in a

and very general theorem of Alon, Pach, Pinchasi, Radoicic, and Sharir. We
describe these results and discuss several related issues, including a
generalization to ``Erdos-Hajnal sets'' and an intriguing problem concerning
the decomposability of semi-algebraic sets: Do all semi-algebraic sets belong
to the set algebra generated by semigroups in $R^d$? Our main result is a
resolution of this question in dimensions 1 and 2.

knots. A Drinfeld associator is a series in two non-commuting variables,
satisfying highly complicated algebraic equations - hexagon and pentagon. The
logarithm of a Drinfeld associator lives in the Lie algbera L generated by the
symbols a,b,c modulo [a,b]=[b,c]=[c,a]. The main result is a description of
compressed associators that satisfy the compressed pentagon and hexagon in the
quotient L/[[L,L],[L,L]]. The key ingredient is an explicit form of
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula in the case when all commutators commute.

even-even C isotopes was done based on the method of antisymmetrized molecular
dynamics. The $E2$ transition strength was discussed in relation to the
deformation. We analyze the $B(E2;2^+_1\to 0^+_1)$ in $^{16}$C, which has been
recently measured to be abnormally small. The results suggest the difference of
the deformations between proton and neutron densities in the neutron-rich C
isotopes. It was found that stable proton structure in C isotopes plays an
important role in the enhancement the neutron skin structure as well as in the
systematics of $B(E2)$ in the neutron-rich C.

loss of atoms from the trap. We develop second-order perturbation theory for a
tensorial perturbation of a spherically symmetric system and the theory is then
applied to processes mediated by the spin-dipole interaction. Redistribution
and loss mechanisms are studied for the case of spin-polarized metastable
helium atoms and results obtained for the five lowest s states in the trap and
trapping frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 10 MHz.

  condensation mechanism","12 pages, 6 figures, RevTeX4",,,,"q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph",,"  Dynamics of the polymorphic A<->B transitions in DNA is compared for two
polypurine sequences, poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dG).poly(dC), long known to
exhibit contrasting properties in experiments. In free molecular dynamics
simulations reversible transitions are induced by changing the size of a water
drop around DNA neutralized by Na ions. In poly(dG).poly(dC) the B<->A
transitions are easy, smooth and perfectly reversible. In contrast, a B->A
transition in poly(dA).poly(dT) dodecamer fragment could not be obtained even
though its A-form is stable under low hydration. Normal B->A transitions are
observed, however, in long poly(dA).poly(dT) stretches flanked by GC pairs. An
intermediate range of hydration numbers is identified where opposite
transitions are observed in the two dodecamer fragments, namely, A->B in
poly(dA).poly(dT) and B->A in poly(dG).poly(dC). With hydration numbers close
to the stability limit of the B-form, the two sequences exhibit qualitatively
different counterion distributions, with a characteristic accumulation of Na
ions next to the opening of the minor groove in poly(dA).poly(dT). This
difference can explain an increased persistence of poly(dA).poly(dT) DNA
towards A-form in crystalline and amorphous fibers as compared to solution
conditions. The good overall agreement with experimental data corroborates the
general role of the electrostatic condensation mechanism in the A/B
polymorphism in DNA.
