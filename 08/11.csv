six days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within their
envelopes which are induced by their host stars. In the period range of 7-21
days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits.
These will be referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this
discrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young
stars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal
disturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can
excite eccentricity growth, and for a more slowly spinning star, at least
reduce the eccentricity damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the
envelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity
damping process. Based on these results, we suggest that short-period planets
around relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity
than those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of
angular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than
the tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very-short
(3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in
which the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and
synchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such
configurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with
orbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the
angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is
therefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such
stars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.

in microlensing light curves from which the size of the source can be
determined. Various emission processes, however, result in sources with a
fractal appearance, possessing structure on a range of scales. Here, the
gravitational microlensing of such fractal sources at the heart of quasars is
considered. It is shown that the resulting light curves reflect the fractal
nature of the sources, possessing pronounced structure at various scales,
markedly different to the case with the random distribution of emission clouds
that are typically considered. Hence, the determination of a characteristic
scale of variability in a microlensing light curve may not necessarily reveal
the size of the individual emission clouds, the key value that is required to
determine the physical state of the emission region, rather it may correspond
to a particular hierarchy in a fractal structure. Current X-ray satellites can
detect such fractal structure via the monitoring of gravitationally lensed
quasars during a microlensing event, providing a test of high energy emission
processes in quasars.

One obvious reason is HST's high spatial resolution, but equally important is
the wavelength range offered by the instruments on board HST, in particular the
blue and near-UV coverage which is essential for age-dating young clusters. HST
observations have helped establish the ubiquity of young massive clusters
(YMCs) in a wide variety of star-forming environments, from dwarf galaxies and
spiral disks to nuclear starbursts and mergers. These YMCs have masses and
sizes similar to those of old globular clusters (GCs), and the two may be
closely related. A large fraction of all stars seem to be born in clusters, but
most clusters disrupt rapidly and the stars disperse to become part of the
field population. In most cases studied to date the luminosity functions of
young cluster systems are well fit by power-laws dN(L)/dL ~ L^-2, and the
luminosity of the brightest cluster can (with few exceptions) be predicted from
simple sampling statistics. Mass functions have only been constrained in a few
cases, but appear to be well approximated by similar power-laws. The absence of
any characteristic mass scale for cluster formation suggests that star clusters
of all masses form by the same basic process, without any need to invoke
special mechanisms for the formation of YMCs. It is possible, however, that
special conditions can lead to the formation of a few YMCs in some dwarfs where
the mass function is discontinuous. Further studies of mass functions for star
clusters of different ages may help test the theoretical prediction that the
power-law mass distribution observed in young cluster systems can evolve
towards the approximately log-normal distribution seen in old GC systems.

main sequence lifetime? Is it possible that single massive star formation is
occurring far from the galactic plane? Are these objects something else
masquerading as main sequence B stars? This paper (the first of two) analyzes
the abundances of a sample of these stars and reveals several which are
chemically similar to nearby Population I B stars while others clearly have
abundance patterns more like those expected in BHB or PAGB stars. Several of
those with old evolved star abundances also have interesting features of note
in their spectra. We also consider why this sample does not have any classical
Be stars and identify at least two nearby solar metallicity BHB stars.

asymmetric double-well lower adiabatic potential with a variable shape. We show
that the doublet structure of levels (generic for double-well potentials) is
remained valid as long as the transition matrix element is smaller than
characteristic inter-level spacings (the latter ones in own turn decrease upon
increasing of a difference between the diabatic potential minima). In the
adiabatic limit the tunneling transitions do not depend on the upper potential.
In the over-barrier energy region there is an oscillating behavior due to the
resonances between the states in the lower and in the upper adiabatic
potentials. A new phenomenom emanated from this oscillating dependence namely,
multiple coherent - incoherent regime transitions for the upper adiabatic
potential state evolution, is our main concern in this paper. The problem is
not only of intellectual interest but also of relevance to various molecular
systems undergoing conversion of electronic states or isomerization reactions.
Our model exhausts all cases practically relevant for spectroscopy of non-rigid

find that the profiles of the zero modes, which are similar in all these
models, essentially control the underlying flavor structure. This implies that
our results are robust and model independent in this class of models. We
discuss in detail the origin of the signals in B-physics. We also briefly study
other NP signatures that arise in rare K decays ($K \to \pi \nu \nu$), in rare
top decays [$t \to c \gamma (Z, gluon)$] and the possibilty of CP asymmetries
in $D^0$ decays to CP eigenstates such as $K_S \pi^0$ and others. Finally we
demonstrate that with light KK masses, $\sim3$ TeV, the above class of models
with anarchic $5D$ Yukawas has a ``CP problem'' since contributions to the
neutron electric dipole moment are roughly 20 times larger than the current
experimental bound. Using AdS/CFT correspondence, these extra-dimensional

have many mysterious properties. Among other things, it is not clear what sets
their tension, what is their relation to the better understood BPS D-branes,
and why the open string tachyon on them is described by an effective Lagrangian
which suggests that the tachyon corresponds to an extra spatial dimension
transverse to the branes. We point out that the dynamics of D-branes in the
presence of Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes on a transverse R^3 times S^1 provides a
useful toy model for studying these issues. From the point of view of a 5+1
dimensional observer living on the fivebranes, BPS D-branes in ten dimensions
give rise to two kinds of D-branes, which are BPS or non-BPS depending on
whether they do or do not wrap the S^1. Their tensions are related, since from
a higher dimensional perspective, they are the same objects. D-branes localized
on the S^1 have a tachyon corresponding to their position on the circle. This
field is described by the same Lagrangian as that of a tachyon on a non-BPS
D-brane in ten dimensions. Its geometrical interpretation is useful for
clarifying the properties of non-BPS branes in six dimensions. If the lessons
from the six dimensional system can be applied in ten dimensions, the existence
of non-BPS D-branes seems to suggest the presence of at least one extra
dimension in critical type II string theory.

Veneziano-Yankielowicz (VY) type for two non-supersymmetric theories containing
one Dirac fermion in the two-index antisymmetric or symmetric representation of
the gauge group (orientifold theories). Since these theories are planar
equivalent, at N\to\infty to super Yang-Mill their effective Lagrangians
coincides with the bosonic part of the VY Lagrangian. We depart from the
supersymmetric limit in two ways. First, we consider finite but still large
values of N. Then 1/N effects break supersymmetry. We suggest a minimal
modification of the VY Lagrangian which incorporates these 1/N effects, leading
to a non-vanishing vacuum energy density. We then analyze the spectrum at
finite N. For N=3 the two-index antisymmetric representation (one flavor) is
equivalent to one-flavor QCD. We show that in this case the scalar
quark-antiquark state is heavier than the corresponding pseudoscalar state,
``eta^prime''. Second, we add a small fermion mass term. The fermion mass term
breaks supersymmetry explicitly. The vacuum degeneracy is lifted. The parity
doublets split. We evaluate the splitting. Finally, we include the \theta-angle

corresponds to the collision of two empty orbifold planes approaching each
other at a constant non-relativistic speed in a locally flat background

show that $p$-brane states which wind around the extra dimension propagate
smoothly and unambiguously across the orbifold plane collision. In particular
we calculate the quantum mechanical production of winding M2-branes extending
from one orbifold to the other. We find that the resulting density is finite
and that the resulting gravitational back-reaction is small. These winding
states, which include the string theory graviton, can be propagated smoothly
across the transition using a perturbative expansion in the membrane tension,
an expansion which from the point of view of string theory is an expansion in
{\it inverse} powers of $\alpha'$. We argue that interactions should be
well-behaved because the string coupling tends to zero at the crunch. The
production of massive Kaluza-Klein states should also be exponentially
suppressed for small collision speeds. We contrast this good behavior with that
found in previous studies of strings in Lorentzian orbifolds.

corrected trajectory, the branes rapidly coincide and remain trapped in a
configuration with enhanced symmetry. This is a purely stringy effect which
makes relativistic brane collisions exceptionally inelastic. We trace this
effect to velocity-dependent corrections to the open-string mass, which render
open strings between relativistic D-branes surprisingly light. We observe that
pair-creation of open strings could play an important role in cosmological
scenarios in which branes approach each other at very high speeds.

theory of Gromov-Witten invariants for a singular scheme of the gluing form
$Y_1\cup_D Y_2$ that arises from a degeneration $W/{\Bbb A}^1$ and a theory of
relative Gromov-Witten invariants for a codimension-1 relative pair $(Y,D)$. As
a summit, he derived a degeneration formula that relates a finite summation of
the usual Gromov-Witten invariants of a general smooth fiber $W_t$ of $W/{\Bbb
A}^1$ to the Gromov-Witten invariants of the singular fiber $W_0=Y_1\cup_D Y_2$
via gluing the relative pairs $(Y_1,D)$ and $(Y_2,D)$. The finite sum mentioned
above depends on a relative ample line bundle $H$ on $W/{\Bbb A}^1$. His theory
has already applications to string theory and mathematics alike. For other new
applications of Jun Li's theory, one needs a refined degeneration formula that
depends on a curve class $\beta$ in $A_{\ast}(W_t)$ or $H_2(W_t;{\Bbb Z})$,
rather than on the line bundle $H$. Some monodromy effect has to be taken care
of to deal with this. For the simple but useful case of a degeneration $W/{\Bbb

explain how the details of Jun Li's work can be employed to reach such a
desired degeneration formula. The related set $\Omega_{(g,k;\beta)}$ of
admissible triples adapted to $(g,k;\beta)$ that appears in the formula can be
obtained via an analysis on the intersection numbers of relevant cycles and a
study of Mori cones that appear in the problem. This set is intrinsically
determined by $(g,k;\beta)$ and the normal bundle ${\cal N}_{Z/X}$ of the

equation (SPE). We show that both equations can be derived from Maxwell's

rotation of a body makes it possible to obtain a number of bounds on the
rotational characteristics within individual rotational bands of nonspherical
nuclei. As a result, the bounds between which the possible values of the
critical spin $J_c$ lie can be expressed exclusively in terms of a restricted
number of the experimentally most accessible data on the lower phase $J<J_c$
for a given nuclide. The bounds are tested on the ground-state rotational bands
(yrast lines) of even-even nuclei, in which the corresponding phase transition
(backbending) has already been observed experimentally. For nuclei with
pronounced non-sphericity, all the bounds are invariably confirmed. For the
ground-state rotational bands for which the phase transition point $J =J_c$ has
not yet been reached, predictions are made for the corresponding values of
$J_c^{min}$ and, especially, $J_c^{max}$. The specific features of excited
rotational bands, and also the bands of odd nuclei are discussed.

Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation Theory (RMBPT), how even for relatively

of different total angular momentum but identical orbital angular momentum to
have different energies. We show that only large scale calculations that
include all single excitations, even those obeying the Brillouin's theorem have
the correct limit. We reproduce very accurately recent high-precision
measurements in F-like Ar, and turn then into precise test of QED. We obtain
the correct non-relativistic limit not only for fine structure but also for
level energies and show that RMBPT calculations are not immune to this problem.

show that this can be explained in terms of the QED Lamb shift. We quantify the
performance of the proposed quantum logic gates in the presence of dissipative
mechanisms. The unitary transformations required for performing one- and
