  Symposium 225, ed. Mellier & Meylan",,"10.1017/S1743921305002073",,"astro-ph",,"  The gravitational lensing constraints on the small mass end of the LCDM mass
function are discussed. Here a conservative approach is taken where only the
most difficult to explain image flux anomalies in strong QSO lenses are
emphasized. Numerical simulations are performed to compare predictions for the
LCDM small scale mass function with the observed flux ratios. It is found that
the cusp caustic lens anomalies and the disagreements between monochromatic
flux ratios and simple lens models can be explained without any substructure in
the primary lenses' dark matter halos. Extragalactic LCDM halos of mass < 10^9
Msun are enough to naturally explain these anomalies. This does not mean that
substructure within the host lens is not contributing. In fact, it could
dominate the lensing depending on how much of substructure survives in the
centers of galactic halos.
  Spectroscopic gravitational lensing provides more information on the nature
of these substructures. Thus far, the one relevant case in which this technique
has been used, observations of Q2237+0305, shows evidence of more small mass
halos (~ 10^6 Msun$) than is expected in the LCDM model.

intergalactic medium (IGM) during the reionization of the universe often found
their paths blocked by cosmological minihaloes. When this happened, the neutral
gas which filled each minihalo was photoevaporated; as the I-front burned its
way through the halo, decelerating from R-type to D-type, all the gas was blown
back into the IGM as an ionized, supersonic wind. In a previous paper (Shapiro,
Iliev and Raga 2004), we described this process and presented our results of
the first simulations of it by numerical gas dynamics with radiation transport
in detail. For illustration we focused on the particular case of a 10^7 solar
masses minihalo overrun at z=9 by an intergalactic I-front caused by a distant
source of ionizing radiation, for different source spectra (either stellar from
massive Pop. II or III stars, or QSO-like) and a flux level typical of that
expected during reionization. In a LambdaCDM universe, minihaloes formed in
abundance before and during reionization and, thus, their photoevaporation is
an important, possibly dominant, feature of reionization, which slowed it down
and wasted ionizing photons. We have now performed a larger set of
high-resolution simulations to determine and quantify the dependence of
minihalo photoevaporation times and photon consumption rates on halo mass,
redshift, ionizing flux level and spectrum. We find that the average number of
ionizing photons each minihalo atom absorbs during its photoevaporation is
typically in the range 2-10. For the collapsed fraction in minihaloes expected
during reionization, this can add about 1 photon per total atom to the
requirements for completing reionization, potentially doubling the minimum
number of photons required to reionize the universe.

that multiple SN explosions produce kpc--size expanding hot bubbles, which
drive cool, dense shells by strong shock. The colliding high--density cooling

$\sim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable to the observed level in LABs. Also,
recently discovered bubbly features in some LABs are quite similar to the

demonstrates that LABs are representative of evolving primordial galaxies; they
could hold direct information on the early chemical enrichment of galaxies,
contrary to present--day galaxies which have undergone intense recycling of
interstellar matter, thus erasing most of the early chemical history. It turns
out that the metal mixing proceeds in a very inhomogeneous fashion, so that
there appears a large spread of metallicity, that is,$[{\rm Fe/H}] \approx 0

to probe out to high redshifts, to the epoch of deceleration. However, the
prompt energy release in GRBs, even when corrected for jetting geometry, is far
from being a standard candle. We explore the cosmographic potential of a GRB
standard candle based on the newly-discovered relation by Ghirlanda et al.
between the apparent geometry-corrected energies (E_gamma) and the peak of the
prompt burst spectrum (E_p). We present an explicit, self-consistent formalism
for correcting GRB energies with a thorough accounting for observational
uncertainties. In contrast to other work, we demonstrate that the current
sample of 19 GRBs is not yet cosmographically competitive with results from
other studies (e.g., SNe Ia). Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a
significant correlation across a range of cosmologies, the goodness of fit of
the data to a power law, depends strongly on input assumptions -- especially
the unknown density of the circumburst medium. Independent of assumptions, with
very few low-z bursts, the current sample is most sensitive to Omega_M but
essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda. The proper use of the relation clearly
brings GRBs an impressive step closer toward a standardizable candle, but until
the physical origin of the E_p-E_gamma relation is understood, calibrated with
a training set of low redshift bursts, and the major potential systematic
uncertainties and selection effects are addressed, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography (abridged).

trigger, for the Swift XRT, Chandra ACIS and XMM Epic detectors. For bursts
with standard luminosities, decay rates and equivalent widths of 1 keV assumed
constant starting at early source-frame epochs, Swift may be able to detect
lines up to z~1.5 with a significance of better than 3 sigma for times up to
10^4 s. The same lines would be detectable with better than 4 sigma
significance at z up to 6 by Chandra, and up to 8 by XMM, for times of up to
10^5 s. For similar bursts with a variable equivalent width peaking at 1 keV
between 0.5 and 1 days in the source frame, Swift achieves the same
significance level for z~1 at t~1 day, while Chandra reaches the previous
detection significances around t~ 1-2 days for z~ 2-4, i.e. the line is
detectable near the peak equivalent width times, and undetectable at earlier or
later times. For afterglows in the upper range of initial X-ray luminosites
afterglows, which may also be typical of pop. III bursts, similar significance
levels are obtained out to substantially higher redshifts. A distinction
between broad and narrow lines to better than 3 sigma is possible with Chandra
and XMM out to z~2 and ~6.5, respectively, while Swift can do so up to z~1, for
standard burst parameters. A distinction between different energy centroid
lines of 6.4 keV vs. 6.7 KeV (or 6.7 keV vs. Cobalt 7.2 keV) is possible up to

magnitude in initial chameleon energy density, the attractor is reached before
nucleosynthesis. Surprisingly, the range of allowed initial conditions leading
to a successful cosmology is wider than in normal quintessence. We discuss
applications to the cyclic model of the universe and show how the chameleon

compared with 32 Seyfert 2s in the same samples that we have previously
observed. We find that there is no significant difference in nuclear starburst
to AGN luminosity ratios between Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, and that nuclear
starburst luminosity positively correlates with AGN power in both types of
Seyferts. Our results favor a slightly-modified AGN unification model, which
predicts that nuclear starbursts occurring in the dusty tori of Seyferts are
physically connected to the central AGNs, rather than the classical unification
paradigm, in which the dusty tori simply hide the central AGNs of Seyfert 2s
and reprocess AGN radiation as infrared dust emission in Seyferts. No
significant differences in nuclear star formation properties are recognizable
between Seyfert 1s in the CfA and 12 micron samples.

10 isolated galaxies with the Anglo-Australian Telescope confirms their

galaxy groups as a control sample. The isolated galaxies are shown to be more
gravitationally isolated than the group galaxies. We find that the isolated
early-type galaxies have a mean effective colour of (B-R)_e = 1.54 +/- 0.14,
similar to their high-density counterparts. They reveal a similar
colour-magnitude relation slope and small intrinsic scatter to cluster
ellipticals. They also follow the Kormendy relation of surface brightness
versus size for luminous cluster galaxies. Such properties suggest that the
isolated galaxies formed at a similar epoch to cluster galaxies, such that the
bulk of their stars are very old. However, our galaxy modelling reveals
evidence for dust lanes, plumes, shells, boxy and disk isophotes in four out of
nine galaxies. Thus at least some isolated galaxies have experienced a recent
merger/accretion event which may have induced a small burst of star formation.
We derive luminosity functions for the isolated galaxies and find a faint slope
of -1.2, which is similar to the `universal' slope found in a wide variety of
environments. We examine the number density distribution of galaxies in the
field of the isolated galaxies.

have settled towards the midplane, so charges are carried by electrons and ions
only. Solutions are obtained at representative radial locations from the
central protostar for different choices of the initial magnetic field strength,
sources of ionisation, and disc surface density.
  The MRI is active over a wide range of magnetic field strengths and fluid
conditions in low conductivity discs. For the minimum-mass solar nebula model,
incorporating cosmic ray ionisation, perturbations grow at 1 AU for B < 8 G.
For a significant subset of these strengths (0.2 - 5 G), the growth rate is of
order the ideal MHD rate (0.75 Omega). Similarly, when cosmic rays are assumed
to be excluded from the disc by the winds emitted by the magnetically active
protostar, unstable modes grow at this radius for B less than about 2 G.
  This study shows that, despite the low magnetic coupling, the magnetic field
is dynamically important for a large range of fluid conditions and field
strengths in protostellar discs. Hall diffusion largely determines the
structure and growth rate of these perturbations for all studied radii. At
radii of order 1 AU, in particular, it is crucial to incorporate the full
conductivity tensor in studies of the dynamics of astrophysical discs.

transverse motions of haloes in the multi-stream region lead to a thinner
pancake. In turn, collapse of the plane wave leads to formation of more massive
collapsed haloes as compared to the collapse of substructure in absence of the

into account. We consider two different models of the Milky Way potential: a
singular isothermal sphere and a three-component model. The progenitor dwarf is
expressed as an N-body system, which orbits in the fixed Galactic potential.
The dwarf lost more than 90 per cent of its mass during the first few
pericenter passages. Thereafter, the mass remains practically constant. The
final surface-density profile is in good agreement with the observational data
on omega Centauri, if the pericenter distance of the orbit of the progenitor
dwarf is around 500 pc. This value is within the error bar of the current
proper motion data on omega Centauri and Galactic parameters. Although our
simulation is limited to a King-like progenitor dwarf without a dark matter

Centauri can plausibly be identified with a stripped dwarf elliptical.

follows: The brightness of V1647 Ori stayed more than 4 mag above the
pre-outburst level until 2005 October when it started a rapid fading. In the
high state we found a periodic component in the optical light curves with a
period of 56 days. The delay between variations of the star and variations in
the brightness of clump of nearby nebulosity corresponds to an angle of 61+/-14
degrees between the axis of the nebula and the line of sight. A steady decrease
of HI emission line fluxes could be observed. In 2006 May, in the quiescent
phase, the HeI 1.083 line was observed in emission, contrary to its deep
blueshifted absorption observed during the outburst. The J-H and H-K_s color
maps of the infrared nebula reveal an envelope around the star. The color
distribution of the infrared nebula suggests reddening of the scattered light
inside a thick circumstellar disk. We show that the observed properties of
V1647 Ori could be interpreted in the framework of the thermal instability
models of Bell et al. (1995). V1647 Ori might belong to a new class of young
eruptive stars, defined by relatively short timescales, recurrent outbursts,
modest increase in bolometric luminosity and accretion rate, and an
evolutionary state earlier than that of typical EXors.

from dwarf disk galaxies, using a methodology previously employed to study the
self-enrichment efficiency of dwarf spheroidal systems. Unlike previous studies
that focused on highly concentrated starbursts, in the current work we consider
discrete supernova events spread throughout various fractions of the disk. We
model disk systems having gas masses of 10^8 and 10^9 solar masses with
supernova rates of 30, 300, and 3000 per Myr. The supernova events are confined
to the midplane of the disk, but distributed over radii of 0, 30, and 80% of
the disk radius, consistent with expectations for Type II supernovae. In
agreement with earlier studies, we find that the enriched material from
supernovae is largely lost when the supernovae are concentrated near the
nucleus, as expected for a starburst event. In contrast, however, we find the
loss of enriched material to be much less efficient when the supernovae occur
over even a relatively small fraction of the disk. The difference is due to the
ability of the system to relax following supernova events that occur over more
extended regions. Larger physical separations also reduce the likelihood of
supernovae going off within low-density ""chimneys"" swept out by previous
supernovae. We also find that, for the most distributed systems, significant
metal loss is more likely to be accompanied by significant mass loss. A
comparison with theoretical predications indicates that, when undergoing
self-regulated star formation, galaxies in the mass range considered shall
efficiently retain the products of Type II supernovae.

explanation for aspherical mass ejection and for pulsar recoil velocities even
in excess of 1000 km/s. We propose that the bimodality of the pulsar velocity
distribution might be a consequence of a dominant l=1 mode in case of the fast
component, while higher-mode anisotropy characterizes the postshock flow and SN
ejecta during the birth of the slow neutron stars. We argue that the observed
large asymmetries of supernovae and the measured high velocities of young
pulsars therefore do not imply rapid rotation of the iron core of the
progenitor star, nor do they require strong magnetic fields to play a crucial
role in the explosion. Anisotropic neutrino emission from accretion contributes
to the neutron star acceleration on a minor level, and pulsar kicks do not make
a good case for non-standard neutrino physics in the nascent neutron star.

algorithms as it has theoretical properties which help in theoretical analysis.
However, Boltzmann selection is not used in practice because a good annealing
schedule for the `inverse temperature' parameter is lacking. In this paper we
propose a Cauchy annealing schedule for Boltzmann selection scheme based on a
hypothesis that selection-strength should increase as evolutionary process goes
on and distance between two selection strengths should decrease for the process
to converge. To formalize these aspects, we develop formalism for selection
mechanisms using fitness distributions and give an appropriate measure for
selection-strength. In this paper, we prove an important result, by which we
derive an annealing schedule called Cauchy annealing schedule. We demonstrate
the novelty of proposed annealing schedule using simulations in the framework
of genetic algorithms.

start constraint propagation even when domains are not fully known, performing
acquisition of domain elements only when necessary, and without the need for
restarting the propagation after every acquisition.

2.2, 2.3, 2.4. Gribov-copy effects have been analyzed using the so-called
smeared gauge fixing. We also consider two different sets of momenta (orbits)
in order to check for possible effects due to the breaking of rotational
symmetry. The vertex has been evaluated at the asymmetric point (0;p,-p) in
momentum-subtraction scheme. We find that \widetilde{Z}_1(p^2) is approximately
constant and equal to 1, at least for momenta p > ~ 1 GeV. This constitutes a
nonperturbative verification of the so-called nonrenormalization of the Landau
ghost-gluon vertex. Finally, we use our data to evaluate the running coupling
constant \alpha_s(p^2).

colliders and in cosmic rays within the split supersymmetry scenario. Unlike in
the MSSM, the gluinos in this model are relatively long-lived due to the large
value of the squark masses which mediate their decay. Searches at colliders are
found to be sensitive to the nature of gluino fragmentation as well as the
gluino-hadron interactions with nuclei and energy deposition as it traverses
the detector. We find that the worst-case scenario, where a neutral
gluino-hadron passes through the detector with little energy deposition, is
well described by a monojet signature. For this case, using Run I data we
obtain a bound of $m_{\tilde g} > 170$ GeV; this will increase to 210(1100) GeV
at Run II(LHC) if no excess events are observed. In the opposite case, where a
charged gluino-hadron travels through the detector, a significantly greater
reach is obtained via stable charged particle search techniques. We also
examine the production of gluino pairs in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and
show they are potentially observable at IceCube; this would provide a
cross-check for observations at hadron colliders.

three different models. When all the power contributions, which include higher

considered here, not the specific properties of annihilation or creation

and, for other fields, Weyl-like noncovariant wave equations that are allowed
here because no assumptions are made to exclude them. The hypothesis produces
wave equations for translation-matrix-invariant fields while
translation-matrix-dependent coefficient functions have currents that are the
vector potentials of the coefficient functions of those
translation-matrix-invariant fields. The statement is proven by showing that
Maxwell equations are satisfied, though in keeping with the hypothesis they are
not assumed to hold. The underlying mechanism is the same for the massless
class here as it is for the massive class in a previous paper, suggesting that

possible modification of the nucleon form factors inside the nuclear medium.
Recent theoretical work predict changes in the form factors within the
experimental limits. Importantly, the longitudinal to sideways transferred
polarization ratio has been identified as being ideally suited for such
studies, as these polarization observables are believed to be the least
sensitive to most standard nuclear structure uncertainties while their ratio
shows a high sensitivity to the ratio of the electric to magnetic form factors.
The kinematic regime where the measurements have been undertaken is at
relatively high energy and it is clear that relativistic effects in wave
functions and operators are essential. In this work we focus on the analysis of
polarized $^{16}O(\vec{e},e'\vec{p})^{15}N$ observables. Our aim is to explore
a selected set of model dependences that could contaminate any attempt to infer
medium modifications, mainly related to the description of FSI and to the role
played by relativity.

By means of flow diagrams in the phase space of enatiometric concentrations,
chiral symmetry breaking is studied.
  Without any destruction processes, the quadratic autocatalysis leads to the
amplification of ee, but the flow is attracted to a fixed line, which is only
marginally stable. The destruction processes alter the attractor structure
completely. With a cross inhibition the linear autocatalysis is sufficient for
the chiral symmetry breaking with a complete homochirality. With a back
reaction, the quadratic autocatalysis is necessary to bring about the chiral
symmetry breaking. The final ee is not complete if there is a racemization
process.

computers, understanding loss of information through decoherence becomes
increasingly important. The information about a system that can be obtained
from its environment can facilitate quantum control and error correction.
Moreover, observers gain most of their information indirectly, by monitoring
(primarily photon) environments of the ""objects of interest."" Exactly how this
information is inscribed in the environment is essential for the emergence of
""the classical"" from the quantum substrate. In this paper, we examine how
many-qubit (or many-spin) environments can store information about a single
system. The information lost to the environment can be stored redundantly, or
it can be encoded in entangled modes of the environment. We go on to show that
randomly chosen states of the environment almost always encode the information
so that an observer must capture a majority of the environment to deduce the
system's state. Conversely, in the states produced by a typical decoherence
process, information about a particular observable of the system is stored
redundantly. This selective proliferation of ""the fittest information"" (known
as Quantum Darwinism) plays a key role in choosing the preferred, effectively
classical observables of macroscopic systems. The developing appreciation that
the environment functions not just as a garbage dump, but as a communication
channel, is extending our understanding of the environment's role in the
quantum-classical transition beyond the traditional paradigm of decoherence.
