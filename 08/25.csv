present a new method to obtain the cluster mass distribution using strong
lensing data without using any prior information on the underlying mass. The
method relies on the decomposition of the lens plane into individual cells. We
show how the problem in this approximation can be expressed as a system of
linear equations for which a solution can be found. Moreover, we propose to
include information about the null space. That is, make use of the pixels where
we know there are no arcs above the sky noise. The only prior information is an
estimation of the physical size of the sources. No priors on the luminosity of
the cluster or shape of the halos are needed thus making the results very
robust. In order to test the accuracy and bias of the method we make use of
simulated strong lensing data. We find that the method reproduces accurately
both the lens mass and source positions and provide error estimates.

been suspected to be the main engine responsible for the beginning of dust
growth, its advantage being that it provides for rapid growth. Its real
importance in planetary formation is still debated, mainly because the
potential presence of turbulence can prevent the settling of particles into a
gravitationally unstable layer. However, several mechanisms could yield
strongly inhomogeneous distributions of solids in the disk: radial drift,
trapping in vortices, perturbations by other massive bodies, etc. In this paper
we present a numerical study of a gravitationally unstable layer. This allows
us to go beyond the classical analytical study of linear perturbations,
exploring a highly non-linear regime. A hierarchical growth of structure in the
presence of dissipation (gas drag) can yield large, virialized clusters of
planetesimals, the first time such clusters have been observed in the context
of planetesimal disks.

formation without the systematic uncertainties of using different calibrators

CIRPASS has been successfully demonstrated in multi-object mode on the AAT and

appear between the OH sky lines, we can detect star formation rates of $5

polarization is found in more than half of the observed objects, and circular
polarization is tentatively detected in two sources. Class I and Class II
CH_3OH masers show similar polarization properties.The largest linear
polarization is found in the 133 GHz Class I maser towards L379 (39.5 %), and
in the 157 GHz Class II maser towards G9.62+0.19 (36.7 %). The spectral
profiles of the polarization angle of Class I masers are mostly flat, except
for two sources showing a linear slope. Since the mm-line methanol masers are
expected to be weakly (or not) saturated, we suggest that the stronger
fractional polarizations found by us are enhanced by anisotropic pumping and
radiative losses. In NGC 7538, we find, for both maser classes, a good
agreement between our polarization angles, and those measured for the
submillimeter dust continuum. This can be taken as evidence for magnetic
alignment of dust grains. It is also possible that an unsaturated maser with
equally populated magnetic substates simply amplifies polarized continuum seed
radiation. For Class II masers, the polarization properties of the various
velocity components towards a given source with detectable polarization are
quite homogeneous. A possible explanation is discussed. Since methanol is
non-paramagnetic, the circular polarization of the unsaturated maser emission
can only be due to variations of the angle between the magnetic field and the
line of sight along the maser propagation path.

presented and discarded within the past decade. The present paper gives an
overview of the problems related to the hitherto proposed feature
identifications, including the recently suggested candidate carrier silicon
carbide. We also discuss the case for spectroscopically promising oxides.
  SiC is shown to produce a strong resonance band at 20-21 micron if coated by
a layer of silicon dioxide. At low temperatures, core-mantle particles composed
of SiC and amorphous SiO$_2$ indeed have their strongest spectral signature at
a position of 20.1 micron, which coincides with the position of the ""21 micron""
emission band.
  The optical constants of another candidate carrier that has been relatively
neglected so far -- iron monoxide -- are proven to permit a fairly accurate
reproduction of the ""21 micron"" feature profile as well, especially when
low-temperature measurements of the infrared properties of FeO are taken into
account. As candidate carrier of the ""21 micron"" emission band, FeO has the
advantage of being stable against further oxidation and reduction only in a
narrow range of chemical and physical conditions, coinciding with the fact that
the feature, too, is detected in a small group of objects only. However, it is
unclear how FeO should form or survive particularly in carbon-rich PPNe.

introducing analytical expressions for the scale factor or the Hubble parameter

also seen that, whichever the fate of the tachyonic accelerating universe, it
will be stable to any fluctuations of the scalar field, and that since the
considered models have all an imaginary sound speed, any overdense regions will
undergo an accelerate collapse leading rapidly to formation of giant black
holes. Finally the conjecture is advanced that these black holes may be the

momenta of PSR B1534+12 to be either 25+/-4 deg or 155+/-4 deg. This
misalignment was almost certainly caused by an asymmetry in the supernova
explosion that formed its companion neutron star. Here we combine the
misalignment measurement with measurements of the pulsar and companion masses,
the orbital elements, proper motion, and interstellar scintillation. We show
that the orbit of the binary in the Galaxy is inconsistent with a velocity kick
large enough to produce a nearly antialigned spin axis, so the true
misalignment must be ~25 deg. Similar arguments lead to bounds on the mass of
the companion star immediately before its supernova: 3+/-1 Msun. The result is
a coherent scenario for the formation of the observed binary. After the first
supernova explosion, the neutron star that would eventually become the observed
pulsar was in a Be/X-ray type binary system with a companion of at least 10--12
Msun. During hydrogen (or possibly helium) shell burning, mass transfer
occurred in a common envelope phase, leaving the neutron star in a roughly
half-day orbit with a helium star with mass above ~3.3 Msun. A second phase of
mass transfer was then initiated by Roche lobe overflow during shell helium
burning, further reducing both the helium star mass and orbital period before
the second supernova. Scenarios that avoid Roche lobe overflow by the helium
star require larger helium star masses and predict space velocities
inconsistent with our measurements. The companion neutron star experienced a
velocity kick of 230+/-60 km/s at birth, leading to a systemic kick to the
binary of 180+/-60 km/s.

guard against the influence of possible biases and selection effects, we have
carefully matched samples of Seyfert 1, Seyfert 2, LINER, starburst and normal
galaxies in their basic properties, taking particular care to ensure that each
was observed with a similar average scale (10-15 parsecs per pixel). Several
morphological differences among our five different spectroscopic
classifications emerge from the analysis. The HII/starburst galaxies show the
strongest deviations from smooth elliptical isophotes, while the normal
galaxies and LINERS have the least disturbed morphology. The Seyfert 2 galaxies
have significantly more twisted isophotes than any other category, and the
early-type Seyfert 2s are significantly more disturbed than the early-type

after the onset of a magnetic flare. The X-ray irradiation by a flare creates a
hot spot at the disk surface where the plasma both heats up and expands in the

that the magnetic loop causing the flare is anchored deeply within the disk
interior, we derive analytical estimates for the vertical dimension H_hot and
the optical depth tau_es of the heated atmosphere as a function of the position
within the spot. We perform computations for various values of the accretion
rate dm/dt, the fraction f_cor of radiation dissipated within the disk corona,
and the covering factor f_cover of the disk surface with flare-illuminated
patches. It turns out that generally we can distinguish three characteristic
radial zones within the disk showing a qualitatively different behavior of the
heated material. In the innermost regions of the disk (inner zone) the
expansion of the disk material is restricted by strong gravitational forces.
Further out, the flare source, initially above the disk, soon becomes embedded
by the expanding disk atmosphere. At these intermediate disk radii (middle
zone) the material is optically thick thus greatly modifying the observed
radiation by multiple Compton scattering. We show exemplary spectra models
obtained from Monte Carlo simulations illustrating the trends. In the outermost
regions of the disk (outer zone) the expanding material is optically thin and
its influence on the observed spectra is smaller but pressure gradients in
radial directions should cause the development of a fountain-like dynamical
structure around the flare source. We discuss the observational consequences of
our results.

halos, and we show that this is pivotal in modeling correctly the galaxy
luminosity function at the bright end and the bimodal nature of galaxy color
distribution. Mergers of galaxies based on subhalos also result in many more
bright red galaxies at high $z$. The semi-analytical model we adopt is similar

effect of a prolonged cooling in small halos and that we explicitly follow the

predictions can match the luminosity functions of galaxies in various wavebands

well reproduced if galaxy mergers are modeled with the merger trees of subhalos

low-mass halos is comparable to the age of the universe. The model with

emission, and may be driven by the accretion rate of matter onto the central
compact object. The variance in PC2 is essentially due to the anti-correlation
between p_0 and the detachment index DI. PC2 may be related to the orientation
of the BAL QSOs with respect to the line of sight. We also consider a
spectropolarimetric sample of 21 BAL QSOs for which we define four indices
describing the polarization properties of the absorption and emission lines. We
find a possible anti-correlation between the detachment index and a quantity SI
which measures the ratio of the depths of the civ absorption in the polarized
flux and in the total flux. This correlation indicates that in BAL QSOs with P
cygni profiles, the BAL troughs in the polarized flux are nearly as deep as in
the total flux while, in BAL QSOs with detached absorptions, the BAL troughs in
the polarized flux are much weaker than in the total flux. We show that our
main results may be explained in the framework of a 'two-component' wind model.
In this model, the broad absorption occurs in a dense equatorial wind emerging
from the accretion disk, while scattering and polarization mainly take place in
a polar region.

polarization pattern which is typical for a young stellar object surrounded by
a large circumstellar disk and an envelope, seen almost edge-on. The strong
linear polarization in the bipolar lobes is caused by single scattering at dust
grains and allowed to locate the illuminating source which coincides with the

also considerably smaller than the upper critical field when the magnetic field
is parallel to the ab-plane. We propose that the difference between the onset
of the ZBCP and the onset of superconductivity can be understood in terms of
the existence of the single-component state predicted by Sigrist and Monien.

associated with the charge order disappeared just at the structural phase
transition temperature, $T_{\rm d2}$. However, for $x=0.075$ and 0.09, the
superlattice peaks still existed as a short range correlation even above

temperature dependences of the superlattice peak intensity, correlation length,

quantitative comparison of the structure factor associated with the charge

to their trap center and examine two alternative types of initial conditions,
referring to (i) a close-to-equilibrium situation in which the two species are
at the same temperature (well below the Fermi temperature and well above the
Bose-Einstein condensation temperature); and (ii) a far-from-equilibrium case
in which the impurities are given a Boltzmann distribution of momenta while the
fermions are at very low temperatures. The dynamics of the gas is evaluated by
the numerical solution of the Vlasov-Landau equations for the one-body
distribution functions, supported by some analytical results on the collisional
properties of a fermion gas. We find that the trapped gaseous mixture is close
to the collisionless regime for values of the parameters corresponding to

without increasing the strength of the interactions, either by going over to
heavier impurity masses or by matching the width of the momentum distribution

of electroweak gauge currents of fermions. The parameters introduced by these
authors are defined by the properties of the correlation functions at zero
momentum, and differ from the quantities calculated by examining the on-shell
properties of the electroweak gauge bosons. In this letter we discuss the
relationship between the zero-momentum and on-shell parameters. In addition, we
present the results of a calculation of these zero-momentum parameters in an

which can be deconstructed to a linear chain of SU(2) groups adjacent to a
chain of U(1) groups. Our results demonstrate the importance of the universal
""non-oblique"" corrections which are present and elucidate the relationships
among various calculations of electroweak quantities in these models. Our
expressions for these zero-momentum parameters depend only on the spectrum of
heavy vector-boson masses; therefore, the minimum size of the deviations
present in these models is related to the upper bound on the heavy vector-boson
masses derived from unitarity. We find that these models are disfavored by
precision electroweak data, independent of any assumptions about the background
metric or the behavior of the bulk coupling.

neutrino of one flavor or another; second, a factorization assumption that
reduces the time evolution problem to the solution of coupled equations for the
expectations of various bilinear forms in the neutrino fields. We designate the

neutrinos are strongly anisotropic in space. In some cases we find an
instability that leads to rapid evolution of the flavor-angle distribution,
even when it is seeded by a very small initial flavor mixing (or alternatively
by a very small neutrino mass$^2$ term). Turning to the more complete case in
which we do not assume the classical factorization, but instead solve for the
evolution under the influence of the full ""forward"" Hamiltonian, we find the
possibility of rapid evolution, under our definition, even when there is no

Supersymmetric standard models can reproduce such amount of the branching ratio
by taking a specific parameter set. The Higgsstrahlung process $e^{+}e^{-} \to
Zh^{0}$ is preferable because of its simple kinematic structure, then, the
signal process is $e^{+} e^{-} \to Z h^{0} \to Z \tau^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$. The

that the homotopy category $Ho(dg-Cat)$ is cartesian closed (i.e. possesses
internal Hom's relative to the tensor product). We use these two results in
order to prove a derived version of Morita theory, describing the morphisms
between dg-categories of modules over two dg-categories $C$ and $D$ as the
dg-category of $(C,D)$-bi-modules. Finally, we give three applications of our
results. The first one expresses Hochschild cohomology as endomorphisms of the
identity functor, as well as higher homotopy groups of the \emph{classifying
space of dg-categories} (i.e. the nerve of the category of dg-categories and
quasi-equivalences between them). The second application is the existence of a
good theory of localization for dg-categories, defined in terms of a natural
universal property. Our last application states that the dg-category of
(continuous) morphisms between the dg-categories of quasi-coherent (resp.
perfect) complexes on two schemes (resp. smooth and proper schemes) is
quasi-equivalent to the dg-category of quasi-coherent complexes (resp. perfect)
on their product.

  by F. Bogomolov and Yu. Tschinkel",,,,"math.AG",,"  This semi-expository paper discusses the log minimal model program as applied
to the moduli space of curves, especially in the case of curves of genus two.
Log canonical models for these moduli spaces can often be constructed using the
techniques of Geometric Invariant Theory. In genus two, this boils down to the
invariant theory of binary sextics, which was developed systematically in the
19th century.

eternal at least in relation to the past? This fundamental question was a main
topic in ancient philosophy of nature and the Middle Ages. Philosophically it
was more or less banished then by Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. But
it used to have and still has its revival in modern physical cosmology both in
the controversy between the big bang and steady state models some decades ago
and in the contemporary attempts to explain the big bang within a quantum
cosmological framework. This paper has two main goals: First a conceptual
clarification and distinction of different notions of ""big bang"" and ""universe""
is suggested, as well as a multiverse taxonomy and a classification of initial
and eternal cosmologies. Second, and with the help of this analysis, it is
shown how a conceptual and perhaps physical solution of the temporal aspect of
Immanuel Kant's ""first antinomy of pure reason"" is possible, i.e. how our
universe in some respect could have both a beginning and an eternal existence.
Therefore, paradoxically, there might have been a time before time or a
beginning of time in time. - Keywords: cosmology, big bang, big crunch,

behaviors performed by colony of ants. First, task allocation phenomena are
treated from the viewpoint of proportion regulation of population between
different states. Using a dynamical model consisting of elements and external
``stock materials'', adaptability against various disturbances is numerically
studied. In addition, a dynamical model for a colony ants interacting via two
kind of pheromones is studied, in which simulated ants, as a mass, are shown to
make an efficient foraging flexibly varying the foraging tactics according to
feeding schedules. Finally, experiments are performed with robots moving in
virtual pheromone fields simulated by CG and CCD camera feedback system. Trail
formation processes are demonstrated by this multi-robot system.

within the frame of the theory of quantitative traits. Two components of
fitness are considered: a static one that describes adaptation to environmental
factors not related to the population itself, and a dynamic one that accounts
for interactions between organisms e.g. competition. We focus on the dynamics
of colonization of an empty niche. As competition is a function of the
population, selection pressure rapidly changes in time. The simulations show
that both in the case of flat and steep static fitness landscapes,
recombination provides a high velocity of movement in the phenotypic space thus
allowing recombinants to colonize the highest fitness regions earlier than non
recombinants that are often driven to extinction. The stabilizing effects of
competition and assortativity are also discussed. Finally, the analysis of
phase diagrams shows that competition is the key factor for the evolution of
recombination, while assortativity plays a significant role only in small
populations.

that the initial Gaussian wave packet in this system with optimal field

  file included","J. Phys. II France 4 (1994) 1955-74",,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a semiclassical perturbation method for the description of atomic
diffraction by a weakly modulated potential. It proceeds in a way similar to
the treatment of light diffraction by a thin phase grating, and consists in
calculating the atomic wavefunction by means of action integrals along the
classical trajectories of the atoms in the absence of the modulated part of the
potential. The capabilities and the validity condition of the method are
illustrated on the well-known case of atomic diffraction by a Gaussian standing
wave. We prove that in this situation the perturbation method is equivalent to
the Raman-Nath approximation, and we point out that the usually-considered
Raman-Nath validity condition can lead to inaccuracies in the evaluation of the
phases of the diffraction amplitudes. The method is also applied to the case of
an evanescent wave reflection grating, and an analytical expression for the
diffraction pattern at any incidence angle is obtained for the first time.
Finally, the application of the method to other situations is briefly
discussed.
