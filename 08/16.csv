interstellar matter (ISM) in galactic disks using observed line-of-sight
velocity fields. Although four components, consisting of two of position and
two of velocity, are necessary to determine two-dimensional orbits, the
velocity perpendicular to the line of sight can hardly be determined from
observations. We show that the ISM orbits can be approximately determined by
assuming that (1) the angular momentum is conserved along each orbit, (2) all
orbits are closed in a single rotating frame, and (3) the system is symmetric
through the origin. Since the angular momentum can be estimated on the major
axis of a disk, a velocity perpendicular to the line of sight can be determined
according to the conservation of angular momentum, and thus two components of
velocity are obtained. The ISM orbits can be calculated by solving differential
equations given by an obtained two-dimensional velocity field when a certain
pattern speed is given. The typical deviation from the correct orbit is less
than the observational resolution according to our test calculations for
modeled velocity fields. We applied this method to the observed data of NGC
4569 and obtained possible orbits for this galaxy. Furthermore, we calculated
the mass distribution using our result.

fragmentation of the disk. We find that slowly rotating cores (Omega t_ff =

Faster initial rotation rates (Omega t_ff = 0.2) result in the formation of a
ring which may fragment into two star-forming cores. The size of the rings
found in our simulated disks agree with the observations of similar systems.

features including nuclear spirals in the central parts. Some of the galaxies
show grand-design nuclear spirals. The morphology of grand-design spirals can
be further divided by the openness of the arms: tightly wound ones with winding
angle of around 3$\pi$ radian and open spirals with winding angle of around
$\pi$ radian. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we have investigated the
mechanism responsible for the openness of nuclear spirals. Since the gas flow
in the nuclear region is mainly governed by the central mass concentration near
the nuclei and the sound speed of the gas, we have examined various models with
different mass concentration represented by the mass of the central black hole
and different sound speeds. We found that the tightly wound spirals can be
formed when the mass of the black hole is large enough to remove the
inner-inner Lindblad resonances and sound speeds lie between 15 - 20 km/sec.
Thus, the presence of the tightly wound nuclear spiral could imply the presence
of relatively massive black hole in the center.

distributions on scales of milliarcseconds. In this study, we examine the
application of spectroastrometry to binary point sources which are spatially
unresolved due to the observational point spread function convolution. The
technique uses measurements with sub-pixel accuracy of the position centroid of
high signal-to-noise long-slit spectrum observations. With the objects in the
binary contributing fractionally more or less at different wavelengths
(particularly across spectral lines), the variation of the position centroid
with wavelength provides some information on the spatial distribution of the
flux. We examine the width of the flux distribution in the spatial direction,
and present its relation to the ratio of the fluxes of the two components of
the binary. Measurement of three observables (total flux, position centroid and
flux distribution width) at each wavelength allows a unique separation of the
total flux into its component parts even though the angular separation of the
binary is smaller than the observations' point-spread function. This is because
we have three relevant observables for three unknowns (the two fluxes, and the
angular separation of the binary), which therefore generates a closed problem.
This is a wholly different technique than conventional deconvolution methods,
which produce information on angular sizes of the sampling scale.
Spectroastrometry can produce information on smaller scales than conventional
deconvolution, and is successful in separating fluxes in a binary object with a
separation of less than one pixel. We present an analysis of the errors
involved in making binary object spectroastrometric measurements and the
separation method, and highlight necessary observing methodology.

single spike. Only in one case out of 309 was the structure clearly more
complex. The cumulative distribution is fit by a power law with index -1.40 +/-
0.01 with a low-energy but no high-energy cutoff. We estimate that giant pulses
occur frequently but are only rarely detected. When corrected for the
directivity factor, 25 giant pulses are estimated to be generated in one
neutron star revolution alone. The intensities of the giant pulses of the main
pulses and interpulses are not correlated with each other nor with the
intensities or energies of the main pulses and interpulses themselves. Their
radiation energy density can exceed 300 times the plasma energy density at the
surface of the neutron star and can even exceed the magnetic field energy
density at that surface. We therefore do not think that the generation of giant
pulses is linked to the plasma mechanisms in the magnetosphere. Instead we
suggest that it is directly related to discharges in the polar cap region of
the pulsar.

after its peripheral collision with a target nucleus is caused to rotate with a
high spin. The spinning fragment has a deformed shape and looks like an oblate
ellipsoid. Due to the virtual non-compressibility of nuclear matter, and the
polarization of the spin in the plane transverse to the input momentum of the
projectile nucleus such an ellipsoid has a reduced mean interaction
cross-section compared with a non-spinning fragment which has a spherical
shape. Purely geometrical arguments dictate that such an ellipsoidal nucleus
should have additional fluctuations of cross-section even at a fixed impact
parameter dependent on the orientation angle between the axis of the ellipsoid
and the vector connecting the centers of projectile and target nucleus. The
number of 'wounded nucleons' in the projectile nucleus participating in the
interaction correlates strongly with the interaction cross-section. All these
effects lead to a non-exponential attenuation of fragments and increased
probability for a fragment to penetrate down to a larger depth in the absorber,
than normal.
  If the sling effect appears in the interaction of a primary cosmic ray
nucleus with nuclei in the atmosphere the induced atmospheric cascade will have
a slower attenuation, and thereby can help to reduce some important
inconsistencies in the interpretation of the existing experimental data on
extensive air showers, observed in the lower half of the atmosphere. The paperr
gives numerical estimates of the sling effect.

was shown that in the Casimir limit, the film chemical potential oscillates

above 1 GeV in comparison with the expectations from conventional galactic
models. The excess is seen with the same spectrum in all sky directions, as
expected for Dark Matter (DM) annihilation. This hypothesis is investigated in
detail. The energy spectrum of the excess is used to limit the WIMP mass to the
50-100 GeV range, while the skymaps are used to determine the halo structure,
which is consistent with a triaxial isothermal halo with additional enhancement
of Dark Matter in the disc. The latter is strongly correlated with the ring of
stars around our galaxy at a distance of 14 kpc, thought to originate from the
tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy. It is shown that this ring of DM with a
mass of $\approx 2\cdot 10^{11} M_\odot$ causes the mysterious change of slope
in the rotation curve at $R=1.1R_0$ and the large local surface density of the
disc. The total mass of the halo is determined to be $3\cdot 10^{12} M_\odot$.
A cuspy profile is definitely excluded to describe the gamma ray data. These
signals of Dark Matter Annihilation are compatible with Supersymmetry for boost
factors of 20 upwards and have a statistical significance of more than
$10\sigma$ in comparison with the conventional galactic model. The latter
combined with all features mentioned above provides an intriguing hint that the
EGRET excess is indeed indirect evidence for Dark Matter Annihilation.

D_23 = 1/2 - sin^2(theta_23), is one of the key issues for understanding the
origin of the neutrino masses and mixing. In the three-neutrino context we
study the dependence of various observables in the atmospheric neutrinos on
D_23. We perform a global three-neutrino analysis of the atmospheric and
reactor neutrino data taking into account the effects of both the oscillations
driven by the ""solar"" parameters (Delta_m_21^2 and theta_12) and the 1-3
mixing. The departure from the one-dominant mass scale approximation results
into the shift of the 2-3 mixing from maximal by Delta_sin^2(theta_23) ~ 0.04,
so that D_23 ~ 0.04 +- 0.07 (1 sigma). Though value of the shift is not
statistically significant, the tendency is robust. The shift is induced by the
excess of the e-like events in the sub-GeV sample. We show that future large
scale water Cherenkov detectors can determine D_23 with accuracy of a few
percent, comparable with the sensitivity of future long baseline experiments.
Moreover, the atmospheric neutrinos will provide unique information on the sign
of the deviation (octant of theta_23).

First, a connection between fuzzy normed spaces defined by Felbin and certain

vector PN spaces are $F$-normable and paranormable, and also that locally
convex topological vector PN spaces are bornological. This last fact allows to
describe continuous linear operators between certain generalized \v{S}erstnev

usually thought of as locally compact quantum semi-group. When these notes were
written, in 1993, it was not at all clear what the extra assumptions on the
comultiplication should be for this pair to be a 'locally compact quantum
group'. This only became clear in 1999 thanks to the work of Kustermans and
Vaes. In the compact case however, rather natural conditions are formulated by
Woronowicz and a good notion of a compact quantum group was available in 1993.
  In these notes, we consider another class of locally compact quantum groups.
We assume the existence of a non-zero element $h$ in $A$ satisfying
$\Delta(a)(1\otimes h)=a \otimes h$ for all $a$ in $A$. We add some natural
conditions and we speak of a 'quasi-discrete locally compact quantum group'. We
also discuss the discrete case. We prove the existence of the Haar measure, the
regular representation, the fundamental unitary and we obtain the reduced dual.
  The quasi-discrete case is, in principle, more general than the discrete
case. Shortly after these notes were written, Kustermans showed that in fact,
the two classes coincided.
  For this reason, these notes have not been published. Nevertheless, some of
the results and techniques seem to be usful and in recent work, we came across
similar settings. Therefore, we have decided to make these notes available on
the net. We have added some comments at the end of the introduction and we have
updated the reference list. But apart from these minor changes, the notes are
still as they were written and distributed in 1993.

and a rate matrix that is particular to that edge. Thus, evolution follows
basically the same process for all characters, except that it occurs faster for
some characters than others. To allow estimation of tree topologies and edge
lengths for such models, it is commonly assumed that the scale factors are not
arbitrary unknown constants, but rather unobserved, independent, identically
distributed draws from a member of some parametric family of distributions. A
popular choice is the gamma family. We consider an example of a clock-like tree
with three taxa, one unknown edge length, and a parametric family of scale
factor distributions that contain the gamma family. This model has the property
that, for a generic choice of unknown edge length and scale factor
distribution, there is another edge length and scale factor distribution which
generates data with exactly the same distribution, so that even with infinitely
many data it will be typically impossible to make correct inferences about the
unknown edge length.
