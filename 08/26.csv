type 2 Seyferts. The star-formation history of these nuclei is reconstructed by
means of state-of-the art population synthesis modeling of their spectra in the
3500--5200 A interval. A QSO-like featureless continuum (FC) is added to the
models to account for possible scattered light from a hidden AGN.
  We find that: (1) The star-formation history of Seyfert 2 nuclei is
remarkably heterogeneous: young starbursts, intermediate age, and old stellar
populations all appear in significant and widely varying proportions. (2) A
significant fraction of the nuclei show a strong FC component, but this FC is
not always an indication of a hidden AGN: it can also betray the presence of a
young, dusty starburst. (3) We detect weak broad Hbeta emission in several
Seyfert 2s after cleaning the observed spectrum by subtracting the synthesis
model. These are most likely the weak scattered lines from the hidden Broad
Line Region envisaged in the unified model, given that in most of these cases
independent spectropolarimetry data finds a hidden Seyfert 1. (4) The FC
strengths obtained by the spectral decomposition are substantially larger for
the Seyfert 2s which present evidence of broad lines, implying that the
scattered non-stellar continuum is also detected. (5) There is no correlation
between the star-formation in the nucleus and either the central or overall

  meeting",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Galaxy cluster surveys are power tools for studying the dark energy. In
principle, the equation of state parameter w of the dark energy and its time
evolution can be extracted from large solid angle, high yield surveys that
deliver tens of thousands of clusters. Robust constraints require accurate
knowledge of the survey selection, and crude cluster redshift estimates must be
available. A simple survey observable like the cluster flux is connected to the
underlying cluster halo mass through a so--called mass--observable relation.
The calibration of this mass--observable relation and its redshift evolution is
a key challenge in extracting precise cosmological constraints. Cluster survey
self--calibration is a technique for meeting this challenge, and it can be
applied to large solid angle surveys. In essence, the cluster redshift
distribution, the cluster power spectrum, and a limited number of mass
measurements can be brought together to calibrate the survey and study the dark
energy simultaneously. Additional survey information like the shape of the mass
function and its evolution with redshift can then be used to test the
robustness of the dark energy constraints.

eight simulated clusters at z=0, we study velocity dispersion profiles of the

and gas sound speed as a function of radius and calculate the average Mach
number of galaxy motions. The simulations show that galaxies, on average, move
supersonically with the average Mach number of ~1.4, approximately independent
of the cluster-centric radius. The supersonic motions of galaxies may
potentially provide an important source of heating for the intracluster gas by
driving weak shocks and via dynamical friction, although these heating
processes appear to be inefficient in our simulations. We also find that
galaxies move faster than the dark matter particles in clusters. The magnitude
of the velocity bias, b_v~1.1, is, however, smaller than the bias estimated for
subhalos in dissipationless simulations. Interestingly, we find velocity bias
in the tangential component of the velocity dispersion, but not in the radial
component. Finally, we find significant random bulk motions of gas. The typical
gas velocities are of order ~20-30% of the gas sound speed. These random
motions provide about 10% of the total pressure support in our simulated
clusters. The non-thermal pressure support, if neglected, will bias
measurements of the total mass in the hydrostatic analyses of the X-ray cluster

signal-to-noise ratios than individual galaxy spectra, they are particularly
useful in quantifying general trends in star formation for galaxy populations
in distant clusters, z > 0.3. By measuring diagnostic features that represent
stellar populations of very different ages, a grand-composite spectrum can
reflect the fractions of those populations as accurately as if excellent
spectral measurements were available for each galaxy.
  Measuring the equivalent widths of spectral features in composite spectra is
especially well-suited for comparing cosmic variance of star formation in
clusters at a given redshift, or comparing clusters over a range of redshifts.
When we do this we find that [O II] emission and especially Balmer absorption
is strong in each of our intermediate-redshift clusters, and completely
separable from a sample of 12 present-epoch clusters, where these features are
weak. Specifically, we show by comparing to the H-delta strengths of

result is that thermal effects are at a negligible level even for fluctuations
correlated with the Sun illumination provided their frequency $f_{tf}$ is
larger than that of the Sun illumination ($f_{day}$) by a factor $f_{tf} /

the assumption that the gas and the dust temperature are equal. The gas
temperature, an essential ingredient in the equations of hydrostatic
equilibrium of the disk, is then determined from a continuum radiative transfer
calculation, in which the continuum opacity is provided by the dust. It has
been long debated whether this assumption still holds in the surface layers of
the disk, where the dust infrared emission features are produced. In this paper
we compute the temperature of the gas in the surface layers of the disk in a
self-consistent manner. The gas temperature is determined from a
heating-cooling balance equation in which processes such as photoelectric
heating, dissociative heating, dust-gas thermal heat exchange and line cooling
are included. The abundances of the dominant cooling species such as CO, C, C+
and O are determined from a chemical network based on the atomic species H, He,
C, O, S, Mg, Si, Fe (Kamp & Bertoldi 2000). The underlying disk models to our
calculations are the models of Dullemond, van Zadelhoff & Natta (2002). We find
that in general the dust and gas temperature are equal to withing 10% for A_V
>~ 0.1, which is above the location of the `super-heated surface layer' in
which the dust emission features are produced (e.g. Chiang & Goldreich 1997).
High above the disk surface the gas temperature exceeds the dust temperature
and can can become -- in the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- as
high as 600 K at a radius of 100 AU. This is a region where CO has fully
dissociated, but a significant fraction of hydrogen is still in molecular form.

photometric redshifts. Using the 3814 quasars of the SDSS Early Data Release
Quasar Catalog to generate a median color-redshift relation as a function of
redshift we find that, for this same sample, 83% of our predicted redshifts are
correct to within |Delta z|<0.3. The algorithm also determines the probability
that the redshift is correct, allowing for even more robust photometric
redshift determination for smaller, more restricted samples. We apply this
technique to a set of 8740 quasar candidates selected by the final version of
the SDSS quasar-selection algorithm. The photometric redshifts assigned to
non-quasars are restricted to a few well-defined values. In addition, 90% of
the objects with spectra that have photometric redshifts between 0.8 and 2.2
are quasars with accurate (|Delta z|<0.3) photometric redshifts. Many of these
quasars lie in a single region of color space; judicious application of
color-cuts can effectively select quasars with accurate photometric redshifts
from the SDSS database. When the SDSS is complete, this technique will allow
the determination of photometric redshifts for ~10^6 faint SDSS quasar
candidates, enabling advances in our knowledge of the quasar luminosity
function, gravitational lensing of quasars, and correlations among quasars and
between galaxies.

processability, low-cost fabrication and compatibility with arbitrary
substrates are some of the promising advantages of OFETs, among others. Of the
many organic materials available, pentacene, in particular, is one of the
leading candidates for use in current thin-film OFET architectures - this
because of its excellent electrical characteristics and its resistance to
atmospheric oxygen. In the recent literature, pentacene's transport properties,
as well as transistor performance, have already been analyzed from the point of
view of substrate treatments, pentacene evaporation rate and substrate
temperature, electrode chemical nature and channel geometry. The results show
that the morphology, crystal structure and molecular ordering of the first
organic monolayer(s) at the pentacene/dielectric interface are essential
determinants of carrier transport phenomena. To further investigate these
interface effects, we have built a model organic field-effect transistor which
consists essentially of a single layer of pentacene on an oxide substrate.
Four-probe and two-probe transport measurements as a function of temperature
and fields will be presented in relation with structural near-field
observations. The experimental results suggest a simple two-dimensional model
where the equilibrium between free and trapped carriers at the oxide interface

predicted to be an A-type antiferromagnetic structure, and the calculated

ordering, we find that even for a highly ionic compound such as KCuF3, the
orbital-order parameter is significantly reduced with respect to its nominal
value due to Cu(3d)--F(2p) hybridization. We also calculate the Cu K-edge
resonant x-ray scattering spectra for Bragg reflections associated with orbital
order. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the resonant signal is
dominated by the structural anisotropy in the distribution of the F neighbors
of the resonant Cu atom, and that the Cu-3d orbital ordering has only a minor
influence on the spectra. Our LDA+U results, however, also indicate that a
change in the magnetic structure has a small influence on the Jahn-Teller
distortion, and hence on the resonant spectrum, in the conventional
(room-temperature) crystallographic structure of KCuF3. This may indicate that
the large change observed experimentally in the resonant signal near the N\'eel

sets are studied that had been proposed by previous authors. The simulations

technique are employed and their performances are evaluated. The measured
observables include energy and dihedral probability densities (pds), integrated

unsuitable for these simulations. For all other sets, selected configurations

discuss the formation of bond order in the stripe phase. We suggest that the
spin Peierls order emerges in hole-rich domain walls (DWs) formed between
hole-poor regions in which long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations
exist. On the example of a single stripe we analyze the stability of such
structures. The motion of a hole inside the DW which takes the form of a bond
ordered ladder is in principle unrestricted. The hole hopping in domains is to
some extent obscured by the fact that a moving hole spoils AF correlations. The
propagation of a hole along the stripe which takes the form of the ladder-like
domain wall that separates antiphase AF domains is a combination of these two
types of motion occurring in two different environments. By analyzing the
energy dispersion of a quasiparticle propagating along the bond-centered,
bond-ordered stripe and of a quasiparticle propagating along the site-centered
stripe we deduce that bond ordered stripes are stable at the total doping level
1/8 and the linear stripe-filling level 1/2. This conclusion seems to be
relevant to the nature of the stripe phase in La_1.875 Ba_0.125 Cu O_4.

  Conversation, July 3-5, 2000, Bellagio, Italy",,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC",,"  In this paper we summarized a framework for designing grammar-based procedure
for the automatic extraction of the semantic content from spoken queries.
Starting with a case study and following an approach which combines the notions
of fuzziness and robustness in sentence parsing, we showed we built practical
domain-dependent rules which can be applied whenever it is possible to
superimpose a sentence-level semantic structure to a text without relying on a
previous deep syntactical analysis. This kind of procedure can be also
profitably used as a pre-processing tool in order to cut out part of the
sentence which have been recognized to have no relevance in the understanding
process. In the case of particular dialogue applications where there is no need
to build a complex semantic structure (e.g. word spotting or excerpting) the
presented methodology may represent an efficient alternative solution to a
sequential composition of deep linguistic analysis modules. Even if the query
generation problem may not seem a critical application it should be held in
mind that the sentence processing must be done on-line. Having this kind of
constraints we cannot design our system without caring for efficiency and thus
provide an immediate response. Another critical issue is related to whole
robustness of the system. In our case study we tried to make experiences on how
it is possible to deal with an unreliable and noisy input without asking the
user for any repetition or clarification. This may correspond to a similar
problem one may have when processing text coming from informal writing such as
e-mails, news and in many cases Web pages where it is often the case to have
irrelevant surrounding information.

show that their cosmogenic origin, in concert with the requirement that they

$(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})\oplus (\mathbf{3},\bar{\mathbf{2}})$ matter field
representation of $U_{EW}(2)$. Although the quarks carry unit intrinsic
electric charge in this construction, anomaly cancellation constrains the
Lagrangian in such a way that the quarks' associated currents couple to the
photon with the usual 2/3 and 1/3 fractional electric charge associated with
conventional quarks. The resulting model is identical to the Standard Model in
the $SU_C(3)$ sector: However, in the $U_{EW}(2)$ sector it is similar but not
necessarily equivalent. Off hand, the model appears to be phenomenologically
equivalent to the conventional quark model in the electroweak sector for
experimental conditions that preclude observation of individual constituent
currents. On the other hand, it is conceivable that detailed analyses for
electroweak reactions may reveal discrepancies with the Standard Model in high
energy and/or large momentum transfer reactions.
  The possibility of quarks with integer electric charge strongly suggests the
notion that leptons and quarks are merely different manifestations of the same
underlying field. A speculative model is proposed in which a phase transition
is assumed to occur between $SU_C(3)\otimes U_{EM}(1)$ and $U_{EM}(1)$ regimes.
This immediately; explains the equality of lepton/quark generations and
lepton/hadron electric charge, relates neutrino oscillations to quark flavor
mixing, reduces the free parameters of the Standard Model, and renders the
issue of quark confinement moot.

between families of the same symmetry type can be detected by calculating

lower-order terms of the 1-level density of some families of elliptic curves.
We show that there are essentially two different effects on the distribution of
low-lying zeros. First, low-lying zeros are more numerous in families of
elliptic curves E with relatively large numbers of points (mod p). Second, and
somewhat surprisingly, a family with a relatively large number of primes of bad
reduction has relatively fewer low-lying zeros.
  We also show that the lower order term can grow arbitrarily large by taking a
biased family with a relatively large number of points (mod p) for all small
primes p.

set-valued mappings, generalized and multivalued inverses, graphical
convergence of a net of functions in an extended multifunction space, and the

as distinct components of this unified mathematical structure that can be
viewed as an application of the theory of convergence in topological spaces to
increasingly nonlinear mappings, with the boundary between order and complexity
in the topology of graphical convergence being the region in Multi(X) that is
susceptible to chaos. The paper uses results from the discretized spectral
approximation in neutron transport theory and concludes that the numerically
exact results obtained by this approximation of the Case singular eigenfunction
solution is due to the graphical convergence of the Poisson and conjugate
Poisson kernels to the Dirac delta and the principal value multifunctions
respectively. In Multi(X), the continuous spectrum is shown to reduce to a
point spectrum, and we introduce a notion of latent chaotic states to interpret
superposition over generalized eigenfunctions. Along with these latent states,
spectral theory of nonlinear operators is used to conclude that nature supports
complexity to attain efficiently a multiplicity of states that otherwise would
remain unavailable to it.

structure when using a spectator-model current in point form. Then the
influences of different dynamics inherent in various kinds of constituent quark
models (Goldstone-boson-exchange, one-gluon-exchange, instanton-induced
interactions) are discussed. Finally the point-form results are compared to
analogous predictions calculated in instant form. Relativistic effects are
always of sizeable magnitude. A nonrelativistic approach is ruled out. The
instant-form results are afflicted with severe shortcomings. In the
spectator-model approximation for the current, only the point-form results
appear to be reasonable a-priori. In fact, the corresponding quark model
predictions provide a surprisingly good description of all elastic electroweak
observables in close agreement with existing experimental data, specifically
for the Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model.

$\alpha$ in the direction of anisotropy is determined in a self-consistent way
from data contained in the simulation itself. The dynamic model is initially
tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulent flows where $\alpha$ is
constant in space but it is allowed to vary in time. It is observed that by
using the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ procedure a more accurate simulation of the
isotropic homogeneous turbulence is achieved. The energy spectra and the total
kinetic energy decay are captured more accurately as compared with the
LANS-$\alpha$ simulations using a fixed $\alpha$. In order to evaluate the
applicability of the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model in anisotropic turbulence, a
priori test of a turbulent channel flow is performed. It is found that the
parameter $\alpha$ changes in the wall normal direction. Near a solid wall, the
length scale $\alpha$ is seen to depend on the distance from the wall with a
vanishing value at the wall. On the other hand, away from the wall, where the
turbulence is more isotropic, $\alpha$ approaches an almost constant value.
Furthermore, the behavior of the subgrid scale stresses in the near wall region
is captured accurately by the dynamic LANS-$\alpha$ model. The dynamic
LANS-$\alpha$ model has the potential to extend the applicability of the
LANS-$\alpha$ equations to more complicated anisotropic flows.

individuals interact in groups. The evolutionary stability of populations has
been analysed in the literature for the case where mutations in the population
may be considered as isolated events. For this case, and assuming simple
trigger strategies and many iterations per game, we analyse the rate of
convergence to the evolutionarily stable populations. We find that for some
values of the payoff parameters of the Prisoner's Dilemma this rate is so low
that the assumption, that mutations in the population are infrequent on that
timescale, is unreasonable. Furthermore, the problem is compounded as the group
size is increased. In order to address this issue, we derive a deterministic
approximation of the evolutionary dynamics with explicit, stochastic mutation
processes, valid when the population size is large. We then analyse how the
evolutionary dynamics depends on the following factors: mutation rate, group
size, the value of the payoff parameters, and the structure of the initial
population. In order to carry out the simulations for groups of more than just
a few individuals, we derive an efficient way of calculating the fitness
values. We find that when the mutation rate per individual and generation is
very low, the dynamics is characterised by populations which are evolutionarily
stable. As the mutation rate is increased, other fixed points with a higher
degree of cooperation become stable. For some values of the payoff parameters,
the system is characterised by (apparently) stable limit cycles dominated by
cooperative behaviour. The parameter regions corresponding to high degree of
cooperation grow in size with the mutation rate, and in number with the group
size.

single-mode Bose--Einstein condensates which are coupled via Josephson
tunneling. Using direct numerical diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian, we
compute the time evolution of the expectation value for the relative particle
number across a wide range of couplings. Our analysis shows that the system
exhibits rich and complex behaviours varying between harmonic and non-harmonic
oscillations, particularly around the threshold coupling between the
delocalised and self-trapping phases. We show that these behaviours are
dependent on both the initial state of the system as well as regime of the
coupling. In addition, a study of the dynamics for the variance of the relative
particle number expectation and the entanglement for different initial states
is presented in detail.

  Computation","15 pages, 14 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The information in quantum computers is often stored in identical two-level
systems (spins or pseudo-spins) that are separated by a distance shorter than
the characteristic wavelength of a reservoir which is responsible for
decoherence. In such a case, the collective spin-reservoir interaction, rather
than an individual spin-reservoir interaction, may determine the decoherence
characteristics. We use computational basis states, symmetrized spin states and
spin coherent states to study collective decoherence in the implementation of
various quantum algorithms. A simple method of implementing quantum algorithms
using stable subradiant states and avoiding unstable Dicke's superradiant
states and Schrodinger's cat states is proposed.

quantum mechanics is a statistical theory. It says us only about probability
distributions. The only possible criteria of quantum behaviour are statistical

statistics as quantum (""quantumlike""). A possible test is based on the
interference of probabilities. I was mainly interested in using such an
approach to ""quantumness"" to extend the domain of applications of quantum
mathematical formalism and especially to apply it to cognitive sciences. There
were done experiments on interference of probabilities for ensembles of
students and a nontrivial interference was really found. One could say that the
quantum statistical behaviour might be expected. But the problem was not so
trivial. Yes, we might expect nonclassical statistics, but there was no reason
to get the quantum one, i.e., cos-interference. But we got it!

influence of decoherence. We show that the lifetime of (distillable)
entanglement for GHZ-type superposition states decreases with the size of the
system, while for a class of other states -namely all graph states with
constant degree- the lifetime is independent of the system size. We show that
these results are largely independent of the specific decoherence model and are
in particular valid for all models which deal with individual couplings of
particles to independent environments, described by some quantum optical master
equation of Lindblad form. For GHZ states, we derive analytic expressions for
the lifetime of distillable entanglement and determine when the state becomes
fully separable. For all graph states, we derive lower and upper bounds on the
lifetime of entanglement. To this aim, we establish a method to calculate the
spectrum of the partial transposition for all mixed states which are diagonal
in a graph state basis. We also consider entanglement between different groups
of particles and determine the corresponding lifetimes as well as the change of
the kind of entanglement with time. This enables us to investigate the behavior
of entanglement under re-scaling and in the limit of large (infinite) number of
particles. Finally we investigate the lifetime of encoded quantum superposition
states and show that one can define an effective time in the encoded system
which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the physical time. This provides
an alternative view on quantum error correction and examples of states whose
lifetime of entanglement (between groups of particles) in fact increases with
the size of the system.

number and the number of spins that make up the state, though only the
coherence number is normally measured. We present a simple set of measurements
that extend our knowledge of the multiple quantum state by recording the
coherences in both the $x$ basis and the usual $z$ basis. The coherences in the
two bases are related by a similarity transformation. We characterize the
growth of the multiple quantum coherences via measurements in the two bases,
and show that the rate varies with the coefficient of the driving term in the
Hamiltonian. Such measurements in non-commuting bases provides additional
information over the 1D method about the state of the spin system. In
particular the measurement of coherences in a basis other than the usual $z$
basis allows us to study the dynamics of the spin system under Hamiltonians,
such as the secular dipolar Hamiltonian, that conserve $z$ basis coherence
number.
