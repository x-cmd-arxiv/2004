binary system SLX 1735-269 during INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic Center
region in 2003. There were detected 6 type I X-ray bursts in total, with one
being much longer and more powerful then others. A strong dependence of the
bursts recurrence time on the mass accretion rate is observed, that is likely
caused by the change in the burning regime. The long burst demonstrated a
photospheric radius expansion. We discuss possible scenarios of this long burst
and show that it is unlikely a carbon burning flash and rather a burst of large
pile of hydrogen and helium accelerated by electron capture processes in a
dense accumulated layer.

hydrogen (HI) dataset of the nearby tidal bridge in the Magellanic System.
Primarily, analyses of the Spatial Power Spectrum suggest that the Magellanic
Bridge, historically considered to be a single contiguous feature, may in fact
be a projection of two kinematically and morphologically distinct structures.
The southern and more obviously turbulent parts appear to show structure
organized similarly to the adjacent Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), while the
northern regions are shown to be relatively deficient in large scale power. The
extent of modification to the spatial power index by the velocity fluctuations
is also highly variant across these parts of the Bridge. We find again that the
northern part appears distinct from the southern part and from the SMC, in that
the power spectrum is significantly more affected by slower velocity
perturbations.
  We also probe the rate of spectral variation of the HI by measuring the
Spectral Correlation Function over selected regions. The results from this
analysis highlight a tendency for the HI spectra within the bright parts of the
Bridge to have a more persistent correlation in the E-W direction than in the
N-S direction. These results are considered to be quantitative evidence for the
tidal processes which are thought to have been active throughout the evolution

out-flowing plasma from the central regions of compact Galactic and
extragalactic X-ray sources. Additionally, it has long been noted that many of
these sources exhibit an ``excess'' continuum component, above 10 keV, usually
attributed to Compton Reflection from a static medium. Motivated by these
facts, as well as by recent observational constraints on the Compton reflection
models - specifically apparently discrepant variability timescales for line and
continuum components in some cases -- we consider possible effects of
out-flowing plasma on the high-energy continuum spectra of accretion powered
compact objects. We present a general formulation for photon downscattering
diffusion which includes recoil and Comptonization effects due to divergence of
the flow. We then develop an analytical theory for the spectral formation in
such systems that allows us to derive formulae for the emergent spectrum.
Finally we perform the analytical model fitting on several Galactic X-ray
binaries. Objects which have been modeled with high-covering-fraction Compton
reflectors, such as GS1353-64 are included in our analysis. In addition, Cyg
X-3, is which is widely believed to be characterized by dense circumstellar
winds with temperature of order 10^6 K, provides an interesting test case. Data
from INTEGRAL and RXTE covering the 3-300 keV range are used in our analysis.
We further consider the possibility that the widely noted distortion of the
power-law continuum above 10 keV may in some cases be explained by these
spectral softening effects.

Algorithms and data are being unified by integrating programming languages with
the database system. This gives an extensible object-relational system where
non-procedural relational operators manipulate object sets. Coupled with this,
each DBMS is now a web service. This has huge implications for how we structure
applications. DBMSs are now object containers. Queues are the first objects to
be added. These queues are the basis for transaction processing and workflow
applica-tions. Future workflow systems are likely to be built on this core.
Data cubes and online analytic processing are now baked into most DBMSs. Beyond
that, DBMSs have a framework for data mining and machine learning algorithms.
Decision trees, Bayes nets, clustering, and time series analysis are built in;
new algorithms can be added. Text, temporal, and spatial data access methods,
along with their probabilistic reasoning have been added to database systems.
Allowing approximate and probabilistic answers is essential for many
applications. Many believe that XML and xQuery will be the main data structure
and access pattern. Database systems must accommodate that perspective.These
changes mandate a much more dynamic query optimization strategy. Intelligence
is moving to the periphery of the network. Each disk and each sensor will be a
competent database machine. Relational algebra is a convenient way to program
these systems. Database systems are now expected to be self-managing,

much improved by a zone and multi-scale zone-pyramid scheme. The approach has

general form of information coding within such sets requires a description by
four-component states. By using Bohr's dictum as a guideline a quantum
mechanical description of the set is obtained in the form of a SO(3,2) based
spin network.
  For large (macroscopic) sub-networks a flat-space approximation of SO(3,2)
leads to a Poincare symmetrical Hilbert space. The concept of a position of
four-component spinors relative to macroscopic sub-networks then delivers the
description of 'free' massive spin-1/2 particles with a Poincare symmetrical
Hilbert space.
  Hence Minkowskian space-time, equipped with spin-1/2 particles, is obtained
as an inherent property of a system of binary elements when individual elements
are described relative to macroscopic sub-systems.

algorithms are the generalization of classical binary search trees to higher
dimensional spaces, so that one may locate near neighbors to an example vector
in $O(\log N)$ time instead of the brute-force O(N) time, with $N$ being the
size of the data base. KDTREE2 is a Fortran 95 module, and a parallel set of
C++ classes which implement tree construction and search routines to find
either a set of $m$ nearest neighbors to an example, or all the neighbors
within some Euclidean distance $r.$ The two versions are independent and
function fully on their own. Considerable care has been taken in the
implementation of the search methods, resulting in substantially higher
computational efficiency (up to an order of magnitude faster) than the author's

rearrangement for memory cache-friendly performance, heap-based priority queues
for large $m$searches, and more effective pruning of search paths by
geometrical constraints to avoid wasted effort. The improvements are the most
potent in the more difficult and slowest cases: larger data base sizes, higher
dimensionality manifolds containing the data set, and larger numbers of
neighbors to search for. The C++ implementation requires the Standard Template

interacting with an electromagnetic field (EMF) initially at finite
temperature. Unlike most earlier studies where the bath is assumed to be fixed,
we study the coherent evolution of the combined qubit-EMF system, thus allowing
for the back-action from the bath on the qubit and the qubit on the bath in a
self-consistent manner. In this way we can see the development of quantum
correlations and entanglement between the system and its environment, and how
that affects the decoherence and relaxation of the system. We find
non-exponential decay for both the diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of
the qubit's reduced density matrix in the pointer basis. From the diagonal
elements we see the qubit relaxes to thermal equilibrium with the bath. From
the non-diagonal elements, we see the decoherence rate beginning at the usually
predicted thermal rate, but changing to the zero temperature decoherence rate
as the qubit and bath become entangled. These two rates are comparable, as was
shown before in the zero temperature case [C. Anastopoulos and B. L. Hu, Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 62} (2000) 033821]. On the entanglement of a qubit with the EMF
under this type of resonant coupling we calculated, for the qubit reduced
density matrix, the fidelity and the von Neumann entropy, which is a measure of
the purity of the density matrix. The present more accurate non-Markovian
calculations predict lower loss of fidelity and purity as compared with the
Markovian results. Generally speaking, with the inclusion of quantum
correlations between the qubit and its environment, the non-Markovian processes
tend to slow down the drive of the system to equilibrium, prolonging the
decoherence and better preserving the fidelity and purity of the system.

wave-packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam-splitter,

the trade-off between low count rates due to narrow filtering and length
fluctuations of the 25km long arms during the measurement. For balanced paths a
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip with a visibility of 47.3% is observed, which is close to
the maximal theoretical value of 50% developed here. This proves the
