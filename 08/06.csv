The
equivalent width of this line is ~100 mA along most of the 5.5-yr cycle and
jumps to ~900 mA just before phase 1.0, followed by a brief disappearance. The
similarity between the intensity variations of this line and of the X-ray light
curve is remarkable, suggesting that they are physically connected. We show
that the number of ionizing photons in the ultraviolet and soft X-rays,
expected to be emitted in the shock wave from the colliding winds, is of the
order of magnitude required to produce the He II emission via photoionization.
  The emission is clearly blueshifted when the line is strong. The radial
velocity of the line is generally -100 Km/s, decreases steadily just before the
event, and reaches -400 Km/s at ph = 1.001. At this point, the velocity
gradient suddenly changes sign, at the same time that the emission intensity
drops to nearly zero. Possible scenarios for explaining this emission are
briefly discussed. The timing of the peak of He II intensity is likely to be
associated to the periastron and may be a reliable fiduciary mark, important
for constraining the orbital parameters.

show that the fast magnetosonic waves propagating across an applied non-uniform
magnetic field can parametrically amplify the Alfven waves propagating along
the field through the periodical variation of the Alfven speed. The resonant
Alfven waves have half the frequency and the perpendicular velocity
polarization of the fast waves. The wave lengths of the resonant waves have
different values across the magnetic field, due to the inhomogeneity in the
Alfven speed. Therefore, if the medium is bounded along the magnetic field,
then the harmonics of the Alfven waves, which satisfy the condition for onset
of a standing pattern, have stronger growth rates. In these regions the fast
magnetosonic waves can be strongly 'absorbed', their energy going in
transversal Alfven waves. We refer to this phenomenon as 'Swing Absorption'.
This mechanism can be of importance in various astrophysical situations.

Galaxy shows structure, which is apparently unrelated to the structure in total
intensity, on many scales. The structure in the polarized emission can be due
to several processes or mechanisms. Some of those are related to the
observational setup, such as beam depolarization -- the vector combination and
(partial) cancellation of polarization vectors within a synthesized beam --, or
the insensitivity of a synthesis telescope to structure on large scales, also
known as the 'missing short spacings problem'. Other causes for structure in
the polarization maps are intrinsic to the radiative transfer of the emission
in the warm ISM, which induces Faraday rotation and depolarization.
  We use data obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope at 5
frequencies near 350 MHz to estimate the importance of the various mechanisms
in producing structure in the linearly polarized emission. In the two regions
studied here, which are both at positive latitudes in the second Galactic
quadrant, the effect of 'missing short spacings' is not important. The
properties of the narrow depolarization 'canals' that are observed in abundance
lead us to conclude that they are mostly due to beam depolarization, and that
they separate regions with different rotation measures. As beam depolarization
only creates structure on the scale of the synthesized beam, most of the
structure on larger scales must be due to depth depolarization. We do not
discuss that aspect of the observations here, but in a companion paper we
derive information about the properties of the ISM from the structure of the
polarized emission.

Due to the growing number of accelerated CRs the expected SNR luminosity
increases during the free expansion phase, reaches a peak value at the
beginning of the Sedov phase and then decreases again, since in this stage the
overall CR number remains nearly constant, whereas the effective magnetic field
diminishes with time. The theoretically predicted brightness-diameter relation

function, we note the strong evolution in space density from the present day to
epochs corresponding to redshifts ~ 1. We draw attention to a selection effect
due to spread in spectral shape that may have misled other investigators to
consider the apparent similarities in shape of luminosity functions in
different redshift shells as evidence for luminosity evolution. To examine the
evolution at redshifts beyond 3, we develop a model-independent method based on
the V_max test using each object to predict expectation densities beyond z=3.
With this we show that a diminution in space density at z > 3 is present at a
significance level >4 sigma. We identify a severe bias in such determinations
from using flux-density measurements at epochs significantly later than that of
the finding survey. The form of the diminution is estimated, and is shown to be
very similar to that found for QSOs selected in X-ray and optical wavebands.
The diminution is also compared with the current estimates of star-formation
evolution, with less conclusive results. In summary we suggest that the
reionization epoch is little influenced by powerful flat-spectrum QSOs, and
that dust obscuration does not play a major role in our view of the QSO

identifications in SN 2002cx. We find that the maximum-light spectra appear to
contain weak features of Si II, S II, Si III, and Ca II, which strengthens the
connection with SN 1991T-like events. We show that later spectra, obtained 12,
25, and 56 days after maximum, consist of P-Cygni resonance-scattering features
due to permitted Fe II and Co II lines. SN 2002cx had been thought to have made
the transition from a permitted-line to a forbidden-line spectrum between 25
and 56 days. Owing to the low expansion velocities the postmaximum spectral
features are narrower and easier to identify than they are in other SNe Ia. SN
2002cx will lead to improved line identifications in other SNe Ia and clarify
when the transition from a permitted-line to a forbidden-line spectrum occurs.
In the context of current SN Ia explosion models, we suggest that the
properties of SN 2002cx may be consistent with 3D deflagration models, which
are not favored for normal SNe Ia.

spin transport in bulk semiconductors and semiconductor microstructures. This
interaction couples electron spin to dc and ac electric fields. Spin coupling
to ac electric fields allows efficient spin manipulating by the electric
component of electromagnetic field through the electric dipole spin resonance
(EDSR) mechanism. Usually, it is much more efficient than the magnetic
manipulation due to a larger coupling constant and the easier access to spins
at a nanometer scale. The dependence of the EDSR intensity on the magnetic
field direction allows measuring the relative strengths of the competing SO
coupling mechanisms in quantum wells. Spin coupling to an in-plane electric
field is much stronger than to a perpendicular field. Because electron bands in
microstructures are spin split by SO interaction, electron spin is not
conserved and spin transport in them is controlled by a number of competing
parameters, hence, it is rather nontrivial. The relation between spin
transport, spin currents, and spin populations is critically discussed.
Importance of transients and sharp gradients for generating spin magnetization
by electric fields and for ballistic spin transport is clarified.

wavefront is insensitive to details of the packing: force chains do not play an
important role in determining this wavefront. The coherent wave propagates
linearly in time, and its amplitude and width depend as a power law on
distance, while its velocity is roughly compatible with the predictions of
macroscopic elasticity. As there is at present no theory for the broadening and
decay of the coherent wave, we numerically and analytically study
pulse-propagation in a one-dimensional chain of identical elastic balls. The
results for the broadening and decay exponents of this system differ
significantly from those of the random packings. In all our simulations, the

interest. Here we consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of
elementary subsystems with nearest neighbour interactions and assume that the
total system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyse, under
what condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices
with respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the
same temperature $T$. In quantum systems the minimal group size
$n_{\textrm{min}}$ depends on the temperature $T$, contrary to the classical
case. As examples, we apply our analysis to a harmonic chain and different
types of Ising spin chains. For the harmonic chain, which successfully
describes thermal properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first
quantitative estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can
exist: This length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the
Debye temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below. We finally apply the
harmonic chain model to various materials of relevance for technical
applications and discuss the results. These show that, indeed, high
temperatures can exist quite locally, while low temperatures exist on larger
scales only. This has striking consequences: In quasi 1-dimensional systems,

is a primary resource: the useful lifetime of the network is constrained by its
ability to store the generated data samples. We explore the use of
collaborative storage technique to efficiently manage data in storage
constrained sensor networks. The proposed collaborative storage technique takes
advantage of spatial correlation among the data collected by nearby sensors to
significantly reduce the size of the data near the data sources. We show that
the proposed approach provides significant savings in the size of the stored
data vs. local buffering, allowing the network to run for a longer time without
running out of storage space and reducing the amount of data that will
eventually be relayed to the observer. In addition, collaborative storage
performs load balancing of the available storage space if data generation rates
are not uniform across sensors (as would be the case in an event driven sensor
network), or if the available storage varies across the network.

one loop nonplanar (NP) diagrams in noncommutative (NC) field theory. The
conventional wisdom says that, barring the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing
problem, NP diagrams whose planar counterparts are UV divergent are rendered
finite by NC phases that couple the loop momentum to the external NC momentum
\rho^{\mu}=\theta^{\mu\nu}p_{\nu}. We show that this is generally not the case.
We find that subtleties arise already on Euclidean spacetime. The situation is
even worse in Minkowski spacetime due to its indefinite metric. We compare
different prescriptions that may be used to evaluate loop integrals in ordinary
theory. They are equivalent in the sense that they always yield identical
results. However, in NC theory there is no a priori reason that these
prescriptions, except for the defining one built in Feynman propagator, are
physically justified. Employing them can lead to ambiguous results. For
\rho^2>0, the NC phase can worsen the UV property of loop integrals instead of
always improving it in high dimensions. We explain how this surprising
phenomenon comes about from the indefinite metric. For \rho^2<0, the NC phase
improves the UV property and softens the quadratic UV divergence in ordinary
theory to a bounded but indefinite UV oscillation. We employ a cut-off method
to quantify the new UV non-regular terms. For \rho^2>0, these terms are
generally complex and thus also harm unitarity. As the new terms are not
available in the Lagrangian, our result casts doubts on previous demonstrations
of one loop renormalizability based exclusively upon analysis of planar
diagrams, especially in theories with quadratic divergences.

associated Schrodinger operator plays three very important interconnected
roles, which we explore perturbatively and non-perturbatively. On one hand, it
acts as a source for placing D-branes and fluxes into the background, while on
the other, it acts as a probe of the background, its first integral yielding
the effective force on a scaled eigenvalue. We study this probe at disc, torus
and annulus order in perturbation theory, in order to characterize the effects
of D-branes and fluxes on the matrix eigenvalues. On a third hand, the
integrated resolvent forms a representation of a twisted boson in an associated
conformal field theory. The entire content of the closed string theory can be
expressed in terms of Virasoro constraints on the partition function, which is
realized as wavefunction in a coherent state of the boson. Remarkably, the
D-brane or flux background is simply prepared by acting with a vertex operator
of the twisted boson. This generates a number of sharp examples of open-closed
duality, both old and new. We discuss whether the twisted boson conformal field
theory can usefully be thought of as another holographic dual of the

present a new approach to the computation of d-dimensional cubature formulae.
It is well known that the nodes of 1-dimensional Gaussian quadrature can be
computed as eigenvalues of the so-called Jacobi matrix. The d-dimensional
analog is that cubature nodes can be obtained from the eigenvalues of certain
mutually commuting matrices. These are obtained by extending (adding rows and
columns to) certain noncommuting matrices A_1,...,A_d, related to the
coordinate operators x_1,...,x_d, in R^d. We prove a correspondence between
cubature formulae and ""commuting extensions"" of A_1,...,A_d, satisfying a
compatibility condition which, in appropriate coordinates, constrains certain
blocks in the extended matrices to be zero. Thus the problem of finding
cubature formulae can be transformed to the problem of computing (and then
simultaneously diagonalizing) commuting extensions. We give a general
discussion of existence and of the expected size of commuting extensions and

Hartree-Fock method for medium and heavy nuclei by applying effective field
theory (EFT) methods to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). When
conventional Kohn-Sham DFT for Coulomb systems is extended beyond the local
density approximation, the kinetic energy density tau is sometimes included in
energy functionals in addition to the fermion density. However, a local
(semi-classical) expansion of tau is used to write the energy as a functional
of the density alone, in contrast to the Skyrme approach. The difference is
manifested in different single-particle equations, which in the Skyrme case
include a spatially varying effective mass. Here we show how to generalize the
EFT framework for DFT derived previously to reconcile these approaches. A
dilute gas of fermions with short-range interactions confined by an external
potential serves as a model system for comparisons and for testing
power-counting estimates of new contributions to the energy functional.

Bethe-Salpeter equations are briefly surveyed using an intuitive model. The
model allows one to elucidate why a linear extrapolation to the chiral limit of
extant lattice data on the dressed-quark mass-function overestimates this
function and hence the value of the vacuum quark condensate. The diagrammatic
content of the vertex described is explicitly enumerable. This property is
essential to the symmetry preserving study of bound state properties. It
facilitates a realistic analysis of vector and pseudoscalar meson masses, and
also allows the accuracy of standard truncations to be gauged. The splitting
between vector and pseudoscalar meson masses is observed to vanish as the
current-quark mass increases. That argues for the mass of the pseudoscalar
partner of the Upsilon(1S) to be above 9.4GeV. Moreover, in this limit the
rainbow-ladder truncation provides an increasingly accurate estimate of a bound
state's mass.

observables in a hidden-variable model for quantum events must commute
simultaneously. In this comment, we discuss that Malley's theorem is indeed
valid for the hidden-variable theoretical assumptions, which were introduced by
Kochen and Specker. However, we give an example that the local hidden-variable
(LHV) model for quantum events preserves noncommutativity of quantum
observables. It turns out that Malley's theorem is not related with the LHV
model for quantum events, in general.

optical transitions, which are each placed in a cavity and subsequently
entangled using a double-heralded single-photon detection scheme. The fidelity
of the resulting entanglement is extremely robust against the most important
errors such as detector loss, spontaneous emission, and mismatch of cavity
parameters. We demonstrate how this entangling operation can be used to
efficiently generate cluster states of many qubits, which, together with single
qubit operations and readout, can be used to implement universal quantum
computation. Existing experimental parameters indicate that high fidelity
clusters can be generated with a moderate constant overhead.

performed on them. Gate operations can be repeated until a success is heralded
without destroying the qubits at any stage of the operation. In contrast to
other schemes, this does not require explicit qubit-qubit interactions, a
priori entangled ancillas nor the feeding of photons into photon sources.

A71 (2005) 022106","10.1103/PhysRevA.71.022106",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a new way to compute and interpret quantum tunneling in a 1-D
double-well potential. For large transition time we show that the quantum
action functional gives an analytical expression for tunneling amplitudes. This
has been confirmed by numerical simulations giving relative errors in the order
of 1e-5. In contrast to the classical potential, the quantum potential has a
triple-well if the classical wells are deep enough. Its minima are located at
the position of extrema of the ground state wave function. The striking feature
is that a single trajectory with a double instanton reproduces the tunneling
amplitude. This is in contrast to the standard instanton approach, where
infinitely many instantons and anti-instatons have to be taken into account.
The quantum action functional is valid in the deep quantum regime in contrast
to the semi-classical regime where the standard instanton approach holds. We
compare both approaches via numerical simulations. While the standard instanton
picture describes only the transition between potential minima of equal depth,
the quantum action may give rise to instantons also for asymmetric potential
minima. Such case is illustrated by an example.
