important. Including lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)
effects, and extragalactic point sources, we simulate the telescope's
observations of the CMB in three channels, then extract the power spectra of
these components in a multifrequency analysis. We present results for various
cases, differing in assumed knowledge of the contaminating point sources. We
find that both radio and infrared point sources are important, but can be
effectively eliminated from the power spectrum given three (or more) channels
and a good understanding of their frequency dependence. However, improper
treatment of the scatter in the point source frequency dependence relation may
introduce a large systematic bias. Even if all thermal SZ and point source
effects are eliminated, the kinetic SZ effect remains and corrupts measurements
of the primordial slope and amplitude on small scales. We discuss the
non-Gaussianity of the one-point probability distribution function as a way to
constrain the kinetic SZ effect, and we develop a method for distinguishing
this effect from the CMB in a window where they overlap. This method provides
an independent constraint on the variance of the CMB in that window and is
complementary to the power spectrum analysis.

fields is investigated by high-resolution numerical simulation. Outflow
formation in the collapsing cloud cores is also followed. In the models
examined, the cloud core and parent cloud rotate rigidly and are initially
threaded by a uniform magnetic field. The simulations show that the cloud core
collapses along the magnetic field lines. The magnetic field in the dense
region of the cloud core rotates faster than that of the parent cloud as a
consequence of spin-up of the central region during the collapse. The cloud
core exhibits significant precession of the rotation axis, magnetic field, and
disk orientation, with precession highest in the models with low initial field
strength ($\lesssim 20 \mu {\rm G}$). Precession in models with initial fields
of $\sim 40 \mu {\rm G}$ is suppressed by strong magnetic braking. Magnetic
braking transfers angular momentum form the central region and acts more
strongly on the component of angular momentum oriented perpendicular to the
magnetic field. After the formation of an adiabatic core, outflow is ejected
along the local magnetic field lines. Strong magnetic braking associated with
the outflow causes the direction of angular momentum to converge with that of
the local magnetic field, resulting in the convergence of the local magnetic
field, angular momentum, outflow, and disk orientation by the outflow formation
phase. The magnetic field of a young star is inclined at an angle of no more
than $30^\circ$ from that of the parent cloud at initial field strengths of
$\sim 20 \mu {\rm G}$, while at an initial field strength of $\sim 40 \mu {\rm
G}$, the magnetic field of the young star is well aligned with that of the

heavily obscured AGN. We combine X-ray luminosity functions with appropriate
spectral energy distributions for AGN to model the X-ray, optical and

simple model based on the unified paradigm for AGN, with ~3 times as many

inferred from optical and near-IR spectroscopy, probably largely due to strong
spectroscopic selection biases. By stacking all undetected DRGs we find that
their average X-ray flux in the 0.5-8 keV band is ~4.6x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2. The
detection is only significant in the soft and full energy bands. The mean
detection may result from star formation, the presence of low luminosity AGN,

formation, we find an average instantaneous star formation rate of 214 +- 68
(random) +- 73 (systematic) solar masses per year, in excellent agreement with
previous results from spectral energy distribution fitting when constant star
formation histories are assumed. These results may imply that DRGs contribute
significantly to the cosmic star formation rate at z~2.5. However, the mean

Ton 202 in both epochs, the polarized flux is considered to originate interior
to the broad emission line region. The Balmer edge feature seen in the
polarized flux is most simply interpreted as an intrinsic spectral feature of
the quasar UV/optical continuum, or the ``Big Blue Bump'' emission. In this

optically-thick nature of the continuum emitted. However, we also discuss other

close proximity to a quantum critical point that separates a pure

competing order. We further suggests that the relevant competing order is
likely a spin-density wave (SDW) or a charge density wave (CDW), which can
couple to an in-plane Cu-O bond stretching longitudinal optical (LO) phonon

functions of the initial concentration of the solute, the initial geometry of
the drop, and the time elapsed from the beginning of the drying process. The
model is solved analytically for small initial concentrations of the solute and
numerically for arbitrary initial concentrations of the solute. The agreement
between our theoretical results and the experimental data is demonstrated, and
it is shown that the observed dependence of the deposit dimensions on the
experimental parameters can indeed be attributed to the finite dimensions of

fluctuations[3,4]. Felix Bloch noted in 1946 that statistical fluctuations of N
paramagnetic spins should generate measurable noise of order \sqrt{N} spins,
even in zero magnetic field[5,6]. Here we address precisely these same spin
fluctuations, using off-resonant Faraday rotation to passively[7,8] ""listen"" to
the magnetization noise in an equilibrium ensemble of paramagnetic alkali

precess and decay with the same characteristic energy and time scales as the
macroscopic magnetization of an intentionally polarized or driven ensemble.
Correlation spectra of the measured spin noise reveals g-factors, nuclear spin,
isotope abundance ratios, hyperfine splittings, nuclear moments, and spin
coherence lifetimes -- without having to excite, optically pump, or otherwise
drive the system away from thermal equilibrium. These noise signatures scale
inversely with interaction volume, suggesting routes towards non-perturbative,

the intershell tunnelling. We provide benchmark results for R_{21}=V_2/I_1

gives rise to strongly chirality dependent suppression effects for the Coulomb
drag between different tubes due to selection rules combined with mismatching
of wave vector and crystal angular momentum conservation near the Fermi level.
This gives rise to orders of magnitude changes in R_{21} and even the sign of

misalignment of inner and outer tube Fermi levels. However for any tube

allowed in the quantum world. It is known that quantum mechanics allows pair
creation at the horizon (one particle inside, another particle outside) and
Hawking radiation. One can extend this idea to propose other processes.
Tunneling of an external particle inside black hole may be produced by the
creation of a pair at the horizon, followed by the annihilation of one created
particle with the initial particle outside, with the other created particle
appearing inside. Escape of a particle from a black hole may result from the
creation of a pair, followed by the annihilation of one created particle with

escape may allow the transfer of information to the outside.Finally, the

individual fermion eigenmodes, because this provides a natural way to filter
out UV fluctuations. The double-peaking in the distribution of the local chiral
orientation parameter (X) has been offered as evidence, by some, in support of
a particular model of the vacuum. Here we caution that the X-distribution
peaking varies significantly with various versions of the definition of X.
Furthermore, each distribution varies little from that resulting from a random
reshuffling of the left-handed (and independently the right-handed) fields,
which destroys any QCD-induced left-right correlation; that is, the
double-peaking is mostly a phase-space effect. We propose a new universal
definition of the X parameter whose distribution is uniform for randomly
reshuffled fields. Any deviations from uniformity for actual data can then be
directly attributable to QCD-induced dynamics. We find that the familiar double
peak disappears.

conformal symmetry as a template, systematically correcting for its nonzero
$\beta$ function as well as higher-twist effects. For example, commensurate
scale relations which relate QCD observables to each other, such as the
generalized Crewther relation, have no renormalization scale or scheme
ambiguity and retain a convergent perturbative structure which reflects the
underlying conformal symmetry of the classical theory. The ``conformal
correspondence principle"" also dictates the form of the expansion basis for
hadronic distribution amplitudes. The AdS/CFT correspondence connecting
superstring theory to superconformal gauge theory has important implications
for hadron phenomenology in the conformal limit, including an all-orders
demonstration of counting rules for hard exclusive processes as well as
determining essential aspects of hadronic light-front wavefunctions.
Theoretical and phenomenological evidence is now accumulating that QCD
couplings based on physical observables such as tau decay become constant at
small virtuality; i.e., effective charges develop an infrared fixed point in
contradiction to the usual assumption of singular growth in the infrared. The
near-constant behavior of effective couplings also suggests that QCD can be
approximated as a conformal theory even at relatively small momentum transfer.
The importance of using an analytic effective charge such as the pinch scheme
for unifying the electroweak and strong couplings and forces is also
emphasized.

depends on a beam size. ODR generated by extremely ultrarelativistic beam
passing through a narrow slit may be used to determine the beam size from ODR

the density to levels in excess of 1x10^15 cm^-3. The resulting clouds are

enable mesoscopic quantum manipulation using Rydberg blockade and have the high

investigated using a stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infective-Recovered) model on
complex networks. It was found that in addition to the reduction of the
effective transmission rate, through the screening of infectives, spatial
correlations may have another major effect through the enhancement of
stochastic fluctuations. As a consequence large populations will have to become
even larger to 'average out' significant differences from the solution of
deterministic models. Furthermore, time series of the (unforced) model provide
patterns of recurrent epidemics with slightly irregular periods and realistic
amplitudes, suggesting that stochastic models together with complex networks of
contacts may be sufficient to describe the long term dynamics of some diseases.
The spatial effects were analysed quantitatively by modelling measles and
pertussis, using a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered) model. Both
the period and the spatial coherence of the epidemic peaks of pertussis are
well described by the unforced model for realistic values of the parameters.

abstract perspective of quantum computing. For us, a hidden-variable theory is
simply a way to convert a unitary matrix that maps one quantum state to
another, into a stochastic matrix that maps the initial probability
distribution to the final one in some fixed basis. We list seven axioms that we
might want such a theory to satisfy, and then investigate which of the axioms
can be satisfied simultaneously. Toward this end, we construct a new
hidden-variable theory that is both robust to small perturbations and
indifferent to the identity operation, by exploiting an unexpected connection
between unitary matrices and network flows. We also analyze previous
hidden-variable theories of Dieks and Schrodinger in terms of our axioms. In a
companion paper, we will show that actually sampling the history of a hidden
variable under reasonable axioms is at least as hard as solving the Graph
Isomorphism problem; and indeed is probably intractable even for quantum
computers.

expectation value over an infinite class of different generalized Kirkwood

exceeds the eigenvalue spectrum of the observable can only be found if the
Terletsky-Margenau-Hill distribution is negative, or, equivalently, if the real
part of the weak value of the density operator is negative. We find that a
classical model of a weak measurement exists whenever the
Terletsky-Margenau-Hill representation of the observable equals the classical
representation of the observable and the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill distribution
is nonnegative. Strange weak values alone are not sufficient to obtain a
contradiction with classical models.
  We propose feasible weak measurements of photon number of the radiation
field. Negative weak values of energy contradicts all classical stochastic
models, whereas negative weak values of photon number contradict all classical
stochastic models where the energy is bounded from below by the zero-point
energy. We examine coherent states in particular, and find negative weak values
with probabilities of 16% for kinetic energy (or squared field quadrature), 8%
for harmonic oscillator energy and 50% for photon number. These experiments are
robust against detector inefficiency and thermal noise.
