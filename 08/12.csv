group of galaxies. NGC 5171 is unusual in that it is an X-ray bright group (L >
10^42 erg/s), with irregular contours which are not centred on a bright galaxy.
The global spectrum is adequately described by a single temperature APEC model
with T = 0.96 +/- 0.04 keV, and Z = 0.13 +/- 0.02 Zsol, in good agreement with
previous ROSAT data. We find the X-ray contours are centred on a bright ridge
of emission stretching from the BGG to a nearby galaxy. Spectral mapping
reveals this ridge to be both cool (T ~ 1.1 keV) and metallic (Z ~ 0.4 Zsol) in
comparison to its surrounding, suggesting it is the result of a tidal
interaction between the two galaxies. Optical data reveals the member galaxies
to have a high velocity dispersion (sigma = 494 +/- 99 km/s), and a
significantly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, suggesting the group is in
the process of merging. A region of hot gas with T = 1.58 +/- 0.36 keV is found
to the West of the bright central ridge, and we interpret this as shock-heating
resulting from the merging. A further region of emission to the South-East of
the bright central ridge, with T = 1.14 +/- 0.13 keV, is probably associated
with a background group, four times more distant.

radial variation of the LFs. The LF of the tidal tails is distinctly enhanced
with faint, low-mass stars. Pal 5 exhibits a binary main sequence, and we
estimate a photometric binary frequency of roughly 10%. Also the binaries show
evidence of mass segregation with more massive binary systems being more
strongly concentrated toward the cluster center.

``ezdiskbb,'' which we compare to the nonzero-torque model diskbb by fitting
RXTE spectra of three well-known black hole binaries: 4U 1543-47, XTE

implications, especially for the determination of black-hole angular momentum

`pile-up' distribution in order to explain the time-averaged high energy

synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission (SSC) of ultra-relativistic
leptons. The particle energy distribution function (EDF) is computed in a
self-consistent way, taking into account an injection term of fresh particles,
a possible pair creation term, and the particles radiative cooling. The source
term is not a usual power-law but rather a `pile-up' distribution, which can
result from the combination of a stochastic heating via second order Fermi
process and radiative cooling. To validate this approach, we have performed
time-averaged fits of the well-known TeV emitter Mrk 501 during the 1997
flaring activity period taking into account the attenuation of the high energy
component by cosmic diffuse infrared background (DIrB) and intrinsic absorption
via the pair creation process. The model can reproduce very satisfactorily the
observed spectral energy distribution (SED). A high Lorentz factor is required
to avoid strong pair production; in the case of smaller Lorentz factor, an
intense flare in the GeV range is predicted due to the sudden increase of soft
photons density below the Klein-Nishina threshold. The possible relevance of
such a scenario is discussed.

CC and CM diagrams, we identified a rich population of YSOs (Class I and Class
II), associated with the NGC 7538 region. A large number of red sources (H-K >
2) have also been detected around NGC 7538. We argue that these red stars are
most probably PMS stars with intrinsic color excesses. Most of YSOs in NGC 7538
are arranged from the N-W toward S-E regions, forming a sequence in age: the
diffuse H II region (N-W, oldest: where most of the Class II and Class I
sources are detected); the compact IR core (center); and the regions with the
extensive IR reflection nebula and a cluster of red young stars (S-E and S). We
find that the slope of the KLF of NGC 7538 is lower than the typical values
reported for the young embedded clusters, although equally low values have also
been reported in the W3 Main star forming region. From the slope of the KLF and
the analysis by Megeath et al. (1996), we infer that the embedded stellar
population is comprised of YSOs with an age of ~ 1 Myr. Based on the comparison
between models of PMS stars with the observed CM diagram we find that the
stellar population in NGC 7538 is primarily composed of low mass PMS stars
similar to those observed in the W3 Main star forming region.

an iron poor analogue of the better studied Hyades and Praecepe open clusters,
was announced. This unique star was thought to be the smoking gun for the
action of diffusion, models of which predict a narrow ""Li-peak"" at
approximately the correct temperature. However, with more detailed studies into
J37s abundance pattern this star provides firm evidence for the accretion of
planetesimals or other material from the circumstellar environment of new born
stars.
  Thanks to the specific predictions made about the behaviour of Be abundances,
(the most striking of which being no Be in super-Li-rich dwarfs subject to
diffusion) the opposing diffusion/accretion predictions can be tested.
  Initial modelling of the Be line indicates that J37 is as Be rich as it is Li
rich; log N(Be) = 2.25 +/- 0.25, and so is broadly consistent with an
accretion-fuelled enhancement. However, that both Li and Be are enhanced by
much more than the iron-peak elements (as determined in previous studies)
suggests that diffusion also plays a role in increasing the abundances of Li
and Be specifically.
  Furthermore, a new data set from the UVES/UT2 combination has allowed the
elemental abundance of Iron to be measured, and the set of preliminary stellar
parameters determined; Teff ~ 7340 K, log g ~ 4.1, microturbulence ~ 4.3 km/s,
[Fe/H] ~ 0.50. This again provides distinct evidence for the effects of
accretion in J37 and requires a new synthesis of the Be doublet.

in colliding wind binaries, providing new insights into the structure and
dynamics of the X-ray-emitting regions. We present the key results of new
analyses of high-resolution Chandra X-ray spectra of two important colliding
wind systems, Gamma Velorum and WR140. The lines of Gamma Vel are essentially
unshifted from their rest wavelengths, which we suggest is evidence of a wide
shock opening angle, indicative of sudden radiative braking. The widths of the
lines of WR140 are correlated with ionization potential, implying
non-equilibrium ionization. The implications of these results for the radio
emission from these systems are discussed, as are some of the future directions
for X-ray line profile modelling of colliding wind binaries.

estimate the contribution of the pulsar B0656+14 to the cosmic rays in the PeV

there and an SNR is still needed.
  We also examine the possibility of the pulsar giving the peak of the
extensive air shower intensity observed from the region inside the Monogem

systems, defined as binaries with early type primaries on the main-sequence
(MS) and late-type secondaries on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. The
importance of this study in comparison with previous ones is that the Lindroos
sample is not X-ray selected so we avoid a possible bias towards fast rotators.
In this preliminary study we have monitored eleven stars in the UBVRI bands
during two campaigns of ten consecutive nights each. Eight of the observed
PTTSs show periodic modulations in their lightcurves and the derived periods
range from 1.9d to 8.0d. The comparison of these results with theoretical
rotational tracks based on disk-star locking theory shows that star-disk
decoupling times of 1-20 Myr could reproduce the rotational properties of the
targets, assuming an initial rotation period of ~8d and a mass of 1 Mo. We have
studied the rotation-activity relations of Lindroos PTTSs and compared them
with those found in other groups of PMS and zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) ~1 Mo
stars. The Lindroos sample displays activity-rotation relations very similar to
those found in TTSs. It contains a mixture of very active stars, with Lx/Lbol
ratios close to the saturation level of -3, and less active (unsaturated)
stars. This could be the result of different star-disk decoupling times. Future
monitoring of a larger and unbiased sample of PTTS will be important to confirm
the significance of these results.

of 10^4 with 10% Im galaxies and one Sm system having no measurable star

substantial evidence for these processes among many surveys of BCDs. The star

  Astronomical Society",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.08187.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Three component models of the IMF are made to consider possible origins for
the observed relative variations in the numbers of brown dwarfs,
solar-to-intermediate mass stars, and high mass stars. Three distinct physical
processes are noted. The characteristic mass for most star formation is
identified with the thermal Jeans mass in the molecular cloud core, and this
presumably leads to the middle mass range by the usual collapse and accretion
processes. Pre-stellar condensations (PSCs) observed in mm-wave continuum
studies presumably form at this mass. Significantly smaller self-gravitating
masses require much larger pressures and may arise following dynamical
processes inside these PSCs, including disk formation, tight-cluster ejection,
and photoevaporation as studied elsewhere, but also gravitational collapse of
shocked gas in colliding PSCs. Significantly larger stellar masses form in
relatively low abundance by normal cloud processes, possibly leading to steep
IMFs in low-pressure field regions, but this mass range can be significantly
extended in high pressure cloud cores by gravitationally-focussed gas accretion
onto PSCs and by the coalescence of PSCs. These models suggest that the
observed variations in brown dwarf, solar-to-intermediate mass, and high mass
populations are the result of dynamical effects that depend on environmental
density and velocity dispersion. They accommodate observations ranging from
shallow IMFs in cluster cores to Salpeter IMFs in average clusters and whole
galaxies to steep and even steeper IMFs in field and remote field regions. They
also suggest how the top-heavy IMFs in some starburst clusters may originate
and they explain bottom-heavy IMFs in low surface brightness galaxies.

excellent agreement between the calculated and measured curves was obtained in

Under oxygen-absent annealing atmosphere, the electric resistances of the grain
boundaries changed greatly but the resistance of the grains has almost no
change. While under oxygen annealing atmosphere, the reverse happened. On the
basis of this result, it is demonstrated that the origin of the
semiconductivity of the grains in CCTO polycrystalline films arises from their
oxygen-loss, while the grain boundaries are close to oxygen- stoicheometry.

We show that, given {\it any} spectrum of perturbations, it is possible to

spectrum with the standard dynamics. We provide an explicit construction of the
quantum state which will produce the given spectrum. We find that the various
modified spectra that have been recently obtained from `trans-Planckian

predicted to lie within roughly the N-Delta splitting of the J=1/2 positive
parity ground state while, for the CM model, 10 states are expected in the same
range. Both the lowest excitation energy and the relative splittings are much
smaller in the CM case. These predictions are on the same footing as those for
the analogous splittings in the non-exotic baryon sector and, as such, provide
a means of not only testing the models, but potentially ruling out either one,

compare with the S-U and Pb-Pb data presented by the NA50 Collaboration. From
data at low centrality we find T=160-180 MeV, close to the predicted
temperature of the transition to quark-gluon plasma and to the temperatures
measured by hadron abundances. We extrapolate to higher centralities with the
approximation of scaling the energy density of the fireball with the average
baryon density per unit transverse area. Using the energy-temperature relation
of the hadron gas made by the same pseudoscalar and vector mesons, the fall off
of J/psi production shown by the NA50 data, can be marginally reproduced only
for the highest temperature, T=180 MeV. If we use the energy-temperature
relation of a Hagedorn gas with limiting temperature T_H=173 MeV, predictions
fall short from reproducing the data. These results suggest that a different
mechanism is responsible for the J/psi suppression at large centralities, which
could very well be the formation of quark-gluon plasma.

show directed ballistic transport in the absence of an average force. We

phase space, and elucidate a sum rule that relates the contributions of
different phase-space components to transport with each other. We show that
regular ratchet transport can be directed against an external potential
gradient while chaotic ballistic transport is restricted to unbiased systems.
For quantized Hamiltonian ratchets we study transport in terms of the evolution
of wave packets and derive a semiclassical expression for the distribution of
level velocities which encode the quantum transport in the Floquet band
spectra. We discuss the role of dynamical tunneling between transporting
islands and the chaotic sea and the breakdown of transport in quantum ratchets

velocity vector in the diffracting material can be either co-parallel or
anti-parallel to the time-averaged Poynting vector, thereby allowing for the
material to be classified as of either the positive or the negative negative
phase-velocity (PPV or NPV) type. Three methods used for analyzing dielectric
gratings - the Rayleigh-hypothesis method, a perturbative approach, and the C

consideration of field representation inside the refracting half--space.
Corrugations of both symmetric as well as asymmetric shapes are studied, as
also the diversity of grating response to the linear polarization states of the
incident plane wave. The replacement of PPV grating by its NPV analog affects
only nonspecular diffraction efficiencies when the corrugations are shallow,
and the effect on specular diffraction efficiencies intensifies as the
corrugations deepen. Whether the type of the refracting material is NPV or PPV

whether a certain subset of Siegert pseudostates comprises a basis. This is a
nontrivial issue, because of the unusual orthogonality and overcompleteness
properties of Siegert pseudostates. Using analytical and numerical arguments,
it is shown that the subset of bound states and outgoing Siegert pseudostates
forms a basis. Time evolution in the context of Siegert pseudostates is also
investigated. From the Mittag-Leffler expansion of the outgoing-wave Green's

insights into protein evolution. We study the architecture of the protein
domain universe, which has been found to poses peculiar scale-free properties
(Dokholyan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99: 14132-14136 (2002)). We
examine the origin of these scale-free properties of the graph of protein
domain structures (PDUG) and determine that that the PDUG is not modular, i.e.
it does not consist of modules with uniform properties. Instead, we find the
PDUG to be self-similar at all scales. We further characterize the PDUG
architecture by studying the properties of the hub nodes that are responsible
for the scale-free connectivity of the PDUG. We introduce a measure of the
betweenness centrality of protein domains in the PDUG and find a power-law
distribution of the betweenness centrality values. The scale-free distribution
of hubs in the protein universe suggests that a set of specific statistical
mechanics models, such as the self-organized criticality model, can potentially
identify the principal driving forces of molecular evolution. We also find a
gatekeeper protein domain, removal of which partitions the largest cluster into
two large sub-clusters. We suggest that the loss of such gatekeeper protein
domains in the course of evolution is responsible for the creation of new fold
families.

set into one that can be efficiently modelled classically. This question is
useful for providing upper bounds on fault tolerant thresholds, and for
understanding the nature of the quantum/classical computational transition. We
refine some previously known upper bounds using two different strategies. The
first one involves the introduction of bi-entangling operations, a class of
classically simulatable machines that can generate at most bipartite
entanglement. Using this class we show that it is possible to sharpen
previously obtained upper bounds in certain cases. As an example, we show that
under depolarizing noise on the controlled-not gate, the previously known upper
bound of 74% can be sharpened to around 67%. Another interesting consequence is
that measurement based schemes cannot work using only 2-qubit non-degenerate
projections. In the second strand of the work we utilize the Gottesman-Knill
theorem on the classically efficient simulation of Clifford group operations.
The bounds attained for the pi/8 gate using this approach can be as low as 15%
for general single gate noise, and 30% for dephasing noise.

entanglement they can provide between the nearest and the next to nearest
neighbor spins in the ground state. We then investigate whether this
entanglement can be optimized by allowing the system to interact through a
weighted combination of the star and the ring geometries. We find that such a
weighted combination is indeed optimal in certain circumstances for providing
the highest entanglement between two chosen spins. The entanglement shows jumps
and counterintuitive behavior as the relative weighting of the star and the
ring interactions is varied. We give an exact mathematical explanation of the
behavior for a five qubit system (four spins in a ring and a central spin) and
an intuitive explanation for larger systems. For the case of four spins in a
ring plus a central spin, we demonstrate how a four qubit GHZ state can be
generated as a simple derivative of the ground state. Our calculations also
demonstrate that some of the multi-particle entangled states derivable from the
ground state of a star network are sufficiently robust to the presence of
nearest neighbor ring interactions.

Hamiltonian is a well-studied problem. Combinatorial schemes for decoupling and
for manipulating the couplings of Hamiltonians have been developed which use
selective pulses. In this paper we consider an additional requirement on these
pulse sequences: as few {\em different} control operations as possible should
be used. This requirement is motivated by the fact that optimizing each
individual selective pulse will be expensive, i. e., it is desirable to use as
few different selective pulses as possible. For an arbitrary $d$-dimensional
system we show that the ability to implement only two control operations is
sufficient to turn off the time evolution. In case of a bipartite system with
local control we show that four different control operations are sufficient.
Turning to networks consisting of several $d$-dimensional nodes which are
governed by a pair-interaction Hamiltonian, we show that decoupling can be
achieved if one is able to control a number of different control operations
which is logarithmic in the number of nodes.

Previous to define this distinguishability criterium, we review some of the
