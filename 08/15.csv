thought to have been captured into planetocentric orbits after straying into a
region in which the planet's gravitation dominates solar perturbations (the
Hill sphere). This mechanism requires a source of dissipation, such as
gas-drag, in order to make capture permanent. However, capture by gas-drag
requires that particles remain inside the Hill sphere long enough for
dissipation to be effective. Recently we have proposed that in the circular
restricted three-body problem particles may become caught up in `sticky'
chaotic layers which tends to prolong their sojourn within the planet's Hill
sphere thereby assisting capture. Here we show that this mechanism survives
perturbations due to the ellipticity of the planet's orbit. However, Monte
Carlo simulations indicate that the planet's ability to capture moons decreases
with increasing orbital eccentricity. At the actual Jupiter's orbital
eccentricity, this effects in approximately an order of magnitude lower capture
probability than estimated in the circular model. Eccentricities of planetary
orbits in the Solar System are moderate but this is not necessarily the case
for extrasolar planets which typically have rather eccentric orbits. Therefore,
our findings suggest that these extrasolar planets are unlikely to have
substantial populations of irregular moons.

  Updated references, somewhat improved fits and some clarifications in text",,,"IEKP-KA/2004-19","astro-ph hep-ph",,"  The diffuse galactic EGRET gamma ray data show a clear excess for energies
above 1 GeV in comparison with the expectations from conventional galactic
models. The excess is seen with the same spectrum in all sky directions, as
expected for Dark Matter (DM) annihilation. This hypothesis is investigated in
detail. The energy spectrum of the excess is used to limit the WIMP mass to the
50-100 GeV range, while the sky maps are used to determine the halo structure,
which is consistent with a triaxial isothermal halo with additional enhancement
of Dark Matter in the disc. The latter is strongly correlated with the ring of
stars around our galaxy at a distance of 14 kpc, thought to originate from the
tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy. It is shown that this ring of DM with a
mass of $\approx 2\cdot 10^{11} M_\odot$ causes the mysterious change of slope
in the rotation curve at $R=1.1R_0$ and the large local surface density of the
disc. The total mass of the halo is determined to be $3\cdot 10^{12} M_\odot$.
A cuspy profile is definitely excluded to describe the gamma ray data. These
signals of Dark Matter Annihilation are compatible with Supersymmetry for boost
factors of 20 upwards and have a statistical significance of more than
$10\sigma$ in comparison with the conventional galactic model. The latter
combined with all features mentioned above provides an intriguing hint that the
EGRET excess is indeed a signal from Dark Matter Annihilation.

high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters formed in the
concordance LCDM cosmology. In agreement with previous studies, we find that
the radial distribution of subhalos is significantly less concentrated than
that of the dark matter, when subhalos are selected using their present-day
gravitationally bound mass. We show that the difference in the radial
distribution is not a numerical artifact and is due to tidal stripping. The
subhalos in the cluster core lose more than 70% of their initial mass since
accretion, while the average tidal mass loss for halos near the virial radius
is ~30%. This introduces a radial bias in the spatial distribution of subhalos
when they are selected using their tidally truncated mass. We demonstrate that
the radial bias disappears almost entirely if subhalos are selected using their
mass or circular velocity at the accretion epoch. The comparisons of the
results of dissipationless simulations to the observed distribution of galaxies
in clusters are therefore sensitive to the selection criteria used to select
subhalo samples. Using the simulations that include cooling and starformation,
we show that the radial distribution of subhalos is in reasonable agreement
with the observed radial distribution of galaxies in clusters for
0.1<R/R200<2.0, if subhalos are selected using the stellar mass of galaxies.
The radial bias is minimized in this case because the stars are located in the
centers of dark matter subhalos and are tightly bound. The stellar mass of an
object is therefore approximately conserved as the dark matter is stripped from
the outer regions. Nevertheless, the concentration of the radial distribution
of galaxies is systematically lower than that of the dark matter.

five years of {\rm RXTE} observations of the atoll source 4U 1636-53. The data
was divided into 10309 segments of 128 sec each. The histogram of the number of
segments as a function of count rate shows that the system can naturally be
classified into four flux states. For each segment an automated search for kHz
QPO was undertaken and the histograms of the maximum Leahy normalised power
$P_{max}$ for the four flux states were created. These were fitted by
probability distribution functions under the assumption that the intrinsic
amplitude of the QPO has a normal distribution. The best fit distribution
functions, showed that the fraction $f$ of the time the system exhibits a kHz
QPO, decreases from near unity for the lowest flux state ($\approx 1400$ c/s)
to zero for the highest one ($> 2550$ c/s) while the average amplitude remains
nearly constant. Based on the best fit probability distribution functions, a
threshold $P_{thre}$ was defined, such that 95% of the segments with $P_{max} >
P_{thre}$ correspond to a real QPO signal. For segments selected by this
criterion, the frequency versus count rate plot reproduced the earlier known
``parallel track'' variation with the tracks coinciding roughly with the flux
states. It is shown that the gaps between the tracks are not caused by uneven
sampling, but rather the QPO phenomenon is absent or weak when the system's
flux level is intermediate between two flux states.

Control and Monitoring Environment (ACME), a scalable, flexible infrastructure
for monitoring, analyzing, and controlling Internet-scale systems. ACME
consists of two parts. ISING, the Internet Sensor In-Network agGregator,
queries sensors and aggregates the results as they are routed through an
overlay network. ENTRIE, the ENgine for TRiggering Internet Events, uses the
data streams supplied by ISING, in combination with a user's XML configuration
file, to trigger actuators such as killing processes during a robustness
benchmark or paging a system administrator when predefined anomalous conditions
are observed. In this paper we describe the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ACME and its constituent parts. We find that for a 512-node
system running atop an emulated Internet topology, ISING's use of in-network
aggregation can reduce end-to-end query-response latency by more than 50%
compared to using either direct network connections or the same overlay network
without aggregation. We also find that an untuned implementation of ACME can
invoke an actuator on one or all nodes in response to a discrete or aggregate

concrete benchmarking and monitoring scenarios.

this paper, we prove that a closed non-Haken 3-manifold has only finitely many

Waldhausen conjecture. Another immediate corollary is that for any irreducible
non-Haken 3-manifold M, there is a number N, such that any two Heegaard
splittings of M are equivalent after at most N stabilizations.

directions of a linear lossless optical element can be reformulated in terms of
an eigenvalue problem related to the unimodular factor of the transfer matrix
of the optical device. This formulation makes any actual computation of the
characteristic directions amenable to pre-implemented numerical routines,
thereby facilitating the decomposition of the transfer matrix into equivalent
linear retarders and rotators according to the related Poincare equivalence
theorem. The method is expected to be useful whenever the inverse problem of
reconstruction of the internal state of a transparent medium from optical data
obtained by tomographical methods is an issue.

  hydrodynamic effect",,,"10.1016/j.cplett.2005.01.125",,"physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  Rotational friction on proteins and macromolecules is known to derive
contributions from at least two distinct sources -- hydrodynamic (due to
viscosity) and dielectric friction (due to polar interactions). In the existing
theoretical approaches, the effect of the latter is taken into account in an
{\it ad hoc} manner, by increasing the size of the protein with the addition of
a hydration layer. Here we calculate the rotational dielectric friction on a
protein ($\zeta_{DF}$) by using a generalized arbitrary charge distribution
model (where the charges are obtained from quantum chemical calculation) and
the hydrodynamic friction with stick boundary condition,
($\zeta_{hyd}^{stick}$) by using the sophisticated theoretical technique known
as tri-axial ellipsoidal method, formulated by Harding [S. E. Harding, Comp.
Biol. Med. {\bf 12}, 75 (1982)]. The calculation of hydrodynamic friction is
done with only the dry volume of the protein (no hydration layer). We find that
the total friction obtained by summing up $\zeta_{DF}$ and
$\zeta_{hyd}^{stick}$ gives reasonable agreement with the experimental results,
i.e., $\zeta_{exp} \approx \zeta_{DF} + \zeta_{hyd}^{stick}$.
