particles with 2.5 < p_T < 4.0 GeV/c and lower p_T charged hadrons have been
measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The probability of finding a hadron near in
azimuthal angle to the trigger particle is almost identical for leading mesons
and baryons for non-central Au+Au. The yield for both trigger baryons and
mesons is significantly higher in Au+Au than in p+p and d+Au, except for
trigger baryons in central collisions. The baryon excess is likely to arise
predominantly from hard scattering processes.

providing complete, reliable and meaningful observational datasets, and the
conceptual impossibility of testing theories against data imply that the usual
Galilean scientific validation criteria do not apply to climate science. The
different epistemology pertaining to climate science implies that its answers
cannot be singular and deterministic; they must be plural and stated in
probabilistic terms. Therefore, in order to extract meaningful estimates of
future climate change from a model, it is necessary to explore the model'
uncertainties. In terms of societal impacts of scientific knowledge, it is
necessary to accept that any political choice in a matter involving complex
systems is made under unavoidable conditions of uncertainty. Nevertheless,
detailed probabilistic results in science can provide a baseline for a sensible
process of decision making.

uncertainties in confidence interval calculations is based on combining a
frequentist construction of confidence belts with a Bayesian treatment of
systematic uncertainties. In this note we present a study of the coverage of
this method for the standard Likelihood Ratio (aka Feldman & Cousins)
construction for a Poisson process with known background and Gaussian or
log-Normal distributed uncertainties in the background or signal efficiency.
For uncertainties in the signal efficiency of upto 40 % we find over-coverage
on the level of 2 to 4 % depending on the size of uncertainties and the region
in signal space. Uncertainties in the background generally have smaller effect
on the coverage. A considerable smoothing of the coverage curves is observed. A
software package is presented which allows fast calculation of the confidence
intervals for a variety of assumptions on shape and size of systematic
uncertainties for different nuisance parameters. The calculation speed allows
experimenters to test the coverage for their specific conditions.

information between distant sites. In this work we discuss simple protocols to
realize state transfer with high fidelity. The channels do not require
complicate gating but use the natural dynamics of a properly designed array. We
investigate the influence of static disorder both in the Josephson energies and
in the coupling to the background gate charges, as well as the effect of
dynamical noise. We also analyze the readout process, and its backaction on the
state transfer.

probability, according to which probability statements apply only to ensembles.
It is argued that we should, instead, adopt an epistemic, or Bayesian
conception, in which probabilities are conceived as logical constructs rather
than physical realities, and in which probability statements do apply directly
to individual events. The question is closely related to the disagreement
between the orthodox school of statistical thought and the Bayesian school. It
has important technical implications (it makes a difference, what statistical
methodology one adopts). It may also have important implications for the
interpretation of the quantum state.
