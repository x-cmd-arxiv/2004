suggests that quasars behind strong MgII absorbers are in average brightened by
-0.05 to -0.2 magnitude due to magnification. One must therefore revisit the
claim that, in magnitude limited surveys, quasars with strong absorbers tend to
be missed due to extinction effects. In addition to constraining the mass of

European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) data of the Galactic supernova remnant

pulsar (AXP) 1E 2259+586 and has an unusual semi-circular morphology in both
the X-ray and the radio, and an extended X-ray bright interior region known as
the `Lobe'. The deep EPIC mosaic image of the remnant shows no emission towards
the west where a giant molecular cloud complex is located. No morphological
connection between the Lobe and the AXP is found. We find remarkably little
spectral variation across the remnant given the large intensity variations. All
spectra of the shell and the Lobe are well fitted by a single-temperature
non-equilibrium ionization model for a collisional plasma with solar abundances
(kT = 0.5 - 0.7 keV, tau = n_e t = 1 - 4 x 10^11 s cm^-3, N_H = 5 - 7 x 10^21
cm^-2). There is no indication of nonthermal emission in the Lobe or the shell.
We conclude that the Lobe originated from an interaction of the SNR shock wave
with an interstellar cloud. Applying the Sedov solution for the undisturbed
eastern part of the SNR, and assuming full equilibration between the electrons
and ions behind the shock front, the SNR shock velocity is derived as v_s = 720
+/- 60 km s^-1, the remnant age as t = (8.8 +/- 0.9) x 10^3 d_3 yr, the initial
energy as E_0 = (7.4 +/- 2.9) x 10^50 d_3^2.5 ergs, and the pre-shock density
of the nuclei in the ambient medium as n_0 = (0.16 +/- 0.02) d_3^-0.5 cm^-3, at
an assumed distance of D = 3.0 d_3 kpc. Assuming CTB 109 and 1E 2259+586 are
associated, these values constrain the age and the environment of the
progenitor of the SNR and the pulsar.

and evolution of relativistic jets and winds, driven by thermal energy
deposition, possibly due to neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, in the close
vicinity of black hole-accretion torus systems. The latter are considered to be
the remnants of compact object mergers. Our two-dimensional simulations
establish the link between such mergers and future observations of short
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by the SWIFT satellite. They show that
ultrarelativistic outflow with maximum terminal Lorentz factors (Gamma) around
1000 develops for polar energy deposition rates above some 1e48 erg/s per
steradian, provided the merger environment has a sufficiently low baryon
density. Due to the collimation by the dense accretion torus the typical
semi-opening angles of the Gamma > 100 cone are 5-10 degrees, corresponding to
about 0.4-1.5% of the hemisphere and apparent isotropized energies (kinetic
plus internal) up to ~1e51 erg. 10-30% of the deposited energy are transferred
to the outflow with Gamma > 100. Our models confirm the viability of
post-merger BH-torus systems as engines of short, hard GRBs and can explain the
durations of all observed short GRBs, because different propagation velocities
of the front and rear ends lead to a radial stretching of the ultrarelativistic
fireball before transparency is reached. The ultrarelativistic flow reveals a
highly non-uniform structure with Lorentz factor variations up to factors of a
few, caused by the action of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that originate at
the fireball-torus interface (abbreviated).

launching and acceleration of the wind for relatively unfavorable conditions.
In particular, we take into account the central engine radiation as a source of
ionizing photons but neglect its contribution to the radiation force.
Additionally, we account for the attenuation of the X-ray radiation by
computing the X-ray optical depth in the radial direction assuming that only
electron scattering contributes to the opacity. Our new simulations confirm the
main result from our previous work: the disk atmosphere can 'shield' itself
from external X-rays so that the local disk radiation can launch gas off the
disk photosphere. We also find that the local disk force suffices to accelerate
the disk wind to high velocities in the radial direction. This is true provided
the wind does not change significantly the geometry of the disk radiation by
continuum scattering and absorption processes; we discuss plausibility of this
requirement. Synthetic profiles of a typical resonance ultraviolet line
predicted by our models are consistent with observations of broad absorption

we report positive detections of CIII suggesting the gas is predominantly
photoionized, has multiple ionization phases, or is in a non-equilibrium state.
This contrasts with the general description of the warm-hot intergalactic

predominantly in collisional ionization equilibrium. We have also searched the
sightline for the NeVIII doublet (a better probe of WHIM gas with T>10^6K) over

N(HI) = 10^(14-16) cm^-2. Both the slope and normalization of this correlation
match the prediction inferred from the results of Dave and Tripp for the low z

the six photoionized metal-line systems show a total hydrogen column density
within a factor of 2 of 10^18.7 cm^-2. Finally, the median metallicity [M/H] of
twelve z~0.3 absorbers with N(HI)>10^14 cm^-2 is [M/H] ~> -1.5 with large

However, because of photon-photon pair production, only low energy (MeV)
gamma-rays can escape these compact objects with typically very large
compactness parameter, given that in most cases the accretion disks within 10
Schwarzschild radii radiate with a power exceeding 10 percent of the Eddington
luminosity. Therefore, the high-energy gamma-ray emission of these objects
(both stellar mass and supermassive BHs) is generally suppressed, and
consequently the unique information on possible particle acceleration process
near the event horizon of the BH is essentially lost. Fortunately, this is not
the case for the super-massive BH located at the dynamical center of our Galaxy

transparent fo gamma-rays up to very high energies, about 10 TeV. We discuss

spatial correlation function of X-ray selected AGN. This result is based on an
X-ray flux-limited sample of 219 AGN discovered in the contiguous 80.7 deg^2
region of the ROSAT North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Survey. Clustering is detected at
the 4 sigma level at comoving scales in the interval r = 5-60 h^-1 Mpc. Fitting
the data with a power law of slope gamma=1.8, we find a correlation length of
r_0 = 7.4 (+1.8, -1.9) h^-1 Mpc (Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7). The median
redshift of the AGN contributing to the signal is z_xi=0.22. This clustering
amplitude implies that X-ray selected AGN are spatially distributed in a manner
similar to that of optically selected AGN. Furthermore, the ROSAT NEP
determination establishes the local behavior of AGN clustering, a regime which
is poorly sampled in general. Combined with high-redshift measures from optical
studies, the ROSAT NEP results argue that the AGN correlation strength
essentially does not evolve with redshift, at least out to z~2.2. In the local
Universe, X-ray selected AGN appear to be unbiased relative to galaxies and the
inferred X-ray bias parameter is near unity, b_X~1. Hence X-ray selected AGN
closely trace the underlying mass distribution. The ROSAT NEP AGN catalog,
presented here, features complete optical identifications and spectroscopic
redshifts. The median redshift, X-ray flux, and X-ray luminosity are z=0.41,
f_X=1.1*10^-13 cgs, and L_X=9.2*10^43 h_70^-2 cgs (0.5-2.0 keV), respectively.
Unobscured, type 1 AGN are the dominant constituents (90%) of this soft X-ray
selected sample of AGN.

diffuse X-ray emission. Point sources with the 0.5--10 keV luminosity exceeding
$\sim 4 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ were detected. Their summed spectra are
well reproduced by a combination of a disk black-body component and a
black-body component, implying that the emission mainly comes from an assembly
of luminous low-mass X-ray binaries. After excluding these point sources,
spectra were accumulated over a circular region of $6\arcmin$ (1.2 kpc)
centered on the nucleus. In the energy range above 2 keV, these residual
spectra are understood mainly as contributions of unresolved faint sources and
spill-over of photons from the excluded point sources. There is in addition a
hint of a $\sim 6.6$ keV line emission, which can be produced by a hot
(temperature several keV) thin-thermal plasma. Below 2 keV, the spectra involve
three additional softer components expressed by thin-thermal plasma emission
models, of which the temperatures are $\sim 0.6$, $\sim 0.3$, and $\sim 0.1$
keV. Their 0.5--10 keV luminosities within 6$\arcmin$ are measured to be $\sim

$\sim 4 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the order of decreasing temperature.
The archival Chandra data of the central region of M31 yielded consistent
results. By incorporating different annular regions, all the three softer
thermal components were confirmed to be significantly extended. These results
are compared with reports from previous studies. A discussion is presented on
the origin of each thermal emission component.

permits us to probe the hot interstellar gas over angular scale of only

lattices into commensurate Mott insulators with average particle density p/q
(p, q relatively prime integers) per lattice site. For bosons on the square
lattice, we argue that the superfluid has at least q degenerate species of
vortices which transform under a projective representation of the square
lattice space group (a PSG). The formation of a single vortex condensate
produces the Mott insulator, which is required by the PSG to have density wave
order at wavelengths of q/n lattice sites (n integer) along the principle axes;
such a second-order transition is forbidden in the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson
framework. We also discuss the superfluid-insulator transition in the direct
boson representation, and find that an interpretation of the quantum
criticality in terms of deconfined fractionalized bosons is only permitted at
special values of q for which a permutative representation of the PSG exists.
We argue (and demonstrate in detail in a companion paper: L. Balents et al.,
cond-mat/0409470) that our results apply essentially unchanged to electronic
systems with short-range pairing, with the PSG determined by the particle
density of Cooper pairs. We also describe the effect of static impurities in
the superfluid: the impurities locally break the degeneracy between the q
vortex species, and this induces density wave order near each vortex. We
suggest that such a theory offers an appealing rationale for the local density
of states modulations observed by Hoffman et al. (cond-mat/0201348) in STM
studies of the vortex lattice of BSCCO, and allows a unified description of the
nucleation of density wave order in zero and finite magnetic fields. We note

geared toward describing not only the long distance but also the intermediate
lengthscale physics of underdoped cuprates. In particular, we elucidate the
dynamical origin and investigate specific features of the Cooper pair
charge-density-wave (CPCDW), which we argue is the state behind the periodic
charge density modulation discovered in recent STM experiments. We illustrate
how Mott-Hubbard correlations near half-filling suppress superfluid density and
favor an incompressible state which breaks translational symmetry of the atomic
lattice. We show how the formation of the CPCDW in such a strongly quantum
fluctuating superconductor can be understood as an Abrikosov-Hofstadter problem
in a type-II dual superconductor, with the role of the dual magnetic field
played by the electron density. The resulting Abrikosov lattice of dual
vortices translates into the periodic modulation of the Bogoliubov-deGennes gap
function and the electronic density. We compute detailed signatures of various
Abrikosov-Hofstadter dual vortex arrays in the single-particle local tunneling
density of states. A 4x4 checkerboard-type modulation pattern naturally arises
as an energetically favored ground state at and near the x = 1/8 doping and

cell membranes. Free volume fluctuations are a prerequisite for diffusion of
lipids and other macromolecules in lipid bilayers. Permeation of small solutes
across a membrane, as well as diffusion of solutes in the membrane interior are
further examples of phenomena where voids and their properties play a central
role. Cholesterol has been suggested to change the structure and function of
membranes by altering their free volume properties. We study the effect of
cholesterol on the properties of voids in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
bilayers by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We find that an
increasing cholesterol concentration reduces the total amount of free volume in
a bilayer. The effect of cholesterol on individual voids is most prominent in
the region where the steroid ring structures of cholesterol molecules are
located. Here a growing cholesterol content reduces the number of voids,
completely removing voids of the size of a cholesterol molecule. The voids also
become more elongated. The broad orientational distribution of voids observed
in pure DPPC is, with a 30% molar concentration of cholesterol, replaced by a
distribution where orientation along the bilayer normal is favored. Our results
suggest that instead of being uniformly distributed to the whole bilayer, these
effects are localized to the close vicinity of cholesterol molecules.

geographical areas inexpensively. Sensors, however, have significant power
constraint (battery life), making communication very expensive. Another
important issue in the context of sensor-based information systems is that
individual sensor readings are inherently unreliable. In order to address these
two aspects, sensor database systems like TinyDB and Cougar enable in-network
data aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improve reliability. The
existing data aggregation techniques, however, are limited to relatively simple
types of queries such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MIN/MAX. In this paper we propose
a data aggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries that
can be answered using sensor networks. These queries include (approximate)
quantiles, such as the median, the most frequent data values, such as the
consensus value, a histogram of the data distribution, as well as range
queries. In our scheme, each sensor aggregates the data it has received from
other sensors into a fixed (user specified) size message. We provide strict
theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the queries in terms of
the message size. We evaluate the performance of our aggregation scheme by
simulation and demonstrate its accuracy, scalability and low resource
utilization for highly variable input data sets.

science, and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search
method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is
used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data
from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity
performed frequently in a variety of applications.
  Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing
so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity.
Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can
result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in
algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application
that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative
method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time
complexity boundary on algorithmic performance.
  The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by
hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting
algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional
sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time
complexity factor -- even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for
further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting.

microscopic degrees of freedom. This paradigm provides a novel interpretation
of coordinate transformations as deformations of ""spacetime solid"" and allows
one to obtain Einstein's equations as a consistency condition in the long
wavelength limit. The entropy contributed by the microscopic degrees of freedom
reduces to a pure surface contribution when Einstein's equations are satisfied.
The horizons arises as ""defects"" in the ""spacetime solid"" (in the sense of well

below about 1.9 GeV, the rate can be calculated without reference to shape

analytically. The resulting prediction for the $B\to X_s\gamma$ branching ratio

$\Delta=m_b-2E_0$. Logarithms associated with these scales are resummed at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order. While power corrections in
$\Lambda_{QCD}/\Delta$ turn out to be small, the sensitivity to the scale
$\Delta\approx 1.1$ GeV (for $E_0\approx 1.8$ GeV) introduces significant
perturbative uncertainties, which so far have been ignored. The new theoretical
prediction for the $B\to X_s\gamma$ branching ratio with $E_\gamma\ge 1.8$ GeV

  meeting, March 28 - April 3, 2004, Angra dos Reis (Rio de Janeiro), Brasil",,"10.1063/1.1843604",,"hep-ph",,"  Fluid dynamical calculations with QGP showed a softening of the directed flow
while with hadronic matter this effect is absent. On the other hand, we
indicated that a third flow component shows up in the reaction plane as an
enhanced emission, which is orthogonal to the directed flow. This is not
shadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable
rapidities, $y_cm = 1-2$. To study the formation of this effect initial stages
of relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied. An effective string rope
model is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes
into account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the
acceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength
(string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk
about ""string ropes"". The results show that QGP forms a tilted disk, such that
the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in the reaction plane, but
deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse flow directions. The
produced initial state can be used as an initial condition for further
hydrodynamical calculations. Such initial conditions lead to the creation of
third flow component. Recent $v_1$ measurements are promising that this effect
can be used as a diagnostic tool of the QGP. Collective flow is sensitive to
the early stages of system evolution. To study the sensitivity of the flow
signal, we have calculated flow harmonics from a Blast Wave model, a tilted,
ellipsoidally expanding source. We studied recent experimental techniques used
for calculation of the $v_n$ Fourier coefficients and pointed out a few
possible problems connected to these techniques, which may impair the
sensitivity of flow analysis.

different dual sigma models perturbed by the same potential. When the

formulated in terms of the Evans function, a complex analytic function whose
zeros correspond to eigenvalues. These problems may exhibit oscillatory
instabilities where eigenvalues detach from the edges of the continuous
spectrum, so called edge bifurcations. A numerical framework, based on a fast
robust shooting algorithm using exterior algebra is described. The complete
algorithm is robust in the sense that it does not produce spurious unstable
eigenvalues. The algorithm allows to locate exactly where the unstable discrete
eigenvalues detach from the continuous spectrum. Moreover, the algorithm allows
for stable shooting along multi-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds. The
method is illustrated by computing the stability and instability of gap
solitary waves of a coupled mode model.

that it is not a necessary condition, although some known results for qubits
can be recovered. When applied to the Werner-Holevo channel, which is known to
violate multiplicativity when p is large relative to the dimension d, the
