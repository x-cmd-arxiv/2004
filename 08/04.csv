line flux and variations, we find that the persistent emission is optically
thin. During the flare event at phase 1.15 the Balmer decrement dropped
suggesting either a significant increase in temperature or that the flares are
more optically thick than the continuum. The data suggests that there are two
HI emitting regions, the accretion disc and the accretion stream/disc region,
with different Balmer decrements. The orbital modulation of H$\alpha$ with the
continuum suggests that the steeper decrement is most likely associated with
the stream/disc impact region. We construct Doppler images of the H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ emission lines. Apart from showing enhanced blurred emission at the
region where the stream impacts the accretion disc, the maps also show
significant extended structure from the opposite side of the disc. The trailed

similar to the optical wisps. The radio wisps are seen to move systematically
outward with projected speeds of up to 0.3c. Comparing the new radio images to
our earlier ones from 1998 and 2000, we show there are also more slowly moving

speed of order 10,000 km/s. Striation is seen throughout the nebula, suggesting
the presence of wave-like disturbances propagating through the synchrotron

observations. Comparing the radio to the optical images, we find that the radio
wisps are sometimes displaced from the optical ones or have no optical

due to (a) time-dependent thermal and non-thermal radiation fields, (b) photo
and collisional excitation and ionization, and (c) high densities, on the
`quartet' of principal w,x,y,z lines, and dielectronic satellites. The highly
detailed models show precisely how, assuming a temporal-temperature
correlation, the X-ray intensity varies between 6.6 - 6.7 keV and undergoes a
`spectral inversion' in the w and z line intensities, characterizing an
ionization or a recombination dominated plasma. The dielectronic satellite
intensities are the most temperature dependent features, but insensitive to
density variations, and significantly contribute to the K ALPHA complex for T <
6.7 keV leading to asymmetric profiles. The 6.7 keV K ALPHA complex should be a
potential diagnostic of X-ray flares in AGN, afterglows in gamma-ray bursts,
and other non-equilibrium sources with the high-resolution measurements
possible from the upcoming mission Astro-E2. It is also shown that high

central 40 kpc, some of which appear to be associated with the currently active
central radio galaxy. The outer southern lobe of the steep-spectrum radio
source appears to be surrounded by a region of cool gas and is at least
partially surrounded by a bright X-ray rim similar to that seen around radio
sources in the cores of other cooling flow clusters. Spectroscopic fits show
that the overall cluster emission is best fitted by either a two temperature
gas (kT_high=7.47 keV, kT_low=0.11 keV), or a cooling flow model with gas
cooling over the same temperature range. This large range of temperatures (over
a factor of 50) is relatively unique to Abell 2029 and may suggest that this
system is a very young cooling flow where the gas has only recently started
cooling to low temperatures. The cooling flow model gives a mass deposition
rate of Mdot=56 +16/-21 Msun/yr. In general, the cluster emission is elongated
along a position angle of 22 degrees with an ellipticity of 0.26. The
distribution of the X-ray emission in the central region of the cluster is
asymmetric, however, with excess emission to the north-east and south-east
compared to the south-west and north-west, respectively. Fitting and
subtracting a smooth elliptical model from the X-ray data reveals a dipolar
spiral excess extending in a clockwise direction from the cluster core to radii
of ~150 kpc. We estimate a total mass of M_spiral ~6 x 10^12 Msun in the spiral
excess. The most likely origins of the excess are either stripping of gas from
a galaxy group or bare dark matter potential which has fallen into the cluster,
or sloshing motions in the cluster core induced by a past merger.

years. The 0.4-10keV XMM spectrum can be approximated by a power-law with
photon index of 1.7-1.8, though it seems to flatten above 5keV, suggesting a
possible complex model, such as partial covering or disc reflection. A
classification based on an analysis of its optical spectrum places NGC7589 in
the Seyfert region, but close to the Seyfert-LINER border-line on the AGN
diagnostic diagrams. We classify NGC7589 as either Seyfert1.9 or LINERI, in the
light of the detection of a broad H_alpha line, which makes NGC7589 an AGN in
the low-luminosity regime. We interpret the observed variability in terms of
either changes in covering factor of absorbing gas in the AGN, or variability
in the intrinsic X-ray luminosity. Should the latter be the case, the inferred
Eddington accretion rate increased from the radiatively inefficient accretion
dominated regime to a value close to the putative critical value, at which a
transition of the accretion mode is supposed to take place. This possibility
presents a new prospect of studying accretion physics in the central black
holes of external galaxies by direct observing changes of `spectral state', as
is common in stellar black hole binary systems.

energy-distributions (SEDs) from 0.4 to 8.0um shows that the majority of these
objects cannot be satisfactorily explained without a well-evolved stellar
population. We find that most of them can be well fitted by a simple
two-component model, where the primary component represents a massive, old
population that dominates the strong IR emission, while the secondary component
represents a low amplitude, on-going star-formation process that accounts for
the weak optical fluxes. Their estimated photometric redshifts (z_p) range from
1.6 to 2.9, with the median at z_p=2.4. For the simple star formation histories
considered here, their corresponding stellar masses range from 0.1 to 1.6e11
M_sun for a Chabrier Initial Mass Function (IMF). Their median rest-frame
Ks-band absolute magnitude is -22.9 mag in AB system, or 1.5xL*(K) for

such objects may be direct progenitors for at least 14 to 51% of the local
population of early--type galaxies. Due to the small cosmic volume of the HUDF,
however, this simple estimate could be affected by other effects such as cosmic
variance and the strong clustering of massive galaxies. A full analysis of the
entire GOODS area is now underway to assess such effects.

spectroscopic success rate, i.e. the fraction of spectroscopic targets which

biweight estimator to measure cluster velocity dispersions from our
spectroscopic redshift samples. We also make a first assessment of substructure

Some of the redshift distributions are significantly non-Gaussian and we find
evidence for significant substructure in two clusters, one at z~0.79 and the
other at z~0.54. Both have velocity dispersions exceeding 1000 km s-1 but are
clearly not fully virialised; their velocity dispersions may thus be a poor
indicator of their masses. The properties of these first 5 EDisCS clusters span
a wide range in redshift, velocity dispersion, richness and substructure, but
are representative of the sample as a whole. Spectroscopy for the full dataset

that the red NIR colors of DRGs cannot be attributed solely to extinction and
require for many an evolved stellar population with prominent Balmer/4000A

of normal nearby galaxies and the UV colours suggest a wide range in star
formation activity and/or extinction. This contrasts with the much bluer and
more uniform SEDs of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). From evolutionary synthesis
models with constant star formation, solar metallicity, Salpeter IMF, and
Calzetti et al. extinction law, we derive for the HDF-S (MS1054-03 field) DRGs
median ages of 1.7(2.0) Gyr, A_V = 2.7(2.4) mag, stellar masses 0.8(1.6)x10^11

ages, lower A_V's and SFRs, but similar stellar masses within a factor of two.

more massive, and more obscured for any given star formation history.

criteria of low frequency and USS means that we should be sensitive to the

for all of the objects in our sample of 26 and discuss the properties of each.
  There is a pronounced bias in this sample towards fainter magnitudes and thus
higher redshifts when compared to complete unfiltered samples such as 7CRS
(Willott et al. 2002), implying that the steep-spectrum technique is still
viable at 74 MHz. However, there are more bright (K < 17) sources in the 74 MHz
sample than in a similar sample selected at 151 MHz, namely 6C*. This is
principally due to the additional selection criterion of a small angular size
for the radio sources in 6C*, four of the six sources in the 74 MHz USS sample
with K < 17 have angular sizes > 15 arcsec (the angular size cutoff of 6C*).
  We find that the distribution of K-band magnitudes from a sample selected at
74 MHz is statistically indistinguishable from the 6C* sample, when similar
angular size filtering is applied to the 74 MHz sample.

to differential rotation of a current of ``free'' superfluid neutrons at
densities above the ``drip'' threshold in the ionic crust of a neutron star.
Such relative flow is shown to be locally describable by adaption of a
canonical two fluid treatment that emphasizes the role of the momentum
covectors constructed by differentiation of action with respect to the
currents, with allowance for stratification whereby the ionic number current
may be conserved even when the ionic charge number Z is altered by beta
processes. It is demonstrated that the gauge freedom to make different choices
of the chemical basis determining which neutrons are counted as ``free'' does
not affect their ``superfluid'' momentum covector, which must locally have the
form of a gradient (though it does affect the ``normal'' momentum covector
characterising the protons and those neutrons that are considered to be
``confined'' in the nuclei). It is shown how the effect of ``entrainment''
(whereby the momentum directions deviate from those of the currents) is
controlled by the (gauge independent) mobility coefficient K, estimated in
recent microscopical quantum mechanical investigations, which suggest that the
corresponding (gauge dependent) ``effective mass'' m* of the free neutrons can
become very large in some layers. The relation between this treatment of the
crust layers and related work (using different definitions of ``effective
mass'') intended for the deeper core layers is discussed.

the cold central disc of NGC 4478 is younger, richer in metals and less

allows us to evaluate the globular cluster luminosity functions as a function
of galactocentric radius. We find that the luminosity function of the inner 50%

markedly from that of the outer 50%. In particular, the luminosity function of

evidence that, below a critical value of the desorption rate, the driven system

nonproductive one at a critical value of the period of the pressure

meV, well above the resonance energy (33 meV) in the YBa2Cu3O6.5 ortho-II
superconductor using neutron time-of-flight and triple-axis techniques. The
spectrum at high energies differs from the low-energy incommensurate
modulations previously reported where the incommensurate wave vector is largely
independent of energy. Well above the resonance the peak of the spin response
lies at wave vectors that increase with energy. Within error the excitations at
all energies above the resonance are best described by a ring around the (pi,
pi) position. The isotropic wave-vector pattern differs from a recently
reported square pattern in different but related systems. The spin spectral
weight at high-energies is similar to that in the insulator but the
characteristic velocity is ~40% lower. We introduce a method of extracting the
acoustic and optic weights at all energies from time-of-flight data. We find
that the optic spectral weight extends to surprisingly low-energies of ~25 meV,
and infer that the bilayer spin correlations weaken with increase in hole
doping. When the low-energy optic excitations are taken into account we measure
the total integrated weight around (pi, pi), for energies below 120 meV, to
agree with that expected from the insulator. As a qualitative guide, we compare
spin-wave calculations for an ordered and a disordered stripe model and
describe the inadequacy of this and other stripe models for the high-energy
fluctuations.

  3, No. J05, 1-36, 2005.",,,"cs.AI",,"  One proposes a first alternative rule of combination to WAO (Weighted Average
Operator) proposed recently by Josang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe, called
Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule (denoted PCR1). PCR1 and WAO are
particular cases of WO (the Weighted Operator) because the conflicting mass is
redistributed with respect to some weighting factors. In this first PCR rule,
the proportionalization is done for each non-empty set with respect to the
non-zero sum of its corresponding mass matrix - instead of its mass column
average as in WAO, but the results are the same as Ph. Smets has pointed out.
Also, we extend WAO (which herein gives no solution) for the degenerate case
when all column sums of all non-empty sets are zero, and then the conflicting
mass is transferred to the non-empty disjunctive form of all non-empty sets
together; but if this disjunctive form happens to be empty, then one considers
an open world (i.e. the frame of discernment might contain new hypotheses) and
thus all conflicting mass is transferred to the empty set. In addition to WAO,
we propose a general formula for PCR1 (WAO for non-degenerate cases).

equilibration of quark-gluon plasmas in heavy-ion collisions in the theoretical
limit of weak coupling (i.e. asymptotically high energy). It is important to
understand what non-linear physics eventually stops the exponential growth of
unstable modes. It is already known that the initial growth of plasma
instabilities in QCD closely parallels that in QED. However, once the unstable
modes of the gauge-fields grow large enough for non-Abelian interactions
between them to become important, one might guess that the dynamics of QCD
plasma instabilities and QED plasma instabilities become very different. In
this paper, we give suggestive arguments that non-Abelian self-interactions
between the unstable modes are ineffective at stopping instability growth, and
that the growing non-Abelian gauge fields become approximately Abelian after a
certain stage in their growth. This in turn suggests that understanding the
development of QCD plasma instabilities in the non-linear regime may have close
parallels to similar processes in traditional plasma physics. We conjecture
that the physics of collisionless plasma instabilities in SU(2) and SU(3) gauge
theory becomes equivalent, respectively, to (i) traditional plasma physics,
which is U(1) gauge theory, and (ii) plasma physics of U(1)x U(1) gauge theory.

flavor multiplets of hadrons that are degenerate in the chiral limit. Generally
it would be unnatural for there to be degeneracy in the hadron spectrum that is

from diquarks-- that these degeneracies can be naturally protected by the full
chiral symmetry of QCD. The resulting chiral multiplet structure recovers the
ideally-mixed pentaquark mass spectrum of the diquark model, and interestingly,
requires that the axial couplings of the pentaquarks to states outside the

these hadrons exist, they are stable in the chiral limit and therefore have
widths that scale as the fourth power of the kaon mass over the chiral symmetry

resonances is described and applied here to pion photoproduction on the
deuteron, which is the simplest composite nucleon system and serves as a first
test case. Pion photoproduction on nuclei is discussed within a chiral
constituent quark model in which the quark degrees of freedom are explicitly
introduced through an effective chiral Lagrangian for the
quark-pseudoscalar-meson coupling. The advantage of this model is that a
complete set of nucleon resonances can be systematically included with a
limited number of parameters. Also, the systematic description of the nucleon
and its resonances at quark level allows us to self-consistently relate the
nuclear medium's influence on the baryon properties to the intrinsic dynamic
aspects of the baryons. As the simplest composite nucleus, the deuteron
represents the first application of this effective theory for meson
photoproduction on light nuclei. The influence of the medium on the transition
operators for a free nucleon is investigated in the Delta resonance region. No
evidence is found for a change of the Delta properties in the pion
photoproduction reaction on the deuteron since the nuclear medium here involves
just one other nucleon and the low binding energy implies low nuclear density.
However, we show that the reaction mechanism is in principle sensitive to
changes of Delta properties that would be produced by the denser nuclear medium
of heavier nuclei through the modification of the quark model parameters.

This provides a simple and straightforward alternative to using space-time
windows to detect aftershock sequences and obviates the need to distinguish
main shocks from aftershocks. Directed networks of earthquakes are constructed
by placing a link, directed from the past to the future, between pairs of
events that are strongly correlated. Each link has a weight giving the relative
strength of correlation such that the sum over the incoming links to any node
equals unity for aftershocks, or zero if the event had no correlated
predecessors. A correlation threshold is set to drastically reduce the size of
the data set without losing significant information. Events can be aftershocks
of many previous events, and also generate many aftershocks. The probability
distribution for the number of incoming and outgoing links are both scale free,
and the networks are highly clustered. The Omori law holds for aftershock rates
up to a decorrelation time that scales with the magnitude, $m$, of the
initiating shock as $t_{\rm cutoff} \sim 10^{\beta m}$ with $\beta \simeq 3/4$.
Another scaling law relates distances between earthquakes and their aftershocks
to the magnitude of the initiating shock. Our results are inconsistent with the
hypothesis of finite aftershock zones. We also find evidence that seismicity is
dominantly triggered by small earthquakes. Our approach, using concepts from
the modern theory of complex networks, together with a metric to estimate
correlations, opens up new avenues of research, as well as new tools to
understand seismicity.

of them are shown to reproduce the classical game. In some, there are no Nash
quantum pure equilibria. In some others, the payoffs are always equal to each
other. In others still, all equilibria favor Alice or Bob depending on a phase
shift of the initial state of the system. Explicit detailed calculations are
for the first time exhibited.

diffraction experiments is shown to overcome a limit which was formerly thought
to be achievable only with entangled photons.

quantum-like effects of the magnetic vector potential in the classical
macrodomain is spurious. The `one dimensional interference patterns' referred
to in the paper by R. K. Varma et al (Phys. Lett. A 303 (2002) 114-120) are not
due to any quantum-like wave phenomena. The data reported in the paper are not
consistent with the interpretation of interference, or with the topology of the
Aharonov-Bohm effect. The assertion that they are evidence of A-B like effect
in the classical macrodomain is based on inadequate appreciation of basic
physical facts regarding classical motion of electrons in magnetic fields,
interference phenomena, and the A-B effect.

nonlinear coupler) with one of them pumped by an external coherent excitation.
Applying the method of nonlinear quantum scissors we show that the quantum
evolution of the coupler can be closed within a finite set of n-photon Fock
states. Moreover, we show that the system is able to generate Bell-like states
and, as a consequence, the coupler discussed behaves as a two-qubit system. We
also analyze the effects of dissipation on entanglement of formation
parametrized by concurrence.

photonic band gap materials from the physics of photonic band gap formation to
the fabrication and potential applications of photonic crystals. We briefly
describe the analogies between electron and photon localization, present a
simple model of a band structure calculation and describe some of the
techniques used for fabricating photonic crystals. Also some applications in
the field of photonics and optical circuitry are briefly presented. In the
second part, we discuss the consequences for the interaction between an atom
and the light field when the former is embedded in photonic crystals of a
specific type, exhibiting a specific form of a gap in the density of states.
  We first briefly review the standard treatment (Weisskopf-Wigner theory) in
describing the dynamics of spontaneous emission in free space from first
principles, and then proceed by explaining the alterations needed to properly
treat the case of a two-level atom embedded in a photonic band gap material.

through linear optical quantum information processors. The idea is based on
applying the Quantum Zeno effect to the process of photon absorption. By
frequently monitoring the presence of the photon through a QND (quantum
non-demolition) measurement the absorption is suppressed. Quantum information
is encoded in the polarization degrees of freedom and is therefore not affected
by the measurement. Some implementations of the QND measurement are proposed.

there exists (does not exist) a well defined, positive phase space
distribution, the so called Galuber-Sudarshan $P$-representation. We derive a
family of classicality criteria that require that averages of positive
functions calculated using $P$-representation must be positive. For polynomial
functions, these criteria are related to 17-th Hilbert's problem, and have
physical meaning of generalized squeezing conditions; alternatively, they may
be interpreted as {\it non-classicality witnesses}. We show that every generic
non-classical state can be detected by a polynomial that is a sum of squares of
other polynomials (sos). We introduce a very natural hierarchy of states
regarding their degree of quantumness, which we relate to the minimal degree of
a sos polynomial that detects them is introduced. Polynomial non-classicality
witnesses can be directly measured.
