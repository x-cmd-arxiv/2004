continuum observations of one very young high-mass star-forming region
disentangle its cluster-like nature already at the very beginning of the star
formation process. The derived protocluster mass function is consistent with
the stellar IMF. Hence, fragmentation of the initial massive cores may
determine the IMF and the masses of the final stars. This implies that stars of
all masses can form via accretion, and coalescence of protostars appears not to
be necessary.

already quite non-Gaussian on scales below 10 Mpc/h at redshift z=3. The
covariance of the one-dimensional mass power spectrum indicates that Fourier
modes in the cosmic density field are highly correlated and that the variance
of the measured one-dimensional mass power spectrum is much higher than the
expectation for Gaussian random fields. It is found that rare high-density

to the length of lines of sight introduces additional correlations between
different Fourier modes. In practice, one observes quasar spectra instead of
one-dimensional density fields. I show that the nonlinear transform between
density and flux quenches the fluctuations so that the flux power spectrum is
less sensitive to cosmological parameters than the one-dimensional mass power

drive their dynamical evolution. However, the fundamental question of how bars
evolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequency
of bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. We investigate the
frequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from the
GEMS survey, which provides morphologies from HST ACS two-color images, and
highly accurate redshifts from the COMBO-17 survey. We identify spiral galaxies
using the Sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. We
characterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to F606W and F850LP images,
taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. We exclude
highly inclined (i>60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphological
classifications, and apply completeness cuts of M_v <= -19.3 and -20.6. More
than 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a<0.5"" and would be
easily missed in earlier surveys without the small PSF of ACS. The bars that we
can reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e>=0.4) and have a in
the range ~1.2-13 kpc. We find that the optical fraction of such strong bars
remains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 Gyr
(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 Gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drastic
decline at z>0.7. Our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at these
three epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks are
already in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (well
above 2 Gyr). The distributions of structural bar properties in the two slices
are, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for the
possibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

relative uncertainty of the coupling constants, we can constrain the sector

outside of the $\mid$b$\mid = 14.6^\circ$ region. By performing the same

relatively large number of model input parameters. Given considerable
uncertainty in those model parameters, the predicted inspiral rates for double
compact objects relevant to gravitational-wave interferometric detectors have
been shown to be are uncertain by several orders of magnitude. Typically,
inspiral rates are estimated for only a small set of models with a remarkably
poor coverage of the highly multi-dimensional parameter space (primarily
because of limited computer resources). Here, using as an example seven
population-synthesis model parameters, we show that it is possible to derive
fits of double-compact-object inspiral rates dependent simultaneously on all
seven parameters. We find these fits to be accurate to 50% for binary black
holes and to 40% for binary neutron stars. The availability of such fits
implies that (i) depending on the problem of interest, it is not necessary to
complete large numbers of computationally demanding population synthesis
calculations; and (ii) for the first time, the sufficient exploration of the
relevant phase space and the assessment of the uncertainties involved is not
limited by computational resources and becomes feasible. Finally, we have also
produced a histogram of the (a priori likely) binary black hole inpsiral rate,
assuming our population synthesis models are equally likely. This histogram,
effectively an a priori probability distribution for the BH-BH inspiral rate,
suggests that merger rate is conservatively bounded below by

them. These are studied in detail by means of higher resolution and higher S/N
spectra. In this paper we describe a pilot study based on a set of 35 stars,
including 23 from the HK survey, 8 from the HES, and 4 comparison stars. We
discovered two new r-II stars, CS29497-004 ([Eu/Fe] = 1.64 +/- 0.22) and
CS29491-069 ([Eu/Fe] = 1.08 +/- 0.23). A first abundance analysis of
CS29497-004 yields that its abundances of Ba to Dy are on average enhanced by
1.5dex with respect to iron and the Sun and match a scaled solar r-process
pattern well, while Th is underabundant relative to that pattern by 0.3dex,
which we attribute to radioactive decay. That is, CS29497-004 seems not to
belong to the class of r-process enhanced stars displaying an ``actinide
boost'', like CS31082-001 (Hill et al. 2002), or CS30306-132 (Honda et al.
2004b). The abundance pattern agrees well with predictions of the
phenomenological model of Qian & Wasserburg.

stable, self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. The drag force between the disc
gas and the embedded planetesimals generally causes the planetesimals to drift
inwards through the disc at a rate that depends on the particle size. In a
marginally stable, self-gravitating disc, however, the planetesimals are
significantly influenced by the non-axisymmetric spiral structures resulting
from the growth of the gravitational instability. For small particles, that are
strongly coupled to the disc gas, and for large particles, that have
essentially decoupled from the disc gas, the effect is not particularly
significant. Intermediate sized particles, which would generally have the
largest radial drift rates, do, however, become significantly concentrated at
the peaks of the spiral arms. These high density regions may persist for, of
order, an orbital period and may attain densities comparable to that of the
disc gas. Although at the end of the simulation only ~ 25 % of the planetesimal
particles lie in regions of enhanced density, during the course of the
simulation at least 75 % of the planetesimal particles have at some stage been
in a such a region. We find that the concentration of particles in the spiral
arms results in an increased collision rate, an effect that could significantly
accelerate planetesimal growth. The density enhancements may also be sufficient
for the growth of planetesimals through direct gravitational collapse. The
interaction between small planetesimals and self-gravitating spiral structures
may therefore play an important role in the formation of large planetesimals
that will ultimately coagulate to form terrestrial planets or the cores of
gas/ice giant planets.

red supergiants (10 Myr<age<100 Myr), but also an older evolved population of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (100 Myr<age<500 Myr). We derive a distance
to I Zw 18 in the range 12.6 Mpc - 15 Mpc from the brightness of its AGB stars,
with preferred values in the higher range. The red giant branch (RGB) stars are
conspicuous by their absence, although, for a distance of I Zw 18 <15 Mpc, our
imaging data go ~ 1-2 mag below the tip of the RGB. Thus, the most evolved
stars in the galaxy are not older than 500 Myr and I Zw 18 is a bona fide young
galaxy. Several star formation episodes can be inferred from the CMDs of the
main body and the C component. There have been respectively three and two
episodes in these two parts, separated by periods of ~ 100-200 Myr. In the main
body, the younger MS and massive post-MS stars are distributed over a larger
area than the older AGB stars, suggesting that I Zw 18 is still forming from
the inside out. In the C component, different star formation episodes are
spatially distinct, with stellar population ages decreasing from the northwest
to the southeast, also suggesting the ongoing build-up of a young galaxy.

CKM-unitarity triangle from these observables. We propose a theoretically clean
method to determine CKM parameters from the ratio of the $B\to\rho l\nu$ decay

the cancellation of soft hadronic form factors in the large energy limit, which
occurs in a suitable region of phase space. The ratio of the $B\to\rho\gamma$

standard unitarity triangle with reduced hadronic uncertainties. The recent
Babar bound on $B(B^0\to\rho^0\gamma)$ implies $R_t < 0.81 (\xi/1.3)$, with the
limiting uncertainty coming only from the SU(3) breaking form factor ratio
$\xi$. This constraint is already getting competitive with the constraint from
$B_{s}$-$\bar B_{s}$ mixing. Phenomenological implications from

and collaborators on the algebraic structure of the process of renormalization
in quantum field theory. Then the concept of $k$-primitive elements is
introduced -- these are particular linear combinations of products of Feynman
diagrams -- and it is shown, in the context of a toy-model, that they
significantly reduce the computational cost of renormalization.
  As a second example, Sorkin's proposal for a family of generalizations of
quantum mechanics, indexed by an integer $k>2$, is reviewed (classical
mechanics corresponds to $k=1$, while quantum mechanics to $k=2$). It is then
shown that the quantum measures of order $k$ proposed by Sorkin can also be

constant is sufficiently large then the back-reaction effect has the
inclination to increase the black hole evaporation. We also present a simple
method to show that it will always produce a divergent flux of outgoing
radiation along the Cauchy horizon where the curvature is a finite value. This
means that the Hawking radiation will be very large in there and shall modify
the classical spacetime drastically. Therefore the black hole evaporation

continuum QRPA methods are performed for even-even $^{18-24}$O, $^{50-58}$Ca
and $^{80-86}$Ni. A clear signature of the di-neutron correlation is found in
the HFB ground state; two neutrons are correlated at short relative distances
$\lesim 2$ fm with large probability $\sim 50%$. The soft dipole excitation is
influenced strongly by the neutron pairing correlation, and it accompanies a
large transition density for pair motion of neutrons. This behavior originates
from a coherent superposition of two-quasiparticle configurations $[l\times
(l+1)]_{L=1}$ consisting of continuum states with high orbital angular momenta
$l$ reaching an order of $l\sim 10$. It raises a picture that the soft dipole
excitation under the influence of neutron pairing is characterized by motion of
di-neutron in the nuclear exterior against the remaining $A-2$ subsystem.
Sensitivity to the density dependence of effective pair force is discussed.

Fluids",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.soft physics.comp-ph",,"  The dynamics of the interface between two immiscible fluids in a rotating
Hele-Shaw cell are studied experimentally, theoretically and by phase-field
simulations of the H-S equations. As the central, denser fluid is centrifuged,
it forms fingering patterns with long, thin radial filaments ended by a
droplet, alternating with incoming fingers of the outer fluid. Simulations show
the length (width) of the filaments to grow (decay) roughly exponentially, and
the incoming finger tips to asymptotically approach a finite radius for n-fold
symmetric initial conditions; these thus tend to a stationary-shape, which is
calculated. The filament width decays with a time constant which depends only
on the viscosity contrast, whereas its length exhibits a completely universal
growth rate, related to the run away of an isolated droplet, for which we give
an exact solution. The exponential behavior is clear for high, but not low
viscosity contrasts A. Both experiments and simulations show systematic
pinch-off of the droplets at the tips of the filaments for low and not for high
A. A lubrication approximation is derived and successfully accounts for the
filament thinning; it explains why pure exponential thinning is not observed
for low A, and it could clarify the presence or absence of finite-time
pinch-off, since the (morphological) agreement of experiments and simulations
suggests that this phenomenon is contained in the Hele-Shaw equations. For low
A, the experimental time constant appears to be different from that predicted
by standard Hele-Shaw boundary conditions and observed in simulations. An
effective slip condition for the Poiseuille flow of inner liquid across the
cell gap in the case of two liquids gives a possible explanation of this
discrepancy.

allows us to construct a hierarchy of reduced order models including maps and
ordinary differential equations which are able to qualitatively explain prior

equations and provide an explanation for the complexity in dripping. We also
provide a new mechanical analogue for the dripping faucet and a simple
rationale for the transition from dripping to jetting modes in the flow from a

quantum processor, should one ever be built, using the Abrams-Lloyd algorithm.
Given a linear differential operator of order 2S, acting on functions
psi(x_1,x_2,...,x_D) with D arguments, the computational cost required to
estimate a low order eigenvalue to accuracy Theta(1/N^2) is
Theta((2(S+1)(1+1/nu)+D)log N) qubits and O(N^{2(S+1)(1+1/nu)} (D log N)^c)
gate operations, where N is the number of points to which each argument is
discretized, nu and c are implementation dependent constants of O(1). Optimal
classical methods require Theta(N^D) bits and Omega(N^D) gate operations to
perform the same eigenvalue estimation. The Abrams-Lloyd algorithm thereby
leads to exponential reduction in memory and polynomial reduction in gate
operations, provided the domain has sufficiently large dimension D >
2(S+1)(1+1/nu). In the case of Schrodinger's equation, ground state energy
estimation of two or more particles can in principle be performed with fewer
quantum mechanical gates than classical gates.

manipulation of pure dynamical states of the system by means of unitary
transformations. Recently, Vilela Mendes and Mank'o have shown that the
conditions for controllability on the state space become less restrictive if
unitary control operations may be supplemented by projective measurement. The
present work builds on this idea, introducing the additional element of
indirect measurement to achieve a kind of remote control. The target system
that is to be remotely controlled is first entangled with another identical
system, called the control system. The control system is then subjected to
unitary transformations plus projective measurement. As anticipated by
Schrodinger, such control via entanglement is necessarily probabilistic in
nature. On the other hand, under appropriate conditions the remote-control
scenario offers the special advantages of robustness against decoherence and a
greater repertoire of unitary transformations. Simulations carried out for a
two-level system demonstrate that, with optimization of control parameters, a
substantial gain in the population of reachable states can be realized.
