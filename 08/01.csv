distribution situated in the 4000 sq.deg. APM survey area. We use models guided
by the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) n(z) as a probe of the underlying
LSS. We first check the usefulness of this technique by comparing the 2dFGRS
n(z) model prediction with the K-band and B-band number counts extracted from
the 2MASS and 2dFGRS parent catalogues over the 2dFGRS Northern and Southern
declination strips, before turning to a comparison with the APM counts. We find
that the APM counts in both the B and K-bands indicate a deficiency in the
local galaxy distribution of approx. 30% to z=0.1 over the entire APM survey
area. We examine the implied significance of such a large local hole,
considering several possible forms for the real-space correlation function. We
find that such a deficiency in the APM survey area indicates an excess of power
at large scales over what is expected from the correlation function observed in
the 2dFGRS correlation function or predicted from $\Lambda$CDM Hubble Volume
mock catalogues. In order to check further the clustering at large scales in
the 2MASS data, we have calculated the angular power spectrum for 2MASS
galaxies. Although in the linear regime (l<30), LCDM models can give a good fit
to the 2MASS angular power spectrum, over a wider range (l<100) the power
spectrum from Hubble Volume mock catalogues suggests that scale-dependent bias
may be needed for LCDM to fit. However, the modest increase in large-scale
power observed in the 2MASS angular power spectrum is still not enough to
explain the local hole.

of protostellar collapse in the spherical limit and find semi-analytic
(self-similar) solutions, corresponding numerical solutions, and purely
analytic calculations of the mass infall rates (the three approaches are in
good agreement). This study focuses on collapse solutions that exhibit nonzero
inward velocities at large radii, as observed in molecular cloud cores, and
extends previous work in four ways: (1) The initial conditions allow nonzero
initial inward velocity. (2) The starting states can exceed the density of
hydrostatic equilibrium so that the collapse itself can provide the observed
inward motions. (3) We consider different equations of state, especially those
that are softer than isothermal. (4) We consider dynamic equations of state
that are different from the effective equation of state that produces the
initial density distribution. This work determines the infall rates over a wide
range of parameter space, as characterized by four variables: the initial
inward velocity $\vin$, the overdensity $\overdense$ of the initial state, the
index $\Gamma$ of the static equation of state, and the index $\gamma$ of the
dynamic equation of state. For the range of parameter space applicable to
observed cores, the resulting infall rate is about a factor of two larger than
found in previous theoretical studies (those with hydrostatic initial
conditions and $\vin = 0$).

large scale shear flows in granular materials is presented. The parallel plate
geometry allows for shear studies without the effects of curvature found in the
more common Couette experiments. A system of independently movable slats
creates a well with side walls that deform in response to the motions of grains
within the pack. This allows for true parallel plate shear with minimal
interference from the containing geometry. The motions of the side walls also
allow for a direct measurement of the velocity profile across the granular
pack. Results are presented for applying this system to the study of transients
in granular shear and for shear-induced crystallization. Initial shear profiles
are found to vary from packing to packing, ranging from a linear profile across
the entire system to an exponential decay with a width of approximately 6 bead
diameters. As the system is sheared, the velocity profile becomes much sharper,
resembling an exponential decay with a width of roughly 3 bead diameters.
Further shearing produces velocity profiles which can no longer be fit to an
exponential decay, but are better represented as a Gaussian decay or error
function profile. Cyclic shear is found to produce large scale ordering of the
granular pack, which has a profound impact on the shear profile. There exist
periods of time in which there is slipping between layers as well as periods of
time in which the layered particles lock together resulting in very little
relative motion.

equations of two types: the four elliptic initial data (constraint) equations,
followed by the six second order evolution equations. Analytically the
constraint equations remain solved under the action of the evolution, and one
approach is to simply monitor them ({\it unconstrained} evolution). Since
computational solution of differential equations introduces almost inevitable
errors, it is clearly ""more correct"" to introduce a scheme which actively
maintains the constraints by solution ({\it constrained} evolution). This has
shown promise in computational settings, but the analysis of the resulting
mixed elliptic hyperbolic method has not been completely carried out. We
present such an analysis for one method of constrained evolution, applied to a
simple vacuum system, linearized gravitational waves.
  We begin with a study of the hyperbolicity of the unconstrained Einstein
equations. (Because the study of hyperbolicity deals only with the highest
derivative order in the equations, linearization loses no essential details.)
We then give explicit analytical construction of the effect of initial data

this is clearly a toy model with regard to constrained evolution, certain

the transverse phi descends from the emitted gluon, hence similar phenomena

start by computing gravitational backreaction effects on the properties of the
Hawking radiation and explain why a more powerful formalism is needed to encode
them. We then use the map bulk-boundary fields to investigate the nature of
exchange algebras satisfied by operators associated with ingoing and outgoing
matter. We propose and comment on some analogies between the non covariant form
of the S-matrix amplitude and liquid droplet physics to end up with
similarities with string theory amplitudes via an electrostatic analogy. We
finally recall the difficulties that one encounters when trying to incorporate
non linear gravity effects in 't Hooft's S-matrix and observe how the inclusion
of higher order derivatives might help in the black hole microstate counting.
