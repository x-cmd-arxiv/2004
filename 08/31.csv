pulsar 1E 1841-045 has a luminosity L_g ~ 10^{36} ergs/s. This luminosity
exceeds the spindown power by three orders of magnitude and must be fed by an
alternative source of energy such as an ultrastrong magnetic field. A gradual
release of energy in the stellar magnetosphere is expected if it is twisted and
a strong electric current is induced on the closed field lines. We examine two
mechanisms of gamma-ray emission associated with the gradual dissipation of
this current. (1) A thin surface layer of the star is heated by the downward
beam of current-carrying charges, which excite Langmuir turbulence in the
layer. As a result, it can reach a temperature kT ~ 100 keV and emit
bremsstrahlung photons up to this characteristic energy. (2) The magnetosphere
is also a source of soft gamma rays at a distance of ~100 km from the star,
where the electron cyclotron energy is in the keV range. A large electric field
develops in this region in response to the outward drag force felt by the
current-carrying electrons from the flux of keV photons leaving the star. A
seed positron injected in this region undergoes a runaway acceleration and
upscatters keV photons above the threshold for pair creation. The created pairs
emit a synchrotron spectrum consistent with the observed 20-100 keV emission.
This spectrum is predicted to extend to higher energies and reach a peak at ~1
MeV.

maser emission in NGC 3079. The largely north-south distribution of emission,
aligned with a kpc-scale molecular disk, and the segregation of blue- and
red-shifted emission on the sky are suggestive of a nearly edge-on molecular
disk on pc-scales. Positions and line-of-sight velocities of blue- and
red-shifted maser emission are consistent with a central mass of ~2 x 10^6 Msun
enclosed within a radius of ~0.4 pc. The corresponding mean mass density of
10^6.8 Msun pc^-3 is suggestive of a central black hole, which is consistent
with the detection of hard X-ray excess (20-100 keV) and an Fe Kalpha line from
the nucleus. Because the rotation curve traced by the maser emission is flat,
the mass of the pc-scale disk is significant with respect to the central mass.
Since the velocity dispersion of the maser features does not decrease with
radius and constitutes a large fraction of the orbital velocity, the disk is
probably thick and flared. The rotation curve and the physical conditions
necessary to support maser emission imply a Toomre Q-parameter that is << 1.
Thus, the disk is most likely clumpy, and we argue that it is probably forming
stars. Overall, the accretion disk in NGC 3079 stands in contrast to the
compact, thin, warped, differentially rotating disk in the archetypal maser
galaxy NGC 4258 (abridged).

merging, thus depleting intermediate-luminosity galaxies to form a few giant
central galaxies, resulting in the prominent dip seen in our LFs. We suggest
that X-ray dim (or low velocity dispersion) groups are the present sites of
rapid dynamical evolution rather than their X-ray bright counterparts, and may
be the modern precursors of fossil groups. We predict that these groups of low

varied the kinetic power of the jet and the emission-weighted X-Ray temperature
of the ICM. The jets transfer their energy to the ICM mainly by the effects of
their terminal shocks. A high fraction of the injected energy can be deposited
through irreversible processes in the cluster gas, up to 75% in our
simulations. We show how one single, powerful jet can reconcile the predicted
X-Ray properties of small groups, e.g. the Lx-Tx relation, with observations.

knot of emission in the jet that was detected by XMM-Newton but not by Chandra

a point source, Chandra would have easily detected it; we therefore conclude
that this knot of emission is diffuse. In summary, we suggest that the jetlike

true jet, and is not due to a chance alignment of discrete point sources or
point-like regions of emission associated with internal shocks.

making it sensitive to cluster mass related trends. We study the correlations
between the BCG luminosity L_b and the mass or luminosity of the host clusters,
finding that BCGs in more massive clusters are more luminous than their
counterparts in less massive systems, and that the BCGs become less important
in the overall cluster light L200 as cluster mass increases. We argue that BCGs
grow in luminosity mainly by merging with other luminous galaxies as the host
clusters grow hierarchically; the decreasing BCG luminosity fraction L_b/L_200
with cluster mass indicates that the rate of luminosity growth in BCGs is slow
compared to the rate at which clusters acquire galaxy light from the field or
other merging clusters.
  We use the observed cluster luminosity-mass relation and a merger tree model
to estimate that the amount of intracluster light (ICL) increases with cluster
mass; calculations suggest that in 10^{15}Mo clusters more than 50% of total
stellar mass is in ICL. The cluster baryon fraction accounting for the ICL is
in good agreement with the CMB constraints. The inclusion of ICL reduces
thediscrepancy between the observed cluster cold baryon fraction and that found
in hydro simulations. Based on the observed Fe abundance in the ICM, we find
that the predicted ICL together with the observed galaxy light, match the Fe
mass-tolight ratio expected from simple stellar population models with a
Salpeter IMF. The ICL also makes it easier to produce the Fe core excess found

distribution of accelerated electrons, which upon detailed investigation turns
out to originate from an acceleration mechanism that is decidedly different

  Electrons are accelerated by strong filamentation instabilities in the
shocked interpenetrating plasmas and coincide spatially with the power law
distributed current filamentary structures. These structures are an inevitable
consequence of the now well established Weibel-like two-stream instability that
operates in relativistic collisionless shocks.
  The electrons are accelerated and decelerated instantaneously and locally; a
scenery that differs qualitatively from recursive acceleration mechanisms such
as Fermi acceleration.
  The slopes of the electron distribution power laws are in concordance with

generally the origin of non-thermal radiation from shocked inter- and

a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement
with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation
function <N> for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated
by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, and
that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo
mass. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there
is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host
a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite,
with M1 ~ 14 Mmin (SPH) or M1 ~ 18 Mmin (SA). The mean occupation number of
young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M ~ 10 Mmin where halos are too
massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host

accumulate. Applying basic scalings for the surface mass flux of a radiatively
driven stellar wind, we calculate the circumstellar density distribution that

characteristics, and trace a well-defined track in the [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H]
plane, consistent with simple closed-box enrichment models and a protracted
star formation history. The dynamical and chemical coherence of this group
suggests that it consists of stars that once belonged to the dwarf that brought
omegaCen into the Galaxy. The presence of this and other ""tidal relicts"" in the

provides a complete reconstruction of any galaxy image, including higher-order

Many independent shear estimators can then be formed for each object, using
linear combinations of shapelet coefficients. These estimators can be treated
separately, to improve their overall calibration; or combined in more
sophisticated ways, to eliminate various instabilities and a calibration bias.
We apply several methods to simulated astronomical images containing a known

correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, starting from a sample of
200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg^2. We concentrate on the projected correlation
function w(r_p), which is directly related to the real space \xi(r). The
amplitude of w(r_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeply
above the characteristic luminosity L_*. Redder galaxies exhibit a higher
amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation
amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the
luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red
galaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies more
strongly clustered at small scales. We interpret these results using halo
occupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological
parameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits
the w(r_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r_p ~ 1-3
Mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \xi(r). The
implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity
threshold L grows as M_min ~ L at low luminosities and more steeply above L_*.
The mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than L is
M_1 ~ 23 M_min(L). These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at
fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function
extrapolation of the satellite population. HOD models nicely explain the joint
luminosity-color dependence of w(r_p) in terms of the color fractions of
central and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. The inferred HOD
properties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.

rich dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) are the longstanding puzzles to
understand their whole evolutional history. Solving this puzzle, we should
grasp what physical mechanism causes the quiescent phase of star formation
under the very gas rich condition after the first starburst phase. We consider
that this quiescent phase is kept by lack of H2, which can be important coolant
to generate the next generation of stars in the low-metal environment like
dIrrs. Furthermore, in dIrrs, H2 formation through gas-phase reactions may
dominate the one on dust-grain surfaces because their interstellar medium (ISM)
are very plentiful and the typical dust-to-gas ratio of dIrrs (D_dIrrs = 1.31 x
10^-2 D_MW, where D_MW is its value for the local ISM) is on the same order
with a critical value D_cr ~ 10^-2 D_MW. We show that the lack of H2 is mainly
led by H- destruction when gas-phase H2 formation dominates since H- is
important intermediary of gas-phase H2 formation. H- is destroyed by the
radiation from all stars born in the previous starburst phase because H-
destroying infrared photon can penetrate the whole ISM of dIrrs. Considering
the physical process which timescale is the longest as main process in
regulating global star formation, we can show this lack of H2 leads the
quiescent phase of star formation. Hence, we can say that the stellar radiation
which destroys H- and leads low H2 abundance should be properly treated in
studying SFHs of dIrrs.

lenses produced by clusters of galaxies. Our purpose is to test the Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) model at small and highly non-linear scales where it has been
claimed that the CDM model may confront several difficulties. We concentrate
our attention on the statistics of strong gravitational lenses. We use two
complementary statistics, lensed arcs and quasars, to probe the mass
distributions. First, we construct a triaxial lens model, and develop a new
method to include triaxiality of dark halos in the lens statistics. We find
that the effect of triaxiality is significant; it enhances lensing
probabilities by a factors of a few to ten, assuming the degree of triaxiality
predicted in the CDM model. In particular, we argue that both central
concentration and large triaxiality of dark halos are required to reproduce the
observed number of arcs in clusters; thus the result can be interpreted as a
strong evidence for the cold and collisionless dark matter. One of the most
notable advantages of the triaxial modeling is that the triaxial modeling
allows us to predict image multiplicities. We find that the CDM halos predict
significant fraction (more than 20%) of naked cusp lenses. In addition, we
point out the image multiplicities depend strongly on the central concentration
of dark halos. Therefore we propose image multiplicities as a new powerful test
of the CDM model. Finally we searched for large-separation lensed quasars from
the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and succeeded in discovering the
first large-separation lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112. We find that the
discovery of the large-separation quadruple lens SDSS J1004+4112 is quite
consistent with the theoretical predictions based on the CDM model. (Abridged)

stellar luminosity of the five observed sources, which in turn have been used

find that in HH100 IR and IRS2 most of the bolometric luminosity is due to
accretion, while the other three investigated sources, including the Class I
object IRS5a, present a low accretion activity (L_{acc}/L_{bol} < 0.2). We
observe a general correlation between the accretion luminosity, the IR veiling
and the emission line activity of the sources. A correlation between the
accretion activity and the spectral energy distribution slope is recognizable
but with the notable exception of IRS5a. Our analysis therefore shows how the
definition of the evolutionary stage of deeply embedded YSOs by means of IR
colors needs to be more carefully refined.

is, first in the BD scalar field-dominated era when the contribution from this
k-essence overwhelms those from other types of matter, the BD theory predicts
the emergence of a yet-unknown {\it zero acceleration} epoch which is an
intermediate stage acting as a ``crossing bridge'' between the decelerating
matter-dominated era and the accelerating phase. Upon realizing this, next,
closer study of the effects of this k-essence on the evolutionary behavior of
the matter-dominated and the accelerating eras has been performed. The result
of the study indicates that the BD scalar field appears to interpolate {\it
smoothly} between these two late-time stages by speeding up the expansion rate
of the matter-dominated era somewhat while slowing down that of the
accelerating phase to some degree. Thus with the newly found BD scalar
field-dominated era in between these two, the late-time of the universe
evolution appears to be mixed sequence of the three stages.

- a host-galaxy component; 3rd order - the UV-optical continuum slope; 4th

does not exist a compact set (< 10 modes) of eigenspectra (covering 900 to 8000

therefore construct several sets of eigenspectra in different redshift and
luminosity bins. From these eigenspectra we find that quasar spectra can be
classified (by the first two eigenspectra) into a sequence that is defined by a
simple progression in the steepness of the slope of the continuum. We also find
a dependence on redshift and luminosity in the eigencoefficients. The dominant
redshift effect is a result of the evolution of the blended FeII emission
(optical) and the Balmer continuum (the ``small bump''). A luminosity
dependence is also present in the eigencoefficients and is related to the
Baldwin effect. The eigenspectra constructed from the wavelength-selected SDSS

recent spectral energy distributions available to describe the integrated
properties of the stellar cluster. Strong constraints on the geometry based on
high spatial resolution observations at different wavelengths -- near-IR (HST
and Keck), mid-IR (TIMMI2) and radio (VLA) -- allows us to restrain the
ionisation parameters to values logU >= -0.5 dex. This constraint on U lead to
two possible solutions for the age and upper mass cutoff of C2: 1) a young (< 4
Myr) cluster with a ""non-standard"" IMF with a low upper mass cutoff Mup < 50
Msun, and 2) a cluster of ~5-6 Myr with a standard high upper mass cutoff (Mup
\~ 100 Msun). Arguments in favour and against these two scenarios are
presented. The origin of the [OIV] 25.9 micron emission measured by ISO and the
possible presence of an intermediate mass black hole inside C2 are also
addressed.

of the star formation history of galaxies that extends over more than a factor

average, galaxies in the rarified environments of voids exhibit bluer colors,
higher specific star formation rates, lower dust content, and more disk-like
morphology than objects in denser regions. This trend persists in comparisons
of samples in low vs. high-density regions with similar luminosity and

and the temperature of the intergalactic medium might explain this dependence
of galaxy evolution on the large-scale environment.

than the field ELG density at similar redshifts, implying that radio-loud

star-formation rates are consistent with surveys of field galaxies at z ~ 1.
However, the variation in candidate density between fields is large and
indicative of a range of environments, from the field to rich clusters. The ELG
candidates also cluster -- both spatially and in terms of velocity -- about the

zero resistance states (ZRS) when driven with microwave radiation. We study the

of motion to describe the current and density fluctuations. We focus on two
models for the transition into a time-independent steady state. Model-I assumes
rotational invariance, density conservation, and symmetry under shifting the
density globally by a constant. This model is argued to describe physics on
small length scales where the density does not vary appreciably from its mean.
The ordered state that arises in this case breaks rotational invariance and
consists of a uniform current and transverse Hall field. We discuss some
properties of this state, such as stability to fluctuations and the appearance
of a Goldstone mode associated with the continuous symmetry breaking. Using
dynamical renormalization group techniques, we find that with short-range
interactions this model can admit a continuous transition described by
mean-field theory, whereas with long-range interactions the transition is
driven first-order. Model-II, which assumes only rotational invariance and
density conservation and is argued to be appropriate on longer length scales,
is shown to predict a first-order transition with either short- or long-range
interactions. We discuss implications for experiments, including scaling
relations and a possible way to detect the Goldstone mode in the case of a
continuous transition into the ZRS, as well as possible signatures of a
first-order transition in larger samples. We also point out the connection of

suppresses persistent currents by orders of magnitude and also removes its

get enhancement of the currents in certain disordered rings. Quite
interestingly we observe that in some cases, electron correlation produces

which focuses on relationships between the corresponding sets of equilibrium

microcanonical entropy $s$ can be expressed as the Legendre-Fenchel transform
of the canonical free energy. The present paper extends the results of Ellis et
al. significantly by addressing the following motivational question. Given that
the microcanonical ensemble can be nonequivalent with the canonical ensemble,
is it possible to replace the canonical ensemble with a generalized canonical
ensemble that is equivalent with the microcanonical ensemble? The generalized
canonical ensemble that we consider is obtained from the standard canonical
ensemble by adding an exponential factor involving a continuous function $g$ of
the Hamiltonian. As in the paper by Ellis et al., we analyze the equivalence of
the two ensembles at both the level of equilibrium macrostates and the
thermodynamic level. A neat but not quite precise statement of the main result

ensembles are equivalent at the level of equilibrium macrostates if and only if
they are equivalent at the thermodynamic level, which is the case if and only

$\tilde\Delta$, and interaction $\tilde U$, and a simple prescription for their
calculation was given using the numerical renormalization group (NRG). These
three parameters completely specify a renormalized perturbation theory (RPT)

combination of the two techniques, NRG to determine $\tilde\epsilon_d$,
$\tilde\Delta$, and $\tilde U$, and then substituting these in the RPT
expressions gives a very efficient and accurate way of calculating the low
temperature behaviour of the impurity as it avoids the necessity of subtracting
out the conduction electron component. Here we extend this approach to an
Anderson model in a magnetic field, so that $\tilde\epsilon_d$, $\tilde\Delta$,

of the renormalized quasiparticles can then be followed as the magnetic field
strength is increased. Using these running coupling constants in a RPT

arbitrary magnetic field strength.

enter this perturbative treatment on the same footing. In this way, a truly

compact directed percolation. We perform detailed numerical simulations of the
corresponding Fredrickson-Andersen model on the lattice in various dimensions,

error-correcting codes for whom membership of a given word in the code can be

general results on local testability: First, motivated by the recently proposed
notion of {\em robust} probabilistically checkable proofs, we introduce the
notion of {\em robust} local testability of codes. We relate this notion to a
product of codes introduced by Tanner, and show a very simple composition lemma
for this notion. Next, we show that codes built by tensor products can be
tested robustly and somewhat locally, by applying a variant of a test and proof
technique introduced by Raz and Safra in the context of testing low-degree
multivariate polynomials (which are a special case of tensor codes).
  Combining these two results gives us a generic construction of codes of
inverse polynomial rate, that are testable with poly-logarithmically many
queries. We note these locally testable tensor codes can be obtained from {\em
any} linear error correcting code with good distance. Previous results on local
testability, albeit much stronger quantitatively, rely heavily on algebraic
properties of the underlying codes.

the spline space. Following the appearance of Shadrin's proof, it was only very
natural to carry the study of $L_\infty$-boundedness of the orthoprojector over
to L-splines. This is a modest attempt in the direction.
  We consider orthoprojectors on spaces of L-splines generated by certain
second-order linear differential operators with constant coefficients. We
concern ourselves with whether the $L_2$-norms of the resulting orthoprojectors
are bounded independenly of the knot sequence.
  For exponential splines generated by the operator $L=D^2-\alpha^2$ we find
the exact mesh-independent bound, which proves to be the same as in the
corresponding polynomial case of linear splines, that is 3. For exponential
splines generated by the operator $L=(D-\alpha^2)(D+\beta^2)$ we prove
mesh-independent boundedness without finding an explicit bound.
  For trigonometric splines generated by the operator $L=D^2+\alpha^2$ with
standard constraints on the partition diameter we find a mesh-independent
bound. We also consider a model example which shows that the above constraints
are not necessary for mesh-independent boundedness to hold - due to an
interesting ""interference"" phenomenon, the $L_2$-approximant remains bounded
while both its coefficients and the norms of LB-splines tend to infinity.

algebro-geometric techniques. Suppose an algebraic group G acts on a central
simple algebra A of degree n. We are interested in questions of the following
type: (a) Do the G-fixed elements form a central simple subalgebra of A of
degree n? (b) Does A have a G-invariant maximal subfield? (c) Does A have a
splitting field with a G-action, extending the G-action on the center of A?
  Somewhat surprisingly, we find that under mild assumptions on A and the
actions, one can answer these questions by using techniques from birational
invariant theory (i.e., the study of group actions on algebraic varieties, up
to equivariant birational isomorphisms). In fact, group actions on central
simple algebras turn out to be related to some of the central problems in
birational invariant theory, such as the existence of sections, stabilizers in
general position, affine models, etc. In this paper we explain these
connections and explore them to give partial answers to questions (a)-(c).

problem on the surface of the unit sphere to determine an orthogonal family of
strictly bandlimited functions that are optimally concentrated within a closed
region of the sphere, or, alternatively, of strictly spacelimited functions
that are optimally concentrated within the spherical harmonic domain. Such a
basis of simultaneously spatially and spectrally concentrated functions should
be a useful data analysis and representation tool in a variety of geophysical
and planetary applications, as well as in medical imaging, computer science,
cosmology and numerical analysis. The spherical Slepian functions can be found
either by solving an algebraic eigenvalue problem in the spectral domain or by
solving a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain. The associated
eigenvalues are a measure of the spatiospectral concentration. When the
concentration region is an axisymmetric polar cap the spatiospectral projection
operator commutes with a Sturm-Liouville operator; this enables the
eigenfunctions to be computed extremely accurately and efficiently, even when
their area-bandwidth product, or Shannon number, is large. In the asymptotic
limit of a small concentration region and a large spherical harmonic bandwidth
the spherical concentration problem approaches its planar equivalent, which
exhibits self-similarity when the Shannon number is kept invariant.

depend on the density of energy deposited in individual cells and in a
surrounding cone whose symmetry axis connects the interaction vertex with the
highest energy cluster in the shower induced by a hadron. The weighting of the
visible energy and the correction for losses due to noise cuts are applied in
separate steps. In contrast to standard weighting procedures the new algorithm
allows to reconstruct the total energy as well as the spatial energy deposition
on the level of individual calorimeter cells. The linearity and the energy
resolution of the pion signal in the momentum interval 2 GeV/c <= p <= 20 GeV/c
studied in this analysis are considerably improved in comparison to the
standard weighting algorithm as practiced presently by the H1 collaboration.
Moreover the energy spectra reconstructed with the new method follow in a broad
interval a Gaussian distribution and have less pronounced tails.
