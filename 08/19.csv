may exert a profound influence over the process of planet formation. The origin
of such emission is uncertain. Although many or perhaps most recently formed,
low-mass stars emit X-rays as a consequence of solar-like coronal activity, it
has also been suggested that X-ray emission may be a direct result of mass
accretion onto the forming star. Here we report X-ray imaging spectroscopy
observations which reveal a factor ~50 increase in the X-ray flux from a young
star that is presently undergoing a spectacular optical/IR outburst. The
outburst is thought to be due to the sudden onset of a phase of rapid
accretion. The coincidence of a surge in X-ray brightness with the optical/IR
eruption demonstrates that strongly enhanced high-energy emission from young
stars can occur as a consequence of high accretion rates. We suggest that such
accretion- enhanced X-ray emission from erupting young stars may be
short-lived, because intense star-disk magnetospheric interactions are quenched
rapidly by the subsequent accretion flood.

Comparison between broad UV lines in radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ)

indications that the black hole (BH) spin, rather than BH mass or accretion

find a ten-fold decrease in EW CIV with Eddington ratio (decreasing from ~1 to

low-mass virialized (Tvir < 10,000K) clouds of primordial composition. While
atomic cooling allows star formation in larger primordial objects, such
""minihalos"" are generally unable to form stars by themselves. However, the
large population of high-redshift starburst galaxies may have induced
widespread star formation in these objects, via shocks that caused intense
cooling both through nonequilibrium H2 formation and metal-line emission. Using
a simple analytic model, we show that the resulting star clusters naturally
reproduce three key features of the observed population of halo globular
clusters (GCs). First, the 10,000 K maximum virial temperature corresponds to
the ~ 10^6 solar mass upper limit on the stellar mass of GCs. Secondly, the
momentum imparted in such interactions is sufficient to strip the gas from its
associated dark matter halo, explaining why GCs do not reside in dark matter
potential wells. Finally, the mixing of ejected metals into the primordial gas
is able to explain the ~ 0.1 dex homogeneity of stellar metallicities within a
given GC, while at the same time allowing for a large spread in metallicity
between different clusters. To study this possibility in detail, we use a
simple 1D numerical model of turbulence transport to simulate mixing in
cloud-outflow interactions. We find that as the shock shears across the side of
the cloud, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities arise, which cause mixing of enriched
material into > 20% of the cloud. Such estimates ignore the likely presence of
large-scale vortices, however, which would further enhance turbulence
generation. Thus quantitative mixing predictions must await more detailed
numerical studies.

optical region from [OII]3727,3729 to beyond [SII]6717,6731, are presented, and
abundance ratios of N, O, Ne, S, and Ar are computed. The auroral [OIII]4363

direct electron temperature T_e method confirm that the sample is metal-poor
with 7.61 <= 12 + log(O/H) <= 8.32. By using these abundances in conjunction
with other T_e-based measurements from the literature, we demonstrate that HII
galaxies and more quiescent dwarf irregular galaxies follow similar
metallicity-luminosity (L-Z) relationships. The primary difference is a
zero-point shift between the correlations such that HII galaxies are brighter
by an average of 0.8 B magnitudes at a given metallicity. This offset can be
used as evidence to argue that low-luminosity HII galaxies typically undergo
factor of two luminosity enhancements, and starbursts that elevate the
luminosities of their host galaxies by 2 to 3 magnitudes are not as common. We
also demonstrate that the inclusion of interacting galaxies can increase the
scatter in the L-Z relation and may force the observed correlation towards
lower metallicities and/or larger luminosities. This must be taken into account
when attempting to infer metal abundance evolution by comparing local L-Z
relations with ones based on higher redshift samples since the fraction of
interacting galaxies should increase with look-back time.

factor of two between the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations taken 4 months
apart. The coronal abundances and the emission measure distribution have been
derived from three different methods using optically thin collisional
ionization equilibrium models. The abundances show an inverse first ionization
potential (FIP) effect. We further find a high N abundance which we interpret
as a signature of material processed in the CNO cycle. The corona is dominated
by a very high temperature (20-40 MK) plasma, which places YY Men among the
magnetically active stars with the hottest coronae. Lower temperature plasma
also coexists, albeit with much lower emission measure. Line broadening is
reported, which we interpret as Doppler thermal broadening, although rotational
broadening due to X-ray emitting material high above the surface could be
present as well. We use two different formalisms to discuss the shape of the
emission measure distribution. The first one infers the properties of coronal
loops, whereas the second formalism uses flares as a statistical ensemble. We
find that most of the loops in the corona of YY Men have their maximum
temperature equal to or slightly larger than about 30 MK. We also find that
small flares could contribute significantly to the coronal heating in YY Men.
Although there is no evidence of flare variability in the X-ray light curves,
we argue that YY Men's distance and X-ray brightness does not allow us to
detect flares with peak luminosities Lx <= 10^{31} erg/s with current
detectors.

coupling to both protons and neutrons and (ii) incorporating bounds from all
existing experiments. We note the surprising fact that CMDS II places one of
the strongest bounds on the WIMP-neutron cross-section, and show that SD
WIMP-neutron scattering alone is excluded. We also show that SD WIMP-proton
scattering alone is allowed only for WIMP masses in the 5-13 GeV range. For the
general case of coupling to both protons and neutrons, we find that, for WIMP
masses above 13 GeV and below 5 GeV, there is no region of parameter space that
is compatible with DAMA and all other experiments. In the range (5-13) GeV, we
find acceptable regions of parameter space, including ones in which the

universe of high redshift. We quantitatively present the physical information
extractable from the observable correlation function in deep redshift space in
a framework of the linear theory. The correlation function depends on the
underlying power spectrum, velocity distortions, and the Alcock-Paczy\'nski
(AP) effect. The underlying power spectrum is sensitive to the constituents of
matters in the universe, the velocity distortions are sensitive to the galaxy
bias as well as the amount of total matter, and the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect
is sensitive to the dark energy components. Measuring the dark energy by means
of the baryonic feature in the correlation function is one of the most
interesting applications. We show that the ``baryon ridge'' in the correlation
function serves as a statistically circular object in the AP effect. In order
to sufficiently constrain the dark energy components, the redshift range of the
galaxy survey should be as broad as possible. The survey area on the sky should
be smaller at deep redshifts than at shallow redshifts to keep the number
density as dense as possible. We illustrate an optimal survey design that are
useful in cosmology. Assuming future redshift surveys of $z\simlt 3$ which are
within reach of the present-day technology, achievable error bounds on
cosmological parameters are estimated by calculating the Fisher matrix.
According to an illustrated design, the equation of state of dark energy can be
constrained within $\pm 5%$ error assuming that the bias is unknown and
marginalized over. Even when all the other cosmological parameters should be
simultaneously determined, the error bound for the equation of state is up to

basically $z\sim$1000. Apparently, Gamma--Ray Bursts (GRBs) are all but
standard candles. However, their emission is collimated and the
collimation--corrected energy correlates tightly with the frequency at which
most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted, as found by Ghirlanda et al.
(2004). Through this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately
enough to probe the intermediate redshift ($z<10$) Universe. Using the best
known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results that emphasize the cosmological
GRB role. A combined fit with SN Ia yields $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.37\pm0.10$ and
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.87\pm 0.23$. Assuming in addition a flat Universe, the
parameters are constrained to be $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.29\pm0.04$ and
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.71\pm 0.05$. GRBs accomplish the role of ""missing link""
between SN Ia and CMB primary anisotropies. They can provide a new insight on
the cosmic effects of dark energy, complementary to the one supplied by CMB
secondary anisotropies through the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect. The
unexpected Standard Candle cosmological role of GRBs motivates the most
optimistic hopes for what can be obtained when the GRB-dedicated satellite,
Swift, will be launched.

unveils a highly clumpy structure of the remnant. Detailed spatially resolved
spectral analysis for the small-scale features reveals that the interior gas is
generally of normal metal abundance and has approached or basically reached
ionization equilibrium. The hydrogen column density increases from southeast to
northwest. Three mechanisms, radiative rim, thermal conduction, and cloudlet
evaporation, may all play roles in the X-ray appearance of 3C391 as a ""thermal
composite"" remnant, but there are difficulties with each of them in explaining
some physical properties. Comparatively, the cloudlet evaporation model is
favored by the main characteristics such as the highly clumpy structure and the
uniform temperature and density distribution over most of the remnant. The
directly measured postshock temperature also implies a young age, about 4 kyr,
for the remnant. The postshock gas pressure derived from the NE and SW rims,
which harbor maser spots, is consistent with the estimate for the maser
regions. An unresolved X-ray source is observed on the northwest border and its

the spin carriers are composed of two distinct populations: the conduction
electrons of spin up, and the conduction electrons of spin down. In order to
distinguish the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions in spin injection,
we describe the current injection with four channels : the two spin populations
of the conduction bands ($s$ or paramagnetic) and the two spin populations of
the more correlated electrons ($d$ or ferromagnetic). The redistribution of the
conduction electrons at the interface is described by relaxation mechanisms
between the channels. Providing that the $d$ majority-spin band is frozen,
$s-d$ relaxation essentially concerns the minority-spin channels. Accordingly,
even in the abscence of spin-flip scattering (i.e. without standard
spin-accumulation or giant magnetoresistance), the $s-d$ relaxation leads to a
$d$ spin accumulation effect. The coupled diffusion equations for the two
relaxation processes ($s-d$ and spin-flip) are derived. The link with the
ferromagnetic order parameter $\vec{M}$ is performed by assuming that only the
$d$ channel contributes to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The effect of
magnetization reversal induced by spin injection is explained by these
relaxations under the assumption that the spins of the conduction electrons act
as environmental degrees of freedom on the magnetization.

involves a systematic expansion in fluctuations, controlled by the size of the

model to construct a mapping which maps the non-interacting spectrum onto the
interacting spectrum to a very high accuracy. This function is universal in the

single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) can be used as quasi one-dimensional (1D)
electrodes to construct organic field effect transistors (FET) with molecular
scale width (~2 nm) and channel length (1-3 nm). An important feature owing to
the quasi 1D electrode geometry is the favorable gate electrostatics that
allows for efficient switching of ultra-short organic channels. This affords
room temperature conductance modulation by orders of magnitude for organic
transistors that are only several-molecules in length, with switching
characteristics superior to similar devices with lithographically patterned
metal electrodes. With nanotubes, covalent carbon-carbon bonds could be
utilized to form contacts to molecular materials. The unique geometrical,

conductivity spectra for CNCOC is qualitatively the same to those of other

of two distinct classes of subgraphs, and show that, in contrast to the

exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters. The
identified topological framework may have important implications for our
understanding of the origin and function of subgraphs in all complex networks.

distributions, a systematic study of the partial B->Xs+gamma decay rate with a
cut E_gamma<E_0 on photon energy is performed. For values E_0<1.9 GeV the rate
can be calculated without reference to shape functions. The result depends on
three large scales: m_b, \sqrt{m_b Delta}, and Delta=m_b-2E_0. The sensitivity
to the scale Delta=1.1 GeV (for E_0=1.8 GeV) introduces significant
uncertainties, which have been ignored in the past. Our new prediction for the
B->Xs+gamma branching ratio with E_gamma<1.8 GeV is
Br(B->Xs+gamma)=(3.44+-0.53+-0.35)*10^{-4}, where the errors refer to
perturbative and parameter uncertainties, respectively. The implications of
larger theory uncertainties for New Physics searches are explored with the

introducing an eternally inflating background in which the entire collection of
accelerating cosmologies is present as intermediate states. The background is a
classical solution which consists of a bubble of zero cosmological constant
inside de Sitter space, separated by a domain wall. At early and late times the
flat space region becomes infinitely big, so an S-matrix can be defined.
Quantum mechanically, the system can tunnel to an intermediate state which is
pure de Sitter space. We present evidence that a string theory S-matrix makes
sense in this background and contains metastable de Sitter space as an
intermediate state.

a complicated Friedmann equation which simplifies to $H^2 \sim \rho^q$ in the
asymptotic regimes. The Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario corresponds to $q=2$
whereas $q=2/3$ $&$ $q=1$ give rise to high energy Gauss-Bonnet (GB) regime and
the standard GR respectively. Amazingly, while evolving from RS regime to high
energy GB limit, one passes through a GR like region which has important
implications for brane world inflation. For tachyon GB inflation with
potentials $V(\phi) \sim \phi^p$ investigated in this paper, the scalar to
tensor ratio of perturbations $R$ is maximum around the RS region and is
generally suppressed in the high energy regime for the positive values of $p$.
The ratio is very low for $p>0$ at all energy scales relative to GB inflation
with ordinary scalar field. The models based upon tachyon inflation with
polynomial type of potentials with generic positive values of $p$ turn out to
be in the $1 \sigma$ observational contour bound at all energy scales varying
from GR to high energy GB limit. The spectral index $n_S$ improves for the
lower values of $p$ and approaches its scale invariant limit for $p=-2$ in the
high energy GB regime. The ratio $R$ also remains small for large negative
values of $p$, however, difference arises for models close to scale invariance
limit. In this case, the tensor to scale ratio is large in the GB regime
whereas it is suppressed in the intermediate region between RS and GB. Within
the frame work of patch cosmologies governed by $H^2 \sim \rho^q$, the behavior
of ordinary scalar field near cosmological singularity and the nature of
scaling solutions are distinguished for the values of $q < 1$ and $q > 1$.

algebra theory and examples, in ascending level of complexity. Part II turns
around the all-important Faa di Bruno Hopf algebra. Section 7 contains a first,
direct approach to it. Section 8 gives applications of the Faa di Bruno algebra
to quantum field theory and Lagrange reversion. Section 9 rederives the related
Connes-Moscovici algebras. In Part III we turn to the Connes-Kreimer Hopf
algebras of Feynman graphs and, more generally, to incidence bialgebras. In
Section10 we describe the first. Then in Section11 we give a simple derivation
of (the properly combinatorial part of) Zimmermann's cancellation-free method,
in its original diagrammatic form. In Section 12 general incidence algebras are
introduced, and the Faa di Bruno bialgebras are described as incidence
bialgebras. In Section 13, deeper lore on Rota's incidence algebras allows us
to reinterpret Connes-Kreimer algebras in terms of distributive lattices. Next,
the general algebraic-combinatorial proof of the cancellation-free formula for
antipodes is ascertained; this is the heart of the paper. The structure results
for commutative Hopf algebras are found in Sections 14 and 15. An outlook
section very briefly reviews the coalgebraic aspects of quantization and the
Rota-Baxter map in renormalization.

the other hand we generalize the Hirota-Miwa equation to the case where there

integrand of the tachyon field satisfy the generalized Hirota-Miwa equation.
Using the formulation based on this evidence, we suggest that the coordinates

soliton coordinates in integrable systems. We also evaluate these correlation
functions, which have not yet been integrated, to obtain the local information

and projective and the evaluation map $\mu_\cC:\Hom^\cC(P,\cC)\ot_SP\to \cC$ is
an isomorphism (of corings) where $S=\End^\cC(P)$. It was observed that for
such comodules the functors $\Hom_A(P,-)\ot_SP$ and $-\ot_A\cC$ from the
category of right $A$-modules to the category of right $\cC$-comodules are
isomorphic. In this note we call modules $P$ with this property {\em Galois
comodules} without requiring $P_A$ to be finitely generated and projective.
This generalises the old notion with this name but we show that essential
properties and relationships are maintained. These comodules are close to being
generators and have some common properties with tilting (co)modules. Some of
our results also apply to generalised Hopf Galois (coalgebra Galois)
extensions.

we generalize the invariance of the index with respect to the push-forward map

transport network is considered through an integration index describing the
capability of the network to interconnect the different parts of the city. The
time evolution is given by Poisson distributed stochastic jumps affecting the
dynamical variables, with intensities depending on the configuration of the

processes are given in term of a set of potentials evaluated applying fuzzy
logic to a practical method frequently used in Switzerland to evaluate the
attractiveness of a terrain for different land uses and the related rents. The
use of a continuum state space enables one to write a system of differential
equations for the time evolution of the CA and thus to study the system from a
dynamical systems theory perspective. This makes it possible, in particular, to
look systematically for bifurcations and phase transitions in CA based models

density functional theory to obtain the van der Waal coefficients $C_{6}$ and
$C_{8}$ of alkali-metal clusters of various sizes including very large
clusters. Such calculation becomes computationally very demanding in the
orbital-based Kohn-Sham formalism, but quite simple in the hydrodynamic

$C_{6}$ and $C_{8}$ sale as the sixth and the eighth power of the cluster
radius rsepectively, and approach the respective classically predicted values
for the large size clusters.

pairs} of closely spaced pulses (`kicks) from standing waves of light (the
$2\delta$-KP). Recent experimental studies with cold atoms implied an
underlying classical diffusion of type very different from the well-known
paradigm of Hamiltonian chaos, the Standard Map.
  The kicks in each pair are separated by a small time interval $\epsilon \ll
1$, which together with the kick strength $K$, characterizes the transport.
Phase space for the $2\delta$-KP is partitioned into momentum `cells' partially
separated by momentum-trapping regions where diffusion is slow. We present here
an analytical derivation of the classical diffusion for a $2\delta$-KP
including all important correlations which were used to analyze the
experimental data.
  We find a new asymptotic ($t \to \infty$) regime of `hindered' diffusion:
while for the Standard Map the diffusion rate, for $K \gg 1$, $D \sim K^2/2[1-
J_2(K)..]$ oscillates about the uncorrelated, rate $D_0 =K^2/2$, we find
analytically, that the $2\delta$-KP can equal, but never diffuses faster than,
a random walk rate.
  We argue this is due to the destruction of the important classical
`accelerator modes' of the Standard Map.
  We analyze the experimental regime $0.1\lesssim K\epsilon \lesssim 1$, where
quantum localisation lengths $L \sim \hbar^{-0.75}$ are affected by fractal
cell boundaries. We find an approximate asymptotic diffusion rate $D\propto
K^3\epsilon$, in correspondence to a $D\propto K^3$ regime in the Standard Map
associated with 'golden-ratio' cantori.

  dynamical systems","10 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Dynamical systems in nature such as fluid flows, heart beat patterns,
rainfall variability, stock market price fluctuations, etc. exhibit selfsimilar
fractal fluctuations on all scales in space and time. Power spectral analyses
of fractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form indicating long-range
space-time correlations, identified as self-organized criticality. The author
has proposed a general systems theory, which predicts the observed
self-organized criticality as signatures of quantumlike chaos. The model shows
that (1) the fractal fluctuations result from an overall logarithmic spiral
trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for the internal
structure. Conventional power spectral analysis of such a logarithmic spiral
trajectory will show a continuum of eddies with progressive increase in phase.
(2) Power spectral analyses of fractal fluctuations of dynamical systems
exhibit the universal inverse power law form of the statistical normal
distribution. Such a result indicates that the additive amplitudes of eddies,
when squared (namely the variance) represent the probabilities, a
characteristic exhibited by the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as
the electron or photon. Further, long-range space-time correlations or
non-local connections such as that exhibited by macroscale dynamical systems
characterize quantum systems also. Therefore selfsimilar fractal fluctuations
generic to dynamical systems of all scales in nature is a signature of
quantumlike chaos. The model concepts are applied to show that the frequency
distribution of bases A, C, G, T in Human Chromosome Y DNA exhibit long-range
spatial correlations.

larger than several tens of kilo-base pairs (kbp), exhibit a discrete
conformational transition from an elongated coil state to a compact globule
state upon the addition of various kinds of chemical species that usually
induce DNA condensation. In this study, we performed a single-molecule
observation on a large DNA, Lambda ZAP II DNA (ca. 41 kbp), in a solution
containing RNA polymerase and substrates along with spermine, a tetravalent
cation, at different concentrations, by use of fluorescence staining of both
DNA and RNA. We found that transcription, or RNA production, is completely
inhibited in the compact state, but is actively performed in the unfolded coil
state. Such an all-or-none effect on transcriptional activity induced by the
discrete conformational transition of single DNA molecules is discussed in
relation to the mechanism of the regulation of large-scale genetic activity.

corresponding to a random choice within an ensemble of measuring apparatuses.
Such mixing is equivalent to a sort of hidden variable, which produces a noise
of purely classical nature. It is then natural to ask which apparatuses are
""indecomposable"", i. e. do not correspond to any random choice of apparatuses.
This problem is interesting not only for foundations, but also for
applications, since most optimization strategies give optimal apparatuses that
are indecomposable.
  Mathematically the problem is posed describing each measuring apparatus by a
positive operator-valued measure (POVM), which gives the statistics of the
outcomes for any input state. The POVM's form a convex set, and in this
language the indecomposable apparatuses are represented by extremal points--the
analogous of ""pure states"" in the convex set of states. Differently from the
case of states, however, indecomposable POVM's are not necessarily rank-one, e.
g. von Neumann measurements.
  In this paper we give a complete classification of indecomposable apparatuses
(for discrete spectrum), by providing different necessary and sufficient
conditions for extremality of POVM's, along with a simple general algorithm for
the decomposition of a POVM into extremals. As an interesting application,
""informationally complete"" measurements are analyzed in this respect. The
convex set of POVM's is fully characterized by determining its border in terms
of simple algebraic properties of the corresponding POVM's.

algorithm. On the other hand, the N^{1/3} bound is optimal, meaning that we
could probably not solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. We thus
obtain the first good example of a model of computation that appears slightly

for this task, originally introduced in Phys. Rev. A {\bf 69}, 022322 (2004),
that is feasible with present day technology. We introduce security conditions
based on the average bias of the bits and the Shannon entropy of the string.
For each, we prove rigorous security bounds for this protocol in both noiseless

mechanics. Roughly speaking, in the absence of noise, a cheater can only bias
significantly a vanishing fraction of the bits, whereas in the presence of
noise, a cheater can bias a constant fraction, with this fraction depending
quantitatively on the level of noise. We also discuss classical protocols for
the same task, deriving upper bounds on how well a classical protocol can
perform. This enables the determination of how much noise the quantum protocol
can tolerate while still outperforming classical protocols. We raise several
conjectures concerning both quantum and classical possibilities for large n

photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack. Recently, it was shown by Curty and
Lutkenhaus [Phys. Rev. A 69, 042321 (2004)] that the PNS attack is not always
the optimal attack when two photons are present: if errors are present in the
correlations Alice-Bob and if Eve cannot modify Bob's detection efficiency, Eve
gains a larger amount of information using another attack based on a 2->3
cloning machine. In this work, we extend this analysis to all distances
Alice-Bob. We identify a new incoherent 2->3 cloning attack which performs
better than those described before. Using it, we confirm that, in the presence
of errors, Eve's better strategy uses 2->3 cloning attacks instead of the PNS.
However, this improvement is very small for the implementations of the
Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol. Thus, the existence of these new attacks
is conceptually interesting but basically does not change the value of the
security parameters of BB84. The main results are valid both for Poissonian and

one can define the zero-point energy and the free energy of the electromagnetic
waves in it: this can be done, independently of the nature of the boundaries,

finite. The first examples we consider are Casimir's original configuration of
parallel plates, and the experimental situation of a sphere in front of a

zero-point energy and the free energy in terms of an integral kernel acting on
the boundaries; it can be expanded in a convergent series interpreted as a
succession of an even number of scatterings of a wave. The quantum and thermal
fluctuations of vacuum then appear as a purely geometric property. The Casimir
effect thus defined exists only owing to the electromagnetic nature of the

is investigated as the key to effective objectivity, the essential ingredient
of ``classical reality''. This focus on the environment as a communication
channel through which observers learn about physical systems underscores
importance of quantum Darwinism -- selective proliferation of information about
``the fittest states'' chosen by the dynamics of decoherence at the expense of
their superpositions -- as redundancy imposes the existence of preferred
observables. We demonstrate that the only observables that can leave multiple
imprints in the environment are the familiar pointer observables singled out by
environment-induced superselection (einselection) for their predictability.
Many independent observers monitoring the environment will therefore agree on
properties of the system as they can only learn about preferred observables. In
this operational sense, the selective spreading of information leads to
appearance of an objective ``classical reality'' from within quantum substrate.
