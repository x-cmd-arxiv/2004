WR+O colliding wind binary Gamma Velorum. The spectrum is dominated by emission
lines from astrophysically abundant elements: Ne, Mg, Si, S and Fe. From a
combination of broad-band spectral analysis and an analysis of line flux ratios
we infer a wide range of temperatures in the X-ray emitting plasma (~4-40 MK).
As in the previously published analysis, we find the X-ray emission lines are
essentially unshifted, with a mean FWHM of 1240 +/- 30 km/s. Calculations of
line profiles based on hydrodynamical simulations of the wind-wind collision
predict lines that are blueshifted by a few hundred km/s. The lack of any
observed shift in the lines may be evidence of a large shock-cone opening
half-angle (> 85 degrees), and we suggest this may be evidence of sudden
radiative braking. From the R and G ratios measured from He-like
forbidden-intercombination-resonance triplets we find evidence that the Mg XI
emission originates from hotter gas closer to the O star than the Si XIII
emission, which suggests that non-equilibrium ionization may be present.

the distance from the identity at time $cn/2$ has a phase transition at $c=1$.
Here we investigate some consequences of this result for the geometry of $G_n$.
Our first result can be interpreted as a breakdown for the Gromov hyperbolicity
of the graph as seen by the random walk, which occurs at a critical radius
equal to $n/4$. Let $T$ be a triangle formed by the origin and two points
sampled independently from the hitting distribution on the sphere of radius
$an$ for a constant $0<a<1$. Then when $a<1/4$, if the geodesics are suitably
chosen, with high probability $T$ is $\delta$-thin for some $\delta>0$, whereas
it is always O(n)-thick when $a>1/4$. We also show that the hitting
distribution of the sphere of radius $an$ is asymptotically singular with
respect to the uniform distribution. Finally, we prove that the critical
behavior of this Gromov-like hyperbolicity constant persists if the two
endpoints are sampled from the uniform measure on the sphere of radius $an$.
However, in this case, the critical radius is $a=1-\log2$.

can either be broadened or narrowed due to multiple scattering and it shows an
oscillatory behavior as the distance changes. Meanwhile, the peak scattering
amplitude is also be either enhanced or reduced. The previously predicted
strong enhancement, however, is not evident. For plane arrays, the usual
resonant scattering of a single bubble in absence of other bubbles can be
suppressed by multiple scattering when the distance between bubbles is
sufficiently small. As the distance increases, the resonant scattering starts
to appear, and the resonance peak position is alternately shifted towards
higher and lower values. Moreover, it is predicted that wave propagation
through a plane bubble array can be significantly inhibited in a range of
frequencies slightly higher than the natural frequency of a single bubble,
possibly a useful feature for noise screening. The ambiguities in the previous
results are pointed out.

  physics","11 pages, 1 figure, accepted to the American Journal of Physics",,"10.1119/1.1848115",,"physics.ed-ph",,"  We discuss a case study of the influence of epistemology on learning for a
student in an introductory college physics course. An analysis of videotaped
class work, written work, and interviews indicates that many of the student's
difficulties were epistemological in nature. Our primary goal is to show
instructors and curriculum developers that a student's epistemological stance -
her ideas about knowledge and learning - can have a direct, causal influence on
her learning of physics. This influence exists even when research-based
curriculum materials provide implicit epistemological support. For this reason,
curriculum materials and teaching techniques could become more effective by
explicitly attending to students' epistemologies.

  Human B Cells","Submitted to RECOMB 2005 (11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables)",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.GN q-bio.QM",,"  Cellular phenotypes are determined by the dynamical activity of networks of
co-regulated genes. Elucidating such networks is crucial for the understanding
of normal cell physiology as well as for the dissection of complex pathologic
phenotypes. Existing methods for such ""reverse engineering"" of genetic networks
from microarray expression data have been successful only in prokaryotes (E.
coli) and lower eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae) with relatively simple genomes.
Additionally, they have mostly attempted to reconstruct average properties
about the network connectivity without capturing the highly conditional nature
of the interactions. In this paper we extend the ARACNE algorithm, which we
recently introduced and successfully applied to the reconstruction of
whole-genome transcriptional networks from mammalian cells, precisely to link
the existence of specific network structures to the expression or lack thereof
of specific regulator genes. This is accomplished by analyzing thousands of
alternative network topologies generated by constraining the data set on the
presence or absence of putative regulator genes. By considering interactions
that are consistently supported across several such constraints, we identify
many transcriptional interactions that would not have been detectable by the
original method. By selecting genes that produce statistically significant
changes in network topology, we identify novel candidate regulator genes.
Further analysis shows that transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and
other gene families known to effect biochemical interactions, are significantly
overrepresented among the set of candidate regulator genes identified in
silico, indirectly supporting the validity of the approach.

wave equation for the electromagnetic vector potential is solved in the case of
a homogeneous dielectric medium. Some examples are considered showing the

to real-life imperfections. Here, we propose a method that can for the first
time make most of those experiments secure by using essentially the same
hardware. Our method is to use decoy states to detect eavesdropping attacks. As
a consequence, we have the best of both worlds--enjoying unconditional security
guaranteed by the fundamental laws of physics and yet dramatically surpassing
even some of the best experimental performances reported in the literature.
