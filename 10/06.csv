baseline of some 12 Gyr. An inherent difficulty with high-redshift observations
is that the objects are very faint and the best resolution (HST) is only ~0.5
kpc. Such studies thereby combine in a highly synergistic way with the great
detail that can be obtained for nearby galaxies. 3 new developments are
highlighted. First is the derivation of stellar masses for galaxies from SEDs
using HST and now Spitzer data, and dynamical masses from both sub-mm
observations of CO lines and near-IR observations of optical lines like Halpha.
A major step has been taken with evidence that points to the z~2-3 LBGs having
masses that are a few x 10^10 Msolar. Second is the discovery of a population
of evolved red galaxies at z~2-3 which appear to be the progenitors of the more
massive early-type galaxies of today, with dynamical masses around a few x
10^11 Msolar. Third are the remarkable advances that have occurred in
characterizing dropout galaxies to z~6 and beyond, < 1 Gyr from recombination.
The HST ACS has played a key role here, with the dropout technique being
applied to i & z images in several deep ACS fields, yielding large samples of
these objects. This has allowed a detailed determination of their properties
and meaningful comparisons against lower-z samples. The use of cloning
techniques has overcome many of the strong selection biases affecting the study
of these objects. A clear trend of size with redshift has been identified, and
its impact on the luminosity density and SFR estimated. There is a significant
though modest decrease in the SFR from z~2.5 to z~6. The latest data also allow
for the first robust determination of the LF at z~6. Finally, the latest UDF
ACS and NICMOS data has resulted in the detection of some galaxies at z~7-8.

maser profile in the extreme red supergiant IRAS 04553-6825, confirming the
suspicion that its wind speed had been severely underestimated. Despite a much
improved spectrum for IRAS 04407-7000, which was known to exhibit a
single-peaked OH maser, no complementary peak could be detected. The new
detection in IRAS 05003-6712 was also single-peaked, but for two other new
detections, IRAS 04498-6842 and IRAS 05558-7000, wind speeds could be
determined from their double-peaked maser profiles. The complete sample of
known OH/IR stars in the LMC is compared with a sample of OH/IR stars in the
galactic centre. The LMC sources generally show a pronounced asymmetry between
the bright blueshifted maser emission and weaker redshifted emission, which we
attribute to the greater contribution of amplification of radiation coming
directly from the star itself as the LMC sources are both more luminous and
less dusty than their galactic centre counterparts. We confirm that the OH
maser strength is a measure of the dust (rather than gas) mass-loss rate. At a
given luminosity or pulsation period, the wind speed in LMC sources is lower
than in galactic centre sources, and the observed trends confirm simple
radiation-driven wind theory if the dust-to-gas ratio is approximately
proportional to the metallicity.

following conclusions: 1) the spheroid and disc scale sizes are correlated; 2)
bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, bulge effective radii, and bulge n_B values
are all positively correlated; 3) the bivariate space density distribution of
elliptical galaxies in the (luminosity, scale size)-plane is well described by
a Schechter luminosity function in and a log-normal scale-size distribution at
a given luminosity; 4) at the brightest luminosities, the scale size
distribution of elliptical galaxies is similar to those of bright spiral
galaxies; at fainter luminosities the elliptical scale size distribution peaks
at distinctly smaller sizes than the spiral galaxy distribution; and 5) bulge
components of early-type galaxies are typically a factor 1.5 to 2.5 smaller

We suggest that the outburst was powered by an increase in the rate of nuclear

understood in term of two-phase models (Haardt and Maraschi 1991, 1993). Such
models postulate that a hot plasma coexists with relatively colder material in
the inner part of the accretion flow. We present the first simulated broad-band
spectra produced by such a system and accounting simultaneously for energy
balance and Comptonisation in the hot phase, together with reflection,
reprocessing, ionization and thermal balance in the cold phase. This was made
possible by coupling three radiative transfer codes: a non-linear Monte-Carlo
code (NLMC), a photo-ionization code TITAN and a linear Monte-Carlo code NOAR.
The equilibrium comptonisation spectrum appears to be sensitive to the shape of
the reprocessed spectrum that, in turn, depends on the ionization parameter,
but also on the structure of the irradiated cold material. This is illustrated
by a comparison of simulations assuming constant density or a constant pressure
in the cold phase. We also compare our results with simplified models where
reprocessing is approximated by a blackbody spectrum. Our detailed treatment
leads to noticeably different spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
characterised by harder X-ray spectra. Even at low ionization parameters the
commonly used blackbody approximation is poor, leading to X-ray spectra that
are too soft. The effect, however, seems not to be strong enough to reconcile
the slab corona model with the hardest observed spectra, unless the reflector
has a constant density and the ionization parameter is large.

four-ringed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, we report on the
spatial correlation between the blue luminescence and the 3.3 micron emission,
commonly attributed to small, neutral PAH molecules, and on the newly-derived
UV/optical attenuation curve for the central source of the RR, HD 44179. Both
results provide strong additional evidence for the presence of small PAH
molecules with masses of less than 250 a.m.u. in the RR, which supports the
attribution of the blue luminescence to fluorescence by the same molecules. We
contrast the excellent spatial correlation of the two former emissions with the
distinctly different spatial distribution of the extended red emission (ERE)
and of the dust-scattered light within the RR. The UV/optical attenuation curve
of the central star is unlike any interstellar extinction curve and is
interpreted as resulting from circumstellar opacity alone. Major contributions
to this opacity are absorptions in broad bands in the mid-UV, contributing to
the electronic excitation of the luminescing PAH molecules, and a sharp
ionization discontinuity near 7.5 eV in the far-UV, which places a sharp upper
limit on the masses of the PAH molecules that are responsible for this
absorption. The strength of the far-UV absorption leads to an abundance of the
PAH molecules of 10^{-5} relative to hydrogen in the RR. Such small PAHs are
perhaps unique to the environment in the RR, where they are shielded from harsh

equation $\eta=1$ inflation starts. The potential curvature eventually changes
to negative values and inflation ends when $\eta=-1$. No spontaneous symmetry
breaking type mechanism for inflation of the new type to occur is here
required. The model naturally gives a bounded $\it{total}$ number of e-folds
which is typically close to the required number for observable inflation and it
is independent of the initial conditions for the inflaton. The energy scale
introduced is fixed by the amplitude of the anisotropies and is of the order of
the supersymmetry breaking scale. The model can also accommodate an spectral
index bigger or smaller than one without extreme fine tuning. We show that it
is possible to obtain reasonable numbers for cosmological parameters and, as an
example, we reproduce values obtained recently by Tegmark $\it{et. al.}$, from
WMAP and SDSS data alone.

triggered by a tidal interaction. HI absorption covers the velocities of the
redshifted maser emission, suggesting a common origin. In the second source,
IRAS14070+0525, a large fraction of the OH emission is resolved out with the

reformulating the action and discarding a boundary term: we find that actions

is the radiation left over from just 380,000 years after the Big Bang. On very
large scales, the CMB radiation field is smooth and isotropic, but the
existence of structure in the Universe - stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies
- suggests that the field should fluctuate on smaller scales. Recent
observations, from the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer to the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Project, have strikingly confirmed this prediction. CMB
fluctuations provide clues to the Universe's structure and composition shortly
after the Big Bang that are critical for testing cosmological models. For
example, CMB data can be used to determine what portion of the Universe is
composed of ordinary matter versus the mysterious dark matter and dark energy.
To this end, cosmologists usually summarize the fluctuations by the power
spectrum, which gives the variance as a function of angular frequency. The
spectrum's shape, and in particular the location and height of its peaks,
relates directly to the parameters in the cosmological models. Thus, a critical
statistical question is how accurately can these peaks be estimated. We use
recently developed techniques to construct a nonparametric confidence set for
the unknown CMB spectrum. Our estimated spectrum, based on minimal assumptions,
closely matches the model-based estimates used by cosmologists, but we can make
a wide range of additional inferences. We apply these techniques to test
various models and to extract confidence intervals on cosmological parameters
of interest. Our analysis shows that, even without parametric assumptions, the
first peak is resolved accurately with current data but that the second and
third peaks are not.

and they resultantly exhibit an excess power than the standard model prediction
in cosmological theory which best fits the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) data at lower multipoles $l\lesssim$900. We calculate the CMB
temperature anisotropies generated by the power-law magnetic field at the last
scattering surface (LSS) in order to remove the tension between theory and
observation at higher multipoles and also place an upper limit on primordial
magnetic field. In our present calculation we take account of the effect of
ionization ratio exactly without approximation. This effect is very crucial to
precisely estimate the effect of the magnetic field on CMB power spectrum. We
consider both effects of the scalar and vector modes of magnetic field on the
CMB anisotropies, where current data are known to be insensitive to the tensor
mode which we ignore in the present study. In order to constrain the primordial
magnetic field, we evaluate likelihood function of the WMAP data in a wide
range of parameters of the magnetic field strength $|\mathbf{B}|_\lambda$ and
the power-law spectral index $n$, along with six cosmological parameters in
flat Universe models, using the technique of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)

$|\mathbf{B}_\lambda|\lesssim 3.9 $nG at 1 Mpc for any $n_B$ values, which is

than previous methods presented in the literature. 158 distinct X-ray sources
are included in our point-source catalogue in the ACIS-I area. The number
counts show a relative dearth of X-ray sources in this region. For example at a
flux limit of 1E-15 (cgs) around 20 per cent more soft band sources are
detected in the HDF-N and almost 50 per cent more in the ELAIS-N1 field, which
we have analysed by the same method for comparison. We find, however, that
these differences are consistent with Poisson variations at 2 sigma
significance, and therefore there is no evidence for cosmic variance based on
these number counts alone. We determine the average spectra of the objects and
find a marked difference between the soft-band selected sources, which have
Gamma=1.9 typical of unobscured AGN, and the hard-band selected sources, which
have Gamma=1.0. Reassuringly, the sample as a whole has a mean spectrum of
Gamma=1.4\pm 0.1, the same as the X-ray background. Nonetheless, our results
imply that the fraction of sources with significant obscuration is only ~25 per
cent, much less than predicted by standard AGN population synthesis models.
This is confirmed by direct spectral fitting, with only a handful of objects
showing evidence for absorption. After accounting for absorption, all objects
are consistent with mean intrinsic spectrum of Gamma=1.76 \pm 0.08, very
similar to local Seyferts (abridged).

dislocation dipoles or slips. In plastic flow high-density dislocations emerge
at large strains to accumulate and grow into shear bands where the strains are
localized. In addition to the elastic displacement, we also introduce the local
free volume {\it m}. For very small $m$ the defect structures are metastable
and long-lived where the dislocations are pinned by the Peierls potential
barrier. However, if the shear modulus decreases with increasing {\it m},
accumulation of {\it m} around dislocation cores eventually breaks the Peierls
potential leading to slow relaxations in the stress and the free energy
(aging). As another application of our scheme, we also study dislocation
formation in two-phase alloys (coherency loss) under shear strains, where
dislocations glide preferentially in the softer regions and are trapped at the

nonadditivity enhances or reduces the fractionation at isotropic-nematic ($IN$)

phase into two nematic phases of different composition ($N_1$ and $N_2$),
depending on whether the nonadditivity is positive or negative. The interfacial

increasing fractionation at the $IN$ interface, and complete wetting of the

introduced. We argue that these forms can simplify the study of program
properties, mainly consistency. The first normal form, called the {\em kernel}
of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A
kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded
semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets.
The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form
tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is
possible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the
Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed.
The second normal form is called {\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed
of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in
3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to
a cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have
positive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static
analysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of
existence of answer sets. This result can be obtained thanks to a novel
graph-like representation of programs, called Cycle Graph which presented in
the companion article \cite{Cos04b}.

two-fluid model is based on Carter's covariant multi-fluid hydrodynamic

and the protons and electrons on the other, are restricted to uniform rotation
around a common axis, but are allowed to have different rotation rates. We have
performed extensive tests of the numerical code, including quantitative
comparisons to previous approximative results for these models. The results
presented here are the first ``exact'' calculations of such models in the sense
that no approximations (other than that inherent in a discretized numerical
treatment) are used. Using this code we reconfirm the existence of
prolate-oblate shaped configurations. We studied the dependency of the Kepler
rotation limit and of the mass-density relation on the relative rotation rate.
We further demonstrate how one can simulate a (albeit fluid) neutron-star
``crust'' by letting one fluid extend further outwards than the other, which
results in interesting cases where the Kepler limit is actually determined by
the outermost but slower fluid.

both electric and magnetic contributions when coupled to conformal
field--strengths whose gauge potentials is are \frac {D-2}{2}- forms. Denoting
by e^I_\L and m^{I\L} the electric and magnetic couplings, gauge invariance
requires: e^I_\L m^{J\L}\mp e^J_\L m^{I\L}=0, where I,\L= 1... m denote the
species of gauge potentials of degree D/2 and gauge fields of degree D/2-1,
respectively. The minus and plus signs refer to the two different cases D=4n
and D=4n+2 respectively and the given constraints are respectively {\rm
{Sp}}(2m) and {\rm {O}}(m,m) invariant. For the simplest examples, (I,\L=1 for
D=4n and I,\L=1,2 for D=4n+2) both the e,m quantum numbers contribute to the
mass \m=\sqrt {e^2 +m^2} . This phenomenon generalizes to $D$ even dimensions

Lagrangians which derive from flux compactifications in higher dimensions. For
D=4 we give the supersymmetric generalization of such couplings using N=1

  Being unit free, they are not affected by scale changes. Moreover,
self-normalization often eliminates or weakens moment assumptions. In this
paper we present several exponential and moment inequalities, particularly
those related to laws of the iterated logarithm, for self-normalized random
variables including martingales. Tail probability bounds are also derived. For
random variables B_t>0 and A_t, let Y_t(\lambda)=\exp{\lambda A_t-\lambda
^2B_t^2/2}. We develop inequalities for the moments of A_t/B_{t} or sup_{t\geq
0}A_t/{B_t(\log \log B_{t})^{1/2}} and variants thereof, when EY_t(\lambda
)\leq 1 or when Y_t(\lambda) is a supermartingale, for all \lambda belonging to
some interval. Our results are valid for a wide class of random processes
including continuous martingales with A_t=M_t and B_t=\sqrt < M>_t, and sums of
conditionally symmetric variables d_i with A_t=\sum_{i=1}^td_i and
B_t=\sqrt\sum_{i=1}^td_i^2. A sharp maximal inequality for conditionally
symmetric random variables and for continuous local martingales with values in
R^m, m\ge 1, is also established. Another development in this paper is a
bounded law of the iterated logarithm for general adapted sequences that are
centered at certain truncated conditional expectations and self-normalized by
the square root of the sum of squares. The key ingredient in this development
is a new exponential supermartingale involving \sum_{i=1}^td_i and
\sum_{i=1}^td_i^2.

normalized error process u_n(X^n-X), where X is the true solution and X^n is
its Euler approximation with stepsize 1/n, and u_n is an appropriate rate going
to infinity: if the normalized error processes converge, or are at least tight,
we say that the sequence (u_n) is a rate, which, in addition, is sharp when the
limiting process (or processes) is not trivial.
  We suppose that Y has no Gaussian part (otherwise a rate is known to be
u_n=\sqrt n). Then rates are given in terms of the concentration of the Levy
measure of Y around 0 and, further, we prove the convergence of the sequence
u_n(X^n-X) to a nontrivial limit under some further assumptions, which cover
all stable processes and a lot of other Levy processes whose Levy measure
behave like a stable Levy measure near the origin. For example, when Y is a
symmetric stable process with index \alpha \in(0,2), a sharp rate is
u_n=(n/\log n)^{1/\alpha}; when Y is stable but not symmetric, the rate is
again u_n=(n/\log n)^{1/\alpha} when \alpha >1, but it becomes u_n=n/(\log n)^2

the intersection of left kernels of normal states of N. Unfortunately, every
projection P in N will satisfy this criterion by Theorem 3.6.11 of Pedersen
(C*-algebras and their automorphism groups). Hence if N = A"" for a C*-algebra
A, then this definition of an open projection does not define the usual open
projections (cf. Proposition 3.11.9 in Pedersen). Hence the proof of Theorem
3.4, which rests on this, fails.

sequence of Lyapunov functions $V_{p}$, which converges to the Lyapunov

extreme data influence properties of the Studentized sum. The leading-term
approximation is used to give the exact rate of convergence in the central
limit theorem up to order n^{-1/2}, where n denotes sample size. It is proved
that the exact rate uniformly on the whole real line is identical to the exact

several inequalities for tail probabilities of sums M_n=X_1+... +X_n of bounded
independent random variables X_j were proved. These inequalities had a
considerable impact on the development of probability and statistics, and
remained unimproved until 1995 when Talagrand [Inst. Hautes Etudes Sci. Publ.
Math. 81 (1995a) 73-205] inserted certain missing factors in the bounds of two
theorems. By similar factors, a third theorem was refined by Pinelis [Progress
in Probability 43 (1998) 257-314] and refined (and extended) by me. In this
article, I introduce a new type of inequality.
  Namely, I show that P{M_n\geq x}\leq cP{S_n\geq x}, where c is an absolute
constant and S_n=\epsilon_1+... +\epsilon_n is a sum of independent identically
distributed Bernoulli random variables (a random variable is called Bernoulli
if it assumes at most two values). The inequality holds for those x\in R where
the survival function x\mapsto P{S_n\geq x} has a jump down. For the remaining
x the inequality still holds provided that the function between the adjacent
jump points is interpolated linearly or \log-linearly. If it is necessary, to
estimate P{S_n\geq x} special bounds can be used for binomial probabilities.
The results extend to martingales with bounded differences. It is apparent that
Theorem 1.1 of this article is the most important.

\refimportantproposition) in Poisson process approximation is proved by taking
the local approach.
  It is obtained without reference to any particular metric, thereby allowing
wider applicability. A Wasserstein pseudometric is introduced for measuring the
accuracy of point process approximation. The pseudometric provides a
generalization of many metrics used so far, including the total variation
distance for random variables and the Wasserstein metric for processes as in
Barbour and Brown [Stochastic Process. Appl. 43 (1992) 9-31]. Also, through the
pseudometric, approximation for certain point processes on a given carrier
space is carried out by lifting it to one on a larger space, extending an idea
of Arratia, Goldstein and Gordon [Statist. Sci. 5 (1990)
  403-434]. The error bound in the general result is similar in form to that
for Poisson approximation. As it yields the Stein factor 1/\lambda as in
  Poisson approximation, it provides good approximation, particularly in cases
where \lambda is large. The general result is applied to a number of problems
including Poisson process modeling of rare words in a DNA sequence.

results are presented for 605 even-even nuclei of known binding energies, going
from mass A=16 up to the heaviest known. The correlation energies range from
0.5 to 6.0 MeV in magnitude and are rather smooth except for large variations
at magic numbers and in light nuclei. Inclusion of these correlation energies
in the calculated binding energy is found to improve two deficiencies of the
Skyrme mean field theory. The pure mean field theory has an exaggerated shell
effect at neutron magic numbers and addition of the correlation energies reduce
it. The correlations also explain the phenomenon of mutually enhanced magicity,
an interaction between neutron and proton shell effects that is not explicable

formulated, where geometry and physics become indistinguishable, so that the
complete understanding of space properties, together with proper assignments
between geometric and physical entities, will provide all necessary
predictions. The author intends to show that GR and Quantum Mechanics (QM) can
be seen as originating from properties of the null subspace of 5-dimensional
space with signature (-++++), together with its associated geometric algebra
G(4,1). Besides generating GR and QM, the same space generates also
4-dimensional Euclidean space where dynamics can be formulated and is quite
often equivalent to the relativistic counterpart. Euclidean relativistic
dynamics resembles Fermat's principle extended to 4 dimensions and is thus
designated as 4-Dimensional Optics (4DO). In this presentation the author uses
G(4,1) with imposition of the null displacement length condition and derives
the method to transpose between the metrics of GR and 4DO; this transition is
proven viable for stationary metrics. It is hopeless to apply Einstein type
equations in 4DO, for the simple reason that a null Ricci tensor always leads
to a metric diverging to infinity. The author uses geometric arguments to
establish alternative equations which are solved for the case of a stationary
mass and produce a solution equivalent to Schwarzschild's metric in terms of
PPN parameters. As a further development, the author analyses the case of a
monogenic function in G(4,1). The monogenic condition produces an equation that
can be conveniently converted into Dirac's, with the added advantage that it
has built in standard model gauge group symmetry.
