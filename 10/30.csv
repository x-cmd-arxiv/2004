scale-dependent or `running' spectral index in the small-scale linear and
nonlinear matter power spectrum and discuss examples of this effect in minimal
supersymmetric models in which the lightest neutralino is a viable
cold-dark-matter candidate. We find configurations in which the neutralino
relic density is set by coannihilations with a long-lived stau, and the late
decay of staus partially suppresses the linear matter power spectrum. Nonlinear
evolution on small scales then causes the modified linear power spectrum to
evolve to a nonlinear power spectrum similar (but different in detail) to
models parametrized by a constant running $\alpha_{s}=d n_{s}/d{\rm ln} k$ by
redshifts of 2 to 4. Thus, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, which probe the
matter power spectrum at these redshifts, might not discriminate between the
two effects. However, a measurement of the angular power spectrum of primordial
21-cm radiation from redshift $z \approx 30$--$200$ might distinguish between
this charged-decay model and a primordial running spectral index. The direct
production of a long-lived charged particle at future colliders is a dramatic
prediction of this model.

neutral hydrogen gas masses, we estimated star formation rates(SFR) and gas
depletion timescales of 72 star-forming BCGs. The SFRs of the BCGs in our
sample span nearly four orders of magnitude, from approximately 10^-2 to
10^2M_sun/yr, with a median SFR of about 3M_sun/yr. The typical gas depletion
timescale of BCGs is about one billion years.
  We found that subtracting underlying stellar absorption is very important to
calculate both dust extinction and SFR of galaxies. Otherwise, the intrinsic
extinction will be overestimated, the SFRs derived from [OII] and Ha will be
underestimated (if the underlying stellar absorption and the internal
extinction were not corrected from the observed luminosity) or overestimated
(if an overestimated internal extinction were used for extinction correction).
After both the underlying stellar absorption and the dust extinction were
corrected, a remarkably good correlation emerges among Ha, [OII], IR and radio
SFR indicators. Finally, we find a good correlation between the measured SFR
and the absolute blue magnitude, metallicity, interstellar extinction of BCGs.
Our results indicate that faint, low-mass BCGs have lower star formation rates.

that the low metal content of the DLA population can arise naturally as a
combination of gas cross-section selection and metallicity gradients commonly
observed in local disk galaxies. We also study the Tully-Fisher relation of the
DLA-selected galaxies and find little detectable evidence for evolution in the
disk population between z=0 and z~0.5. Additional results of our analysis are
as follows. (1) The DLA galaxies exhibit a range of spectral properties, from
post-starburst, to normal disks, and to starburst systems, supporting the idea
that DLA galaxies are drawn from the typical field population. (2) Large
rotating HI disks of radius 30 h^{-1} kpc and of dynamic mass M_dyn > 10^{11}
h^{-1} M_sun appear to be common at intermediate redshifts. (3) Using an
ensemble of six galaxy-DLA pairs, we derive an abundance profile that is
characterized by a radial gradient of -0.041 +/- 0.012 dex per kiloparsec (or
equivalently a scale length of 10.6 h^{-1} kpc) from galactic center to 30

best-fit radial gradient, we further derive an N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity

the vortex follows a spiral orbit which we calculate. When a rotating in-plane
magnetic field is included, the vortex tends to a stable limit cycle which
exists in a significant range of field amplitude B and frequency $\omega$ for a
given system size L. For a fixed $\omega$, the radius R of the orbital motion
is proportional to L while the orbital frequency $\Omega$ varies as 1/L and is
significantly smaller than $\omega$. Since the limit cycle is caused by the
interplay between the magnetization and the vortex motion, the internal mode is
essential in the collective variable theory which then gives the correct
estimate and dependency for the orbit radius $R\sim B L/\omega$. Using this
simple theory we indicate how an ac magnetic field can be used to control

directly observable through the variation of the heat capacity with the angle
between a magnetic field and the location of the zeroes of the gap. The heat
capacity of candidate non-magnetic unconventional superconductors Lu(Y)Ni2B2C
were found to exhibit fourfold oscillations with field angle, the first such
observation. The observed angular variations are in quantitative agreement with
theory, confirming that quasiparticles are created via Doppler shifts at nodes
along <100>. Anomalous disorder effects have been also observed in the
field-angle dependent heat capacity C_{p}(\alpha). In a slightly disordered
sample, anomalous secondary minima along <110> appeared for \mu_{0}H > 1 T,
leading to an eightfold pattern. The coexistence of an anisotropic
superconducting gap and nonlocal effects is shown to drive the anomalous
behavior. These results demonstrate that field-angle-dependent heat capacity
can be a powerful tool in probing the momentum-space gap structure in
unconventional superconductors such as high T_{c} cuprates, heavy fermions,

relativistic vacuum spacetimes, which today cannot yet be evolved numerically
in a satisfactory manner. Specifically, I look at gauge conditions, classifying
them into gauge evolution conditions and gauge fixing conditions. In this
terminology, a gauge fixing condition is a condition that removes all gauge
degrees of freedom from a system, whereas a gauge evolution condition
determines only the time evolution of the gauge condition, while the gauge
condition itself remains unspecified. I find that most of today's gauge
conditions are only gauge evolution conditions.
  I present a system of evolution equations containing a gauge fixing
condition, and describe an efficient numerical implementation using constrained
evolution. I examine the numerical behaviour of this system for several test
problems, such as linear gravitational waves or nonlinear gauge waves. I find
that the system is robustly stable and second-order convergent. I then apply it
to more realistic configurations, such as Brill waves or single black holes,
where the system is also stable and accurate.

CNO solar neutrinos in organic liquid scintillator detectors. Among such
sources, the cosmogenic 11C nuclide plays a central role. 11C is produced
underground in reactions induced by the residual cosmic muon flux. Experimental
data available for the effective cross section for 11C by muons indicate that
11C will be the dominant source of background for the observation of pep and
CNO neutrinos. 11C decays are expected to total a rate 2.5 (20) times higher
than the combined rate of pep and CNO neutrinos in Borexino (KamLAND) in the
energy window preferred for the pep measurement, between 0.8 and 1.3 MeV.
  This study examines the production mechanism of 11C by muon-induced showers
in organic liquid scintillators with a novel approach: for the first time, we
perform a detailed ab initio calculation of the production of a cosmogenic
nuclide, 11C, taking into consideration all relevant production channels.
Results of the calculation are compared with the effective cross sections
measured by target experiments in muon beams.
  This paper also discusses a technique for reduction of background from 11C in
organic liquid scintillator detectors, which allows to identify on a one-by-one
basis and remove from the data set a large fraction of 11C decays. The
background reduction technique hinges on an idea proposed by Martin Deutsch,
who suggested that a neutron must be ejected in every interaction producing a
11C nuclide from 12C. 11C events are tagged by a three-fold coincidence with
the parent muon track and the subsequent neutron capture on protons.

that describe one or more black holes. In this thesis we study exact solutions
in three, four and higher dimensional spacetimes. The study in 3-dimensions is
important due to the simplification of the problem, while the discussion in
higher dimensions is essential due to the fact that many theories indicate that
extra dimensions exist in our universe. In this thesis, in any of the

demanding their ``horizon areas'' to be the sum and difference of that of the
outer and inner horizons of their prototype. The thermodynamics present here is
a ``conformal version'' of black hole thermodynamics, since it is closely
related to the near-horizon conformal symmetry of black holes. The concept of

compatible with this ``conformal thermodynamics'', rather than the usual

satellite measurements of the solar irradiance and the temperature of the lower

two newly recognized dynamic and non-radiative flux factors which must be
applied to the observed sensitivity. The sensitivity is about twice that
expected from a no-feedback Stefan-Boltzmann radiation balance model, which
implies positive feedback. The sensitivity to volcano forcing is also
determined. Preliminary results indicate that negative feedback is present in
this case. Response times of fractions of a year are found for both solar and

  Simulations of an a-Helical Peptide with an Explicit Lipid Bilayer","30 pages, 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  We implement the replica exchange molecular dynamics algorithm to study the
interactions of a model peptide (WALP-16) with an explicitly represented DPPC
membrane bilayer. We observe the spontaneous, unbiased insertion of WALP-16
into the DPPC bilayer and its folding into an a-helix with a trans-bilayer
orientation. We observe that the insertion of the peptide into the DPPC bilayer
precedes secondary structure formation. Although the peptide has some
propensity to form a partially helical structure in the interfacial region of
the DPPC/water system, this state is not a productive intermediate but rather
an off-pathway trap for WALP-16 insertion. Equilibrium simulations show that
the observed insertion/folding pathway mirrors the potential of mean force
(PMF). Calculation of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to this PMF show
that the surface bound conformation of WALP-16 is significantly lower in energy
than other conformations, and that the insertion of WALP-16 into the bilayer
without regular secondary structure is enthalpically unfavorable by 5-10
kcal/mol/residue. The observed insertion/folding pathway disagrees with the
dominant conceptual model, which is that a surface bound helix is an obligatory
intermediate for the insertion of a-helical peptides into lipid bilayers. In
our simulations, the observed insertion/folding pathway is favored because of a
large (> 100 kcal/mol) increase in system entropy that occurs when the
unstructured WALP-16 peptide enters the lipid bilayer interior. The
insertion/folding pathway that is lowest in free energy depends sensitively on
the near cancellation of large enthalpic and entropic terms. This suggests that
intrinsic membrane peptides may have a diversity of insertion/folding behaviors
depending on the exact system of peptide and lipid under consideration.
