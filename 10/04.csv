objects, when applied to system containing disk-accreting white dwarfs
naturally explain the otherwise astonishing absence of jets in cataclysmic
variable stars. Thermal launching is possible when the accreted material is
strongly shocked due to large gradients of physical quantities in the boundary
layer (or at the inner boundary of a truncated disk) and then cools on a time
scale longer than its ejection time from the disk. In our framework the
magnetic fields are weak, and serve only to recollimate the outflow at large
distances from the source, or to initiate the shock, but not as a jet-driving
agent. Using criteria for shock formation and mass ejection, we find the mass
accretion rate above which jets can be launched from boundary layers around
accreting white dwarfs to be ~10^{-6} Mo/y, which explains the absence of jets
in cataclysmic variable stars and their presence in other white-dwarf accreting
systems such as super-soft X-ray sources, symbiotic stars and classical novae.

reaching as high as 17% in two objects. Broad lines were detected in the
polarized spectra of five objects. These observations prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the objects in our sample are indeed type II quasars, in that they
harbor luminous UV-excess AGNs in their centers and that the direct view to the
AGN is highly obscured. For three of the objects in this paper, we have
obtained HST images in three bands. The HST observations, combined with the
spectropolarimetry data, imply that scattering off material outside the
obscuration plane is the dominant polarization mechanism. In all three objects
the sizes of scattering regions are a few kpc. For one object, the extent of
the scattering region, coupled with the characteristics of the polarized
spectrum, argue strongly that dust scattering rather than electron scattering
dominates the polarized light. Our observations are well-described by the basic
orientation-based unification model of toroidal obscuration and off-plane
scattering, implying that the model can be extended to include at least some
high-luminosity AGNs.

expansion of the Universe can be obtained as the effect of a scaling law on
newtonian cosmology with a certain time dependent gravitational constant ($G$).
In the present work we show that it may be problematic to explain the present
accelerated expansion of the Universe using the approach presented in
\cite{iovane}. As a better alternative we apply the same scaling law and a
time-dependent gravitational constant, that follows from the observational
constraints, to relativistic cosmology, i.e. the Friedmann's model. We are able
to show that for a matter-dominated flat Universe, with the scaling law and a
varying $G$, an accelerated expansion emerges in such a way that the function
luminosity distance vs redshift can be made close to the corresponding function
that comes from the usual Friedmann's model supplemented with a cosmological
constant of value $\Omega_{\Lambda}\simeq0.7$. Then the measurements of high
redshift supernovae, could be interpreted as a consequence of the fractal-self
similarity of the $G$ varying relativistic universe.

a uniform and horizontal coronal magnetic field mimicking a pre-existing

of the upcoming and coronal fields are studied. Upon contact, a concentrated
current sheet with the shape of an arch or bridge is formed at the interface
which marks the positions of maximum jump in the field vector between the two
systems. Relative angles above 90 degrees yield abundant magnetic reconnection
and plasma heating. The reconnection is seen to be intrisincally
three-dimensional in nature, except at singular positions along the current
sheet. It drives collimated high-speed and high-temperature outflows only a
short distance from the reconnection site that propagate along the ambient
magnetic field lines as jets. Due to the low plasma density in the corona,
these jets may propagate over large distances and, therefore help distribute
high-density and high-temperature plasma along these newly reconnected field
lines. The experiments permit to discern and visualize the three-dimensional
shape and relative position of the upcoming plasma hill, high-speed jets and
subphotospheric flux system. As a result of the reconnection, magnetic field
lines from the magnetized plasma below the surface end up as coronal field
lines, thus causing a profound change in the connectivity of the magnetic
regions in the corona. The experiments presented here thus yield a number of
features repeatedly observed with the TRACE satellite and the YOHKOH-SXT

pre-existing active regions, local heating and high-velocity outflows.

bidimensionnal simulations of turbulent converging flows which induce the
dynamical condensation of the warm neutral phase into the cold phase. We then
analyse the cold structures and the fraction of unstable gas in each
simulation, paying particular attention to the influence of the degree of
turbulence. When the flow is very turbulent a large fraction of the gas remains
in the thermally unstable domain. This unstable gas forms a filamentary
network. We show that the fraction of thermally unstable gas is strongly
correlated with the level of turbulence of the flow. We then develop a
semi-analytical model to explain the origin of this unstable gas. This simple
model is able to reproduce quantitatively the fraction of unstable gas observed
in the simulations and its correlation with turbulence. Finally, we stress the
fact that even when the flow is very turbulent and in spite of the fact that a
large fraction of the gas is maintained dynamically in the thermally unstable
domain, the classical picture of a 2-phase medium with stiff thermal fronts and
local pressure equilibrium turns out to be still relevant in the vicinity of
the cold structures.

measurements for nearby galaxies based on the magnitude of the tip of red giant
branch stars. Current CCD surveys with HST and large ground- based telescopes
bring $\sim$10%-accurate distances for roughly a hundred galaxies within 5 Mpc.
The new data on distances to galaxies situated in (and around) the nearest
groups: the Local Group, M81 group, CenA/M83 group, IC342/Maffei group,
Sculptor filament, and Canes Venatici cloud allowed us to determine their total
mass from the radius of the zero- velocity surface, $R_0$, which separates a
group as bound against the homogeneous cosmic expansion. The values of $R_0$
for the virialized groups turn out to be close each other, in the range of 0.9
-- 1.3 Mpc. As a result, the total masses of the groups are close to each
other, too, yielding total mass-to-blue luminosity ratios of 10 -- 40
$M_{\sun}/L_{\sun}$. The new total mass estimates are 3 -- 5 times lower than
old virial mass estimates of these groups. Because about half of galaxies in
the Local Volume belong to such loose groups, the revision of the amount of
dark matter (DM) leads to a low local density of matter, $\Omega_m \simeq
0.04$, which is comparable with the global baryonic fraction $\Omega_b$, but
much lower than the global density of matter, $\Omega_m = 0.27$.
  To remove the discrepancy between the global and local quantities of
$\Omega_m$, we assume the existence of two different DM components: 1) compact
dark halos around individual galaxies and 2) a non-baryonic dark matter
``ocean'' with $\Omega_{dm1} \simeq 0.07$ and $\Omega_{dm2} \simeq 0.20$,

a large variation at a given T_ eff and this result may imply that the
thickness of the dust cloud is changing at a given T_ eff. Our Unified Cloudy
Model (UCM), in which the dust cloud forms between the condensation
temperature, T_cond, and the critical temperature, T_cr, is already prepared
for such a new situation and can be used by simply changing T_cr at a given
T_eff, instead of assuming a constant value of T_cr=1800K throughout as in our
previous applications of the UCMs. However, the effects of T_eff and T_cr on
individual spectra are difficult to discriminate, since the effect of T_eff at
a fixed T_cr on one hand and the effect of T_cr at a fixed T_eff on the other
have essentially the same effect on the spectra. For this reason, spectra of
dusty dwarfs were in fact misinterpreted in general, also by ourselves. We show
that the degeneracy of T_eff and T_cr can be removed to some extent by the
analysis of the spectra transformed to the SEDs on an absolute scale. Our
reanalysis of some spectra revealed that the L-T spectral sequence is not a
sequence of T_eff, at least between middle L and early T types, but should be
interpreted as a sequence of T_cr. In other words, the L-T spectral sequence
has little to do with T_eff but reflects a change of the thickness of the dust
cloud. Although this unexpected result is based on a limited sample, an odd
``brightening'' of the absolute magnitudes (e.g., M_J and M_bol) plotted
against the L-T spectral types may also be a manifestation that the L-T
spectral sequence is not a temperature sequence. :

presents three new binary periods and confirms two X-ray periods using optical
data for objects in this group. This homogeneous sample has been studied as a
group to determine important general characteristics that may offer insight
into the evolution of such systems. In particular, the spectral class
distribution shows a much greater agreement with those of isolated Be stars,
and appears to be in some disagreement with the galactic population of Be stars
in Be/X-ray binaries. Studies of the long term optical modulation of the Be
star companions reveal an extremely variable group of objects, a fact which
will almost certainly make a major contribution to the pronounced X-ray
variability. The spatial distribution of these systems within the SMC is
investigated and strongly suggests a link between massive star formation and
the HI density distribution. Finally, studies of the circumstellar disk
characteristics reveal a strong link with optical variability offering
important clues into the long-term stability of such disks.

mass is viewed as a high density/high energy plasma. This model challenges our
current understanding of the densities associated with the internal layers of
the Sun, advocating a relatively constant density, almost independent of radial
position. The incompressible nature of liquids is advanced to prevent solar
collapse from gravitational forces. The liquid plasma model of the Sun is a
non-equilibrium approach, where nuclear reactions are free to occur throughout
the solar mass. The primary means of addressing internal heat transfer are
convection and conduction. As a result of the convective processes on the solar
surface, the liquid model brings into question the established temperature of
the solar photosphere by highlighting a violation of Kirchhoff's law of thermal
emission. Along these lines, the model emphasizes that radiative emission is a
surface phenomenon. Strong evidence is provided that the Sun is a high
density/high energy liquid plasma. This evidence is based on our knowledge of
Planckian thermal emission and condensed matter, including the existence of
pressure ionization and liquid metallic hydrogen at high temperatures and
pressures. The equations of magnetohydrodynamics are invoked as the proper
vehicle for the understanding od stellar convection and structure. Prior to
introducing the liquid plasma model, the historic and scientific justifications
for the gaseous model of the Sun are reviewed and the gaseous equations of
state are also discussed.

c, we show analytically that traceroute sampling gives an observed degree

distribution is Poisson. For graphs whose degree distributions have power-law
tails P(k) ~ k^-alpha, traceroute sampling from a small number of sources can
significantly underestimate the value of \alpha when the graph has a large
excess (i.e., many more edges than vertices). We find that in order to obtain a
good estimate of alpha it is necessary to use a number of sources which grows
linearly in the average degree of the underlying graph. Based on these

take on a specific set of extreme values. These initial conditions lead us to
the discovery of the emergence of four distinct phases. Studying the
transitions between these phases, allows us to establish a rigorous
classification based on their tempo-spatial behavioral characteristics. As a
result from the system's complex dynamics, its flow-density relation exhibits a
non-concave region in which forward propagating density waves are encountered.
All four phases furthermore share the common property that moving vehicles can
never increase their speed once the system has settled into an equilibrium.

  after all",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  High magnetic field studies of cuprate superconductors revealed a non-BCS
temperature dependence of the upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ determined
resistively by several groups.
  These determinations caused some doubts on the grounds of both the
contrasting effect of the magnetic field on the in-plane and out-of-plane
resistances reported for large Bi2212 sample and the large Nernst signal
\emph{well above} $T_{c}$.
  Here we present both $\rho_{ab}(B)$ and $\rho_{c}(B)$ of tiny Bi2212 crystals
in magnetic fields up to 50 Tesla.
  None of our measurements revealed a situation when on the field increase
$\rho_c$ reaches its maximum while $\rho_{ab}$ remains very small if not zero.
  The resistive %upper critical fields estimated from the in-plane and
out-of-plane $H_{c2}(T)$ estimated from $\rho_{ab}(B)$ and $\rho_{c}(B)$ are
approximately the same. Our results support any theory of cuprates that
describes the state above the resistive phase transition as perfectly normal
with a zero off-diagonal order parameter. In particular, the anomalous Nernst
effect above the resistive phase transition in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates can be
described quantitatively as a normal state phenomenon in a model with itinerant
and localised fermions and/or charged bosons.

(LAP) is still not in the mainstream of Information Systems Development (ISD).
Since at present there is only a limited understanding of LAP theory and
practice, it remains unclear whether the lack of LAP's impact is due to
shortcomings in LAP theory itself. One classic problem within ISD is the
dichotomy between social perspectives and technical perspectives. LAP claims it
offers a solution to this problem. This paper investigates this claim as a
means to review LAP theory. To provide a structure to a critical analysis of
DEMO - an example methodology that belongs to the LAP research community - this
paper utilizes a paradigmatic framework. This framework is augmented by the
opinion of several DEMO practitioners by means of an expert discussion. With
use of a comparative evaluation of LAP theory and DEMO theory, the implication
of DEMO's reflection upon LAP is determined. The paper concludes by outlining
an agenda for further research if LAP is to improve its footprint in the field.

  This dynamical mass generation enables us to explain the infrared Abelian
dominance and monopole dominance by way of a non-Abelian Stokes theorem, which
supports the dual superconductivity picture of quark confinement. Moreover, we
show that the instability of Savvidy vacuum disappears by sufficiently large
color magnetic condensation.

the case of the commensurate SW solutions the analysis reduces to the
eigenvalue problem of a transfer matrix depending parametrically on the
eigenfrequency. The spectrum of eigenfrequencies and the corresponding
eigenmodes can thereby be determined exactly. The spatial periodicity of a
commensurate SW implies that the eigenmodes are of the Bloch form,
characterised by an even number of Floquet multipliers. The spectrum is made up
of bands that, in general, include a number of transition points corresponding
to changes in the disposition of the Floquet multipliers. The latter
characterise the different band segments. An alternative characterisation of
the segments is in terms of the Krein signatures associated with the
eigenfrequencies. When one or more parameters characterising the SW solution is
made to vary, one occasionally encounters collisions between the band-edges or
the intra-band transition points and, depending on the the Krein signatures of
the colliding bands or segments, the spectrum may stretch out in the complex
plane, leading to the onset of instability. We elucidate the correlation
between the disposition of Floquet multipliers and the Krein signatures,
presenting two specific examples where the SW possesses a definite window of
stability, as distinct from the SW's obtained close to the anticontinuous and
linear limits of the DNLS model.

utilize effective interactions, the present one employs directly

  2004, proceedings published by AIP and edited by M.S. El-Genk",,"10.1063/1.1649680",,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The generation of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves (HFGW) has been
identified as the required breakthrough that will lead to new forms of space
propulsion. Many techniques have been devised to generate HFGW, but most of
them exhibit marginal efficiency, therefore the power emitted in form of
gravitational waves (GW) is orders of magnitude lower than the input power. The
gravitational wave counterpart of the LASER, termed Gravitational-wave LASER or
""GASER"" is the quantum approach to the efficient generation of gravitational
waves. Electrons, protons, muons, etc, all have charge and mass, if accelerated
they usually lose energy through the very fast electric and magnetic channels,
this causes a negligible emission through the gravitational channel. Quantum
systems can be engineered to forbid electric and magnetic transitions,
therefore the gravitational spin-2 transitions can take place. A class of
active materials, suitable for making a GASER based on electronic transitions
in the solid state, is identified along with their relevant physical
properties. Means for creating coherence and population inversion and means to
increase the emission probability are described. The expected performances of
the device are derived from quantum gravitational theories. Additional
properties of the active materials are considered to enforce the theoretical
foundation of the device. A proof-of-concept device, operating at about 1 THz,
is described. Experiments are proposed as a natural starting point of the
research.

for genetic toggle switches formed from pairs of genes that mutually repress
each other. In order to determine the stability of the genetic switches, we
make a connection with reactive flux theory and transition state theory. The
switch stability is characterised by a well defined lifetime $\tau$. We find
that $\tau$ grows exponentially with the mean number $\Nmean$ of transcription
factor molecules involved in the switching. In the regime accessible to direct
numerical simulations, the growth law is well characterised by
$\tau\sim\Nmean{}^{\alpha}\exp(b\Nmean)$, where $\alpha$ and $b$ are
parameters. The switch stability is decreased by phenomena that increase the
noise in gene expression, such as the production of multiple copies of a
protein from a single mRNA transcript (shot noise), and fluctuations in the
number of proteins produced per transcript. However, robustness against
biochemical noise can be drastically enhanced by arranging the transcription
factor binding domains on the DNA such that competing transcription factors
mutually exclude each other on the DNA. We also elucidate the origin of the
enhanced stability of the exclusive switch with respect to that of the general
switch: while the kinetic prefactor is roughly the same for both switches, the
`barrier' for flipping the switch is significantly higher for the exclusive
switch than for the general switch.

prove in a specific case that the model can be made again consistent with
