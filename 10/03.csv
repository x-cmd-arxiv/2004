collapse in an expanding background using a 2D TreePM code and study the
strongly non-linear regime ($\bar\xi \leq 200$) for power law models. Evolution
of these models is found to be scale-invariant in all our simulations. We find
that the stable clustering limit is not reached, but there is a model
independent non-linear scaling relation in the asymptotic regime. This confirms
results from an earlier study which only probed the mildly non-linear regime
($\bar\xi \leq 40$). The correlation function in the extremely non-linear
regime is a less steep function of scale than reported in earlier studies. We
show that this is due to coherent transverse motions in massive haloes. We also
study density profiles and find that the scatter in the inner and outer slopes
is large and that there is no single universal profile that fits all cases. We
find that the difference in typical density profiles for different models is
smaller than expected from similarity solutions for halo profiles and
transverse motions induced by substructure are a likely reason for this
difference being small.

has an impressive record obtaining high time resolution, usually it is achieved

has the potential to change this situation, opening up new parameter space in
the search for radio transients. We summarize the wide variety of known and
hypothesized radio transients and demonstrate that the SKA offers considerable
power in exploring this parameter space. Requirements on the SKA to search the
parameter space include the abilities to (1) Make targeted searches using
beamforming capability; (2) Conduct blind, all-sky surveys with dense sampling
of the frequency-time plane in wide fields; (3) Sample the sky with multiple
fields of view from spatially well-separated sites in order to discriminate
celestial and terrestrial signals; (4) Utilize as much of the SKA's aggregate
collecting area as possible in blind surveys, thus requiring a centrally
condensed configuration; and (5) Localize repeating transient sources to high

requiring collecting area in both a centrally condensed ""core"" array and

understanding of stellar evolution. The rotational evolution of solar-mass
stars is mainly determined by the magnetic interaction with their circumstellar
disk and angular momentum loss through stellar winds, and In contrast to
solar-mass stars, very low mass (VLM) objects and brown dwarfs are believed to
be fully convective. This may lead to major differences of rotation and
activity, since fully convective objects may not host a solar-type dynamo.
Here, we report on our observational efforts to understand the rotational
evolution of VLM objects. By means of photometric monitoring, we determined 62
rotation periods for targets in three clusters, which form an age sequence from
3 to 125 Myr. We find that VLM objects rotate faster than their solar-mass
siblings in all evolutionary stages. Their rotational evolution seems to be
determined by hydrostatic contraction and exponential angular momentum loss.
The photometric amplitudes of the light curves are much lower than for
solar-mass stars. This may be explained as a consequence of smaller spot
coverage, more symmetric spot distributions, or lower contrast between spots
and their environment. Most of these results can be explained with a change of
the magnetic field properties with decreasing mass. VLM objects possibly
possess only small-scale, turbulent magnetic fields.

from the original analyses of the simulations, we see some evidence for
artificial overmerging in the innermost regions of the simulated haloes, either

group-finding algorithms used to identify substructure are not detecting all
the bound clumps in the highest-density regions. Our analytic results suggest
that greater mass and force resolution may be required before numerical
overmerging becomes negligible in all current applications. We discuss the
implications of this result for observational and experimental tests of halo

Compton cooling by MeV photons immediately terminates the optical emission

explain the non-detections of optical flashes in several long GRBs. Such failed
optical flashes should be especially efficient GeV producers and likely to
develop e+- cascades. This probably happened in GRB 941017, and its mysterious
high-energy component is well explained by Compton upscattering of GRB photons
at the fireball deceleration radius. The proposed mechanism of GeV emission
should not work for short gamma-ray bursts that early decouple from the

Observations by Swift and GLAST will provide an opportunity to test these
expectations. The existing data for GRB 990123 already impose interesting

P_2 are pseudoscalar mesons), through a flavor changing dipole transition, time
dependent oscillations can reveal the presence of physics beyond the Standard
Model. If P_1 and P_2 are CP eigenstates (e.g. as in B_d -> K_S pi0 gamma), the
oscillation is independent of the resonance structure. Thus data from
resonances as well as from nonresonant decays can be included. This may
significantly enhance the sensitivity to new physics of the method. If P_1 is a
charged particle, and P_2 its anti-particle (e.g. as in B_d -> pi+ pi- gamma),
one has the additional advantage that both the magnitude and the weak phase of
any new physics contribution can be determined from a study of the angular
distribution. These signals offer excellent ways to detect new physics because
they are suppressed in the Standard Model. We also show that the potential
contamination of these signals originating from the Standard Model annihilation
diagram gives rise to photons with, to a very good approximation, the same
helicity as the dominant penguin graph and thus causes no serious difficulty.

cross section is constrained by the experimental limit of the pseudo-scalar
coupling from $\tau \to \mu\eta$ decays. We find that at a muon energy
($E_{\mu}$) higher than 50 GeV, the predicted cross section increases
significantly due to the contribution from sea $b$-quarks. As a result, with
$10^{20}$ muons per year, at most a number of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ is expected
for $\mu N \to \tau X$ events at $E_{\mu}$= 300 GeV, whereas
$\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ events are given at $E_{\mu}= 50$ GeV. Furthermore, the
$\mu N \to \tau X$ phenomenology, in particular that for the signal and

the $e N \to \tau X$ reaction at an electron-positron linear collider is also

Pitaevskii proposed to model the dynamics of such system by a nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation, the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The GP hierarchy is
an infinite BBGKY hierarchy of equations so that if $u_t$ solves the GP
equation, then the family of $k$-particle density matrices $\{\otimes_k u_t,
k\ge 1 \}$ solves the GP hierarchy. We prove that as $N\to \infty$ the limit
points of the $k$-particle density matrices of $\psi_{N,t}$ are solutions of
the GP hierarchy. The uniqueness of the solutions to this hierarchy remains an
open question. Our analysis requires that the $N$ boson dynamics is described
by a modified Hamiltonian which cuts off the pair interactions whenever at
least three particles come into a region with diameter much smaller than the
typical inter-particle distance. Our proof can be extended to a modified
Hamiltonian which only forbids at least $n$ particles from coming close
together, for any fixed $n$.

is strongly affected by photonic bandgaps of spatially periodic media with
multilevel dopants. This mechanism is shown to be capable of fully entangling
two single-photon pulses with high fidelity.
