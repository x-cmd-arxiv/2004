discuss the simplest possibility for the scaling of the string energy density:
$\varrho \propto R^{-2}$. For such models we write down the explicit solution
of the Friedman equation. We realize that corresponding cosmological models do
not essentially differ from those without strings. We find an analytic formula
for the radial coordinate $\chi$ of a galaxy with a redshift z and express it
in terms of astronomical parameters. This relation is then used for the
derivation of the astrophysical formulas such as luminosity distance, angular
diameter, and source counts, which may serve for testing the string-dominated
universe. It seems that the most sensitive test, at least from the formal point
of view, is the formula for the number of galaxies $N(z)$ corresponding to a
given value of the redshift. We show that the maximum of $N(z)$ strongly
depends on the density of strings, especially if the density is large enough to
explain the $\Omega$ problem. Other tests are also proposed.

the vsini distributions differ as well, but with a lower degree of statistical

these differences may reflect the effects of the higher accretion rates that
theory suggests are characteristic of regions that give birth to dense
clusters, namely: (a) higher initial rotation speeds; (b) higher initial radii
along the stellar birthline, resulting in greater spinup between the birthline
and the ZAMS; and (c) a more pronounced maximum in the birthline radius-mass
relationship that results in differentially greater spinup for stars that
become mid- to late- B stars on the ZAMS.

projection effects and the physical processes at work during this special time

of activity we see in the cluster. We argue that tidal effects on individual
cluster members, often far from the cluster core, are responsible for the
increased star formation. Our results are consistent with the idea that disk
galaxies during this phase of a cluster's evolution undergo rapid evolution,

theories. Our model uses Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a
LCDM cosmology, coupled to semi-analytical recipes, to follow the merger
history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the MBHs they host, and their
growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences. The coalescence of comparable
mass holes increases the spin of MBHs, while the capture of smaller companions
in randomly-oriented orbits acts to spin holes down. We find that, given the
distribution of MBH binary mass ratios in hierarchical models, binary
coalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spin-up or spin-down of MBHs
with time: the spin distribution retains memory of its initial conditions. By
contrast, because of the Bardeen-Petterson effect, gas accretion via a thin
disk tends to spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis changes
randomly in time. In our models, accretion dominates over black hole captures
and efficiently spins holes up. The spin distribution is heavily skewed towards
fast-rotating Kerr holes, is already in place at early epochs, and does not
change much below redshift 5. If accretion is via a thin disk, about 70% of all
MBHs are maximally rotating and have radiative efficiencies approaching 30%
(assuming a ""standard'' spin-efficiency conversion). Even in the conservative
case where accretion is via a geometrically thick disk, about 80% of all MBHs
have spin parameters a/m > 0.8 and accretion efficiencies > 12%. Rapidly
spinning holes with high radiative efficiencies may satisfy constraints based
on comparing the local MBH mass density with the mass density inferred from

readily detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), but an
electromagnetic afterglow would be helpful in pinpointing the source and its
redshift. Long before the merger, the binary ""hollows out"" any surrounding gas
and shrinks slowly compared to the viscous timescale of a circumbinary disk.
The inner gas disk is truncated at the radius where gravitational torque from
the binary balances the viscous torque, and accretion onto the black holes is
diminished. Initially, the inner truncation radius is able to follow the
shrinking binary inward. But eventually the gravitational radiation timescale
becomes shorter than the viscous timescale in the disk, leading to a merged
black hole surrounded by a hollow disk of gas. We show that the subsequent
viscous evolution of the hollow, radiation-pressure dominated disk will create
a ~10^{43.5}(M/10^6Msun) ergs s^{-1} X-ray source on a timescale

(IMF) is a fundamental problem in star formation theory. One of the major
uncertainties is the exact chemical state of the star forming gas and its
influence on the dynamical evolution. Most simulations of star forming clusters
use an isothermal equation of state (EOS). However, theoretical predictions and
observations suggest that the effective polytropic exponent gamma in the EOS
varies with density.
  We address these issues and study the effect of a piecewise polytropic EOS on
the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent, self-gravitating molecular
clouds using three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. To
approximate the results of published predictions of the thermal behavior of
collapsing clouds, we increase the polytropic exponent gamma from 0.7 to 1.1 at
some chosen density n_c, which we vary. The change of thermodynamic state at
n_c selects a characteristic mass scale for fragmentation M_ch, which we relate
to the peak of the observed IMF. Our investigation generally supports the idea
that the distribution of stellar masses depends mainly on the thermodynamic
state of the star-forming gas. The thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is a
result of the balance between heating and cooling processes, which in turn are
determined by fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical
abundances. Given the abundances, the derivation of a characteristic stellar
mass can thus be based on universal quantities and constants.

Our objective is to define an evolutionary method that can be used for low and
high redshift objects. We estimate the concentration of light (C) at the galaxy
center and the 180 degree-rotational asymmetry (A), computed at several
wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to I-band. The variation of the indices of
concentration and asymmetry with the wavelength reflects the proportion and the
distribution of young and old stellar populations in galaxies. In general C is
found to decrease from optical to UV, and A is found to increase from optical
to UV: the patchy appearance of galaxies in UV with no bulge is often very
different from their counterpart at optical wavelengths, with prominent bulges
and more regular disks. The variation of C and A with the wavelength is
quantified. By this way, we are able to distinguish five types of galaxies that
we call spectro-morphological types: compact, ringed, spiral, irregular and
central-starburst galaxies, which can be differentiated by the repartition of
their stellar populations. We discuss in detail the morphology of galaxies of
the sample, and describe the morphological characteristics of each
spectro-morphological type. We apply spectro-morphology to three objects at a
redshift z=1 in the Hubble Deep Field North, that gives encouraging results for
applications to large samples of high-redshift galaxies. This method of
morphological classification could be used to study the evolution of the
morphology with the redshift and is expected to bring observational constraints

(1998)], the endblocks of the polymer chains are modeled as hydrophobic rods
representing the alpha-helical part of the polypeptides whereas the central
B-block is hydrophilic and semi-flexible. We have determined structural
properties, such as the hydrophobic cluster-size distribution function, the
geometric percolation point and pair correlation functions, and related these
to the dynamical properties of the system. Upon decrease of the temperature, a
network structure is formed in which bundles of endblocks act as network
junctions. Both at short and medium distances an increased ordering is
observed, as characterized by the pair correlation function. Micelle formation
and the corresponding onset of geometric percolation induce a strong change in
dynamical quantities, e.g., in the diffusion constant and the viscosity, and
causes the system to deviate from the Stokes-Einstein relation. The dynamical
properties show a temperature dependence that is strongly reminiscent of the
behavior of glass-forming liquids. The appearance of a plateau in the stress
autocorrelation function suggests that the system starts to exhibit a
solid-like response to applied stress once the network structure has been
formed, although the actual sol-gel transition occurs only at a considerably

theoretical and experimental interest. Ageing phenomena are observed during
this ever-lasting non-equilibrium evolution. A simple instance of such a
behaviour is provided by the dynamics that takes place when a system is
quenched from its high-temperature phase to the critical point. The aim of this
review is to summarize the various numerical and analytical results that have
been recently obtained for this case. Particular emphasis is put to the
field-theoretical methods that can be used to provide analytical predictions
for the relevant dynamical quantities. Fluctuation-dissipation relations are
discussed and in particular the concept of fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR)
is reviewed, emphasizing its connection with the definition of a possible
effective temperature. The Renormalization-Group approach to critical dynamics
is summarized and the scaling forms of the time-dependent non-equilibrium
correlation and response functions of a generic observable are discussed. From
them the universality of the associated FDR follows as an amplitude ratio. It
is then possible to provide predictions for ageing quantities in a variety of
different models. In particular the results for Model A, B, and C dynamics of
the O(N) Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian, and Model A dynamics of the weakly dilute
Ising magnet and of a \phi^3 theory, are reviewed and compared with the
available numerical results and exact solutions. The effect of a planar surface
on the ageing behaviour of Model A dynamics is also addressed within the
mean-field approximation.

fractions, using the moment free energy method. The intricate features of phase
separation in pure polydisperse colloids combine with the appearance of
polymer-induced gas-liquid coexistence to give a rich variety of phase diagram
topologies as the polymer-colloid size ratio and the colloid polydispersity are
varied. Quantitatively, we find that polydispersity disfavours fluid-solid
against gas-liquid separation, causing a substantial lowering of the threshold
value above which stable two-phase gas-liquid coexistence appears. Phase splits
involving two or more solids can occur already at low colloid concentration,
where they may be kinetically accessible. We also analyse the strength of
colloidal size fractionation. When a solid phase separates from a fluid, its
polydispersity is reduced most strongly if the phase separation takes place at
low colloid concentration and high polymer concentration, in agreement with
experimental observations. For fractionation in gas-liquid coexistence we
likewise find good agreement with experiment, as well as with perturbative
theories for near-monodisperse systems.

(BPW) which successfully described fermion masses and neutrino oscillations, to
include CP violation. Assuming flavor universal SUSY breaking parameters at M^*
>~ M_{GUT}, and that CP violation arises through phases in the fermion mass
matrices, we show how the presence of GUT threshold induces new and calculable
CP and flavor violations. Including SM and SUSY contributions, we find that the
BPW framework can correctly account for the observed flavor and/or CP
violations in \Delta m_K, \Delta m_{B_d}, S(B_d-> J/\psi K_S) and \epsilon_K.
While SUSY-contribution is small (<~ few%) for the first three quantities, that
to \epsilon_K is sizable (~ 20-25%) and negative (as desired) compared to that
of the SM. The model predicts S(B_d-> \phi K_S) to be in the range
+(0.65-0.73), close to the SM prediction. The model yields
Re(\epsilon'/\epsilon)_{SUSY}\approx +(4-14)\times 10^{-4}; the relevance of
this contribution can be assessed only when the associated matrix elements are
known reliably. The model also predicts that the electric dipole moments of the

invariant mass spectrum and the $cos\theta_\pi^*$ distribution in the
$\Upsilon(3S)\to\Upsilon(1S)\pi^+\pi^-$ process can simultaneously be
well-explained, but also a consistent description for other bottomonia $
\pi^+\pi^-$ transitions can be obtained. As a consequence, the mass and the
width of the intermediate state are predicted. From the quark content analysis,
this state should be a $b\bar bq\bar q$ state.

unstable, typically with a short lifetime compared to the string scale. We find
that the lifetime of the average string state of mass M has the asymptotic form
T < const.1/(g^2 M). The most stable string state seems to be a certain state
with high angular momentum which can be classically viewed as a circular string
rotating in several planes (""the rotating ring""), predominantly decaying by
radiating soft massless NS-NS particles, with a lifetime T = c_0 M^5/g^2.
Remarkably, the dominant channel is the decay into a similar rotating ring
state of smaller mass. The total lifetime to shrink to zero size is ~ M^7. In
the presence of D branes, decay channels involving open strings in the final
state are exponentially suppressed, so the lifetime is still proportional to
M^5, except for a D brane at a special angle or flux. For large mass, the
spectrum for massless emission exhibits qualitative features typical of a
thermal spectrum, such as a maximum and an exponential tail. We also discuss
the decay properties of rotating rings in the case of compact dimensions.

that for the case with a positive constant curvature, there is a critical value
for the Born-Infeld parameter, above which the black hole is also always

non-linear, both black hole horizon entropy and cosmological horizon entropy
can be expressed in terms of the Cardy-Verlinde formula. We also find a
factorized solution in the Einstein-Born-Infeld theory, which is a direct

the point of largest fluctuations providing another indication of a liquid gas

of temperature with excitation energy and no apparent plateau. The temperature
at the point of maximal fluctuations is $8.3 \pm 0.5$ MeV. Taking this

polarizabilities have an intuitive interpretation in terms of induced dipole
moments and thus characterize the response of the constituents of the nucleon

single cutoff scale, $\bar \Lambda = 0.7 $GeV, effectively representing all

consistent with the one required to reproduce the empirical saturation point of

explanation in terms of an almost complete cancellation between short-range

that by the field redefinition some models can be equivalently transformed into

couplings can be reduced to a restricted set of functions with a constrained
dependence on a scalar field. We show how by choosing properly the latter
scaling functions one may stiffen or soften the equation of state at high
densities and simultaneously increase the threshold density for the direct Urca
process without any change of the description of nuclear matter close to the
saturation density. The stiffening of the equation of state might be motivated
by recent neutron star mass measurements, whereas the increase of the threshold
density for the direct Urca process is required by the analysis of neutron star
cooling data. We demonstrate that if a rho meson is included in a mean-field
model as a non-Abelian gauge boson, then there is a possibility for a charged
rho-meson condensation in dense nuclear matter. We show that such a novel phase
can be realized in neutron star interiors already for sufficiently low
densities, typically $\sim 3\div 4 n_0$, where $n_0$ is the nuclear saturation
density. In the framework of the relativistic mean field model the new phase
arises in a second-order phase transition. The appearance of a $\rho^-$
condensate significantly alters the proton fraction in a neutron star but
changes moderately the equation of state. The neutrino emissivity of the

used. As expected, the expressions for the energy-momentum conservation laws
are identical in both variational formulations. The connection between the two

Hamiltonian and/or couplings with an environment (decoherence), plays an
important role in controlling quantum systems. There are many efficient
decoupling schemes based on combinatorial concepts like orthogonal arrays,
difference schemes and Hadamard matrices. So far these (combinatorial)
decoupling schemes have relied on the ability to effect sequences of
instantaneous, arbitrarily strong control Hamiltonians (bang-bang controls). To
overcome the shortcomings of bang-bang control Viola and Knill proposed a
method called Eulerian decoupling that allows the use of bounded-strength
controls for decoupling. However, their method was not directly designed to
take advantage of the composite structure of multipartite quantum systems. In
this paper we define a combinatorial structure called an Eulerian orthogonal
array. It merges the desirable properties of orthogonal arrays and Eulerian
cycles in Cayley graphs (that are the basis of Eulerian decoupling). We show
that this structure gives rise to decoupling schemes with bounded-strength
control Hamiltonians that can be applied to composite quantum systems with few
body Hamiltonians and special couplings with the environment. Furthermore, we
show how to construct Eulerian orthogonal arrays having good parameters in
order to obtain efficient decoupling schemes.

outside the scope of existing methods of decoherence control. We demonstate
that an appropriate sequence of nearly abrupt changes of the resonance
frequency can protect the qubit state from decay and decoherence more
effectively than the intuitively obvious alternative, which is to fix the
resonance well within a forbidden bandgap of the reservoir spectrum, as far as
possible from the continuum edge. The ""counterintuitive"" nonadiabatic method
outlined here can outperform its adiabatic counterparts in maintaining a high
fidelity of quantum logic operations. The remarkable effectiveness of the

previously proposed control methods, is due to the ability of appropriately
alternating detunings from the continuum edge to augment the interference of
the emitted and back-scattered quanta, thereby helping to stabilize the qubit
