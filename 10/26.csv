La Palma as the most suitable site for adaptive optics, with a mean value of
22.13 m/s at the 200 mbar pressure level. La Silla is at the bottom of the
ranking, with the largest average value 200 mbar wind speed(33.35 m/s). We have
found a clear annual periodicity of high altitude winds for the five sites in
study. We have also explored the connection of high to low altitude atmospheric
winds as a first approach of the linear relationship between the average
velocity of the turbulence and high altitude winds (Sarazin & Tokovinin 2001).
We may conclude that high and low altitude winds show good linear relationships
at the five selected sites. The highest correlation coefficients correspond to
Paranal and San Pedro Martir, while La Palma and La Silla show similar high to
low altitude wind connection. Mauna Kea shows the smallest degree of
correlation, which suggests a weaker linear relationship. Our results support
the idea of high altitude winds as a parameter for rank astronomical sites in
terms of their suitability for adaptive optics, although we have no evidence
for adopting the same linear coefficient at different sites. The final value of
this linear coefficient at a particular site could drastically change the
interpretation of high altitude wind speeds as a direct parameter for site
characterization.

extrasolar giant planets for a distance limited sample of the nearest known
extrasolar planets. Using recent results on the correlation between stellar
X-ray flux and mass-loss rates from nearby stars, we estimate the expected
mass-loss rates of the host stars of extrasolar planets that lie within 20pc of
the Earth. We find that some of the host stars have mass-loss rates that are
more than 100 times that of the Sun, and given the expected dependence of the
planetary magnetospheric radio flux on stellar wind properties this has a very
substantial effect. Using these results and extrapolations of the likely
magnetic properties of the extrasolar planets we infer their likely radio
properties.
  We compile a list of the most promising radio targets, and conclude that the
planets orbiting Tau Bootes, Gliese 86, Upsilon Andromeda and HD1237 (as well
as HD179949) are the most promising candidates, with expected flux levels that
should be detectable in the near future with upcoming telescope arrays. The
expected emission peak from these candidate radio emitting planets is typically
\~40-50 MHz. We also discuss a range of observational considerations for
detecting extrasolar giant planets.

of growth. We consider both our general sample of 26 sightlines and a more
restrictive sample of 10 sightlines that utilize HST data for a measurement of
the weak 1355 angstrom line of oxygen, and are thus better constrained due to
our sampling of all three sections of the curve of growth. The column densities
of our HST sample show ratios of O/H that agree with the current best solar
value if dust is considered, with the possible exception of one sightline (HD
37903). We note some very limited evidence in the HST sample for trends of
increasing depletion with respect to the ratio of total to selective extinction
and the molecular fraction of hydrogen, but the trends are not conclusive.
Unlike a recent result from Cartledge et al. (2004), we do not see evidence for
increasing depletion with respect to the average volume density of hydrogen,
but our HST sample contains only two points more dense than the critical
density determined in that paper. The column densities of our more general
sample show some scatter in O/H, but most agree with the solar value to within
errors. We discuss these results in the context of establishing the best method
for determining interstellar abundances, the unresolved question of the best
value for O/H in the interstellar medium (ISM), the O/H ratios observed in

bimodal color-magnitude (CM) distribution with environment. Dividing the galaxy
population by environment (Sigma_5) and luminosity (-23<M_r<-17), the u-r color
functions are modeled using double-Gaussian functions. This enables a
deconvolution of the CM distributions into two populations: red and blue
sequences. The changes with increasing environmental density can be separated
into two effects: a large increase in the fraction of galaxies in the red
distribution, and a small color shift in the CM relations of each distribution.
The average color shifts are 0.05+-0.01 and 0.11+-0.02 for the red and blue
distributions, respectively, over a factor of 100 in projected neighbor
density. The red fraction varies between about 0% and 70% for low-luminosity
galaxies and between about 50% and 90% for high-luminosity galaxies. This
difference is also shown by the variation of the luminosity functions with
environment. We demonstrate that the effects of environment and luminosity can
be unified. A combined quantity, Sigma_mod = Sigma_5/Mpc^{-2} + L_r/L_{-20.2},
predicts the fraction of red galaxies, which may be related to the probability
of transformation events. Our results are consistent with major interactions
(mergers and/or harassment) causing galaxies to transform from the blue to the

expansion is linear with H_0 = 72 +/- 8 km/s/Mpc, and that the properties of
dust in other galaxies are generally similar to those of dust in the Milky Way.
The measured luminosity distances of SNe Ia as a function of redshift have
shown that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating, probably
due to the presence of repulsive dark energy such as Einstein's cosmological
constant (Lambda). From about 200 SNe Ia, we find that Omega_Lambda - 1.4
Omega_M = 0.35 +/- 0.14. Combining our data with other results, we find a best
fit for Omega_M and Omega_Lambda of 0.28 and 0.72, respectively. A number of
possible systematic effects (dust, supernova evolution) thus far do not seem to
eliminate the need for Omega_Lambda > 0. Recently, analyses of SNe Ia at z =
1.0-1.7 provide further support for current acceleration, and give tentative
evidence for an early epoch of deceleration. The dynamical age of the Universe
is estimated to be 13.1 +/- 1.5 Gyr. According to the most recent data sets,
the SN Ia rate at z > 1 is several times greater than that at low redshifts,
presumably because of higher star formation rates long ago. Moreover, the
typical delay time from progenitor star formation to SNIa explosion appears to
be substantial, ~3 Gyr. Current projects include the measurement of a few
hundred SNe Ia at z = 0.2-0.8 to more accurately determine the
equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy, w = P/(\rho c^2), whose value

galaxy containing a supermassive binary black hole with unequal masses. We
assume that over the separation distance between the black holes the
gravitational potential is dominated by the more massive black hole. Also, we
assume that the number density of stars is concentric with the primary black
hole and has a power law cusp.We show that the bulk of stars with a small
angular-momentum component normal to the black hole binary orbit can reach a
small value of total angular momentum through secular evolution in the
gravitational field of the binary, and hence they can be tidally disrupted.
This effect is analogous to the so-called Kozai effect (Kozai, 1962, Lidov,
1961,1962) well known in celestial mechanics. We develop an analytical theory
of secular evolution of the stellar orbits and calculate the rate of tidal
disruption. We confront our analytical theory with a simple numerical model and
find very good agreement.
  Our results show that for primary black-hole mass \sim
10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}, the black- hole mass ratio q > 10^{-2}, cusp size \sim
1pc, the tidal disruption rate can be as large as \sim 10^{-2}-1M_{\odot}/yr.
This is at least 10^{2}-10^{4} times larger than estimated for the case of a
single supermassive black hole. The duration of the phase of enhanced tidal
disruption is determined by the dynamical friction time scale, and it is rather
short: \sim 10^{5}yr. The dependence of the tidal disruption rate on the mass
ratio, as well as on the size of the cusp, is also discussed.

(l,b)=(240,-8) found by Martin et al. (2004), which has been proposed as the
remnant of a dwarf satellite accreted onto the Milky Way on a near-equatorial
orbit. We find a narrow (in apparent magnitude) main-sequence, extending 6
magnitudes below the turn-off to our limiting magnitude of B ~ 24.5 mag. This
main sequence has very high constrast (>3) with respect to the thin/thick
disk/halo background; its narrowness at brighter magnitudes clearly implies the
presence of a distinct and possibly still bound stellar system. We derived the
line-of-sight size (r_{1/2}) of this system based on the B-band width of the
lower main sequence, obtaining 0.94 +/- 0.18 (random) +/- 0.18 (systematic)
kpc. That size matches a model prediction for the main body of the parent
galaxy of the Monoceros tidal stream. The high density contrast and limited
spatial extent in the radial direction are very hard to reconcile with the
alternative explanation put forward to explain the Canis Major
stellar-overdensity: a flared or warped Galactic disk viewed in projection
(Momamy et al. 2004). We also derived a central surface brightness of mu_{V,0}=
23.3 +/- 0.1 mag arcsec^{-2} and an absolute magnitude of M_{V}=-14.5 +/- 0.1
mag. These values place the Canis Major object in the category of dwarf galaxy
in the the L_{V}--size and M_V - mu_{V} planes for such objects. However, like
the Sagittarius dwarf, it is an outlier in the[Fe/H] -M_V plane in the sense
that it is too metal rich for its estimated absolute magnitude. This suggests
that the main mechanism driving its recent and current star formation history
(possibly tidal stripping) is different to that of isolated dwarfs.

the lensing galaxy. Mass models of the system (assuming same-plane deflectors)
that take the local group environment into account do better at explaining the
observed emission-line flux ratios (which are presumably unaffected by
microlensing) than single halo models, but the match is still not perfect. In
particular, component A (a minimum of the light travel time) is observed to be
0.20 mag brighter than predicted and component C (also a minimum image) is
observed to be 0.16 mag fainter than predicted. Mass models for the system
predict an A-D time delay of either 15.8 or 17.6 days (Ho = 72 km/s/Mpc)
depending on the details of the local galaxy environment.

constraints on extragalactic background light (EBL) from the optical to the

we assume a power-law unabsorbed spectrum. We find that an EBL model with no
excess over known galaxies in the near-infrared background (NIRB) is in
agreement with all the considered blazars; however, it implies a very peculiar
intrinsic spectrum for H 1426+428. Additional data on the blazars 1ES1101-232,
H 2356-309 and PKS 2155-304 exclude the existence of a strong NIRB excess
consistent with Kelsall's model of zodiacal light subtraction (ZL); the
COBE/DIRBE measurements, after Wright's model ZL subtraction, represent a firm
NIRB upper limit. The constraints on the optical EBL are weaker, due to the
fact that predictions from different optical EBL models are often comparable to
the experimental errors. In the mid-infrared the SPITZER measurement at 24
micron gives a good fit for all the considered blazars.

to limiting magnitude R>23. While an X-ray source, AX/RX J1606.8+8130, was

at least factor of 100 fainter than the ASCA detection. We also made deep

Galactic diffuse gamma-rays come, predominantly, from pi^0->gamma gamma in the
sub-GeV to multi-GeV range. Hunter et al. found, however, an excess in the GeV
range (""GeV Excess"") in the EGRET Galactic diffuse spectrum above the
prediction based on experimental pp->pi^0 cross-sections and the Feynman
scaling hypothesis. We show, in this work, that the diffractive process makes
the gamma-ray spectrum harder than the incident proton spectrum by ~0.05 in
power-law index, and, that the scaling violation produces 30-80% more pi^0 than
the scaling model for incident proton energies above 100GeV. Combination of the
two can explain about a half of the ""GeV Excess"" with the local cosmic proton
(power-law index ~2.7). The excess can be fully explained if the proton
spectral index in the Galactic ridge is a little harder (~0.2 in power-law
index) than the local spectrum. Given also in the paper is that the diffractive
process enhances e^+ over e^- and the scaling violation gives 50-100% higher
p-bar yield than without the violation, both in the multi-GeV range.

function (PDF) and the one-dimensional power spectrum (PS) of the Lya forest
flux decrement. The sensitivity of these statistical measures to the shape and
amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum is investigated using two
variants of the LCDM cosmology. In the first model, the linear power spectrum
has a scale-invariant spectral index, whereas in the second, it has a negative
running index (RSI). We generate mock catalogs of QSO spectra, and compare
their statistical properties to those of the observations at z=3. We perform a
joint fit of the power spectrum and PDF. A scale-invariant model with
\sigma_8=0.9 matches well the data if the mean IGM temperature is T\leq 15000K.
For higher temperature, it tends to overestimate the flux power spectrum over
scales k < 0.01s/km. The discrepancy is less severe when the PS alone is
fitted. However, models matching the PS alone do not yield a good fit to the
PDF. A joint analysis of the flux PS and PDF tightens the constraints on the
model parameters and reduces systematic biases. The RSI model is consistent
with the observed PS and PDF only if the temperature is T\geq 20000K. The best
fit models reproduce the slope and normalisation of the column density
distribution, irrespective of the shape and amplitude of the linear power
spectrum. They are also consistent with the observed line-width distribution
given the large uncertainties. Our joint analysis suggests that \sigma_8 is
likely to be in the range 0.7 - 0.9 for a temperature 10000K<T<20000K and a
reasonable reionization history.

model, with an inner abundance of 1e-7 and an outer abundance lower than 1e-9

from the grains in theinner envelope. The deuteration ratio HDO/H2O is found to

  predominate?",,"J.Phys. G31 (2005) 255-264",,,"astro-ph",,"  We have argued [J. Szabelski et al. (2002)] that the well-known `ankle' in
the cosmic ray energy spectrum, at logE (eV) ~ 18.7-19.0, marks the transition
from mainly Galactic sources at lower energies to mainly extragalactic above.
Recently, however, there have been claims for lower transitional energies,
specifically from logE (eV) ~ 17.0 [G. Thompson et al. (2004)] via 17.2-17.8
[V.S. Berezinsky et al. (2004)] to 18.0 [A.M. Hillas (2004)]. In our model the
ankle arises naturally from the sum of simple power law-spectra with slopes
differing by ~ 1.8; from differential slope -3.8 for Galactic particles (near
logE = 19) to ~ -2.0 for extragalactic sources. In the other models, on the
other hand, the ankle is intrinsic to the extragalactic component alone, and
arises from the shape of the rate of energy loss versus energy for the
(assumed) protons interacting with the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
  Our detailed analysis of the world's data on the ultra-high energy spectrum
shows that taken together, or separately, the resulting mean sharpness of the
ankle (second difference of the log(intensity*E^3) with respect to logE) is
consistent with our `mixed' model. For explanation in terms of extragalactic
particles alone, however, the ankle will be at the wrong energy - for
reasonable production models and of insufficient magnitude if, as seems likely,
there is still a significant fraction of heavy nuclei at the ankle energy.

distortion parameter \beta(L*,0). The recovered marginalised band-powers are
compared to previous estimates of galaxy power spectra. Additionally, we
provide a simple model for the 17 dimensional likelihood hyper-surface in order
to allow the likelihood to be quickly estimated given a set of model
band-powers and \beta(L*,0). The likelihood surface is not well approximated by
a multi-variate Gaussian distribution with model-independent covariances.
Instead, a model is presented in which the distribution of each band-power has
a Gaussian distribution in a combination of the band-power and its logarithm.
The relative contribution of each component was determined by fitting the MCMC
output. Using these distributions, we demonstrate how the likelihood of a given
cosmological model can be quickly and accurately estimated, and use a simple
set of models to compare estimated likelihoods with likelihoods calculated
using the full Spherical Harmonics procedure. All of the data are made
publically available (from http://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/, enabling the Spherical
Harmonics decomposition of the 2dFGRS of Percival et al. (2004) to be easily
used as a cosmological constraint.

extended object. In the Robertson-Walker worldspace, this is seen to introduce
a pressureless density which could contribute to dark matter. Such pressureless
energy density, present from the very beginning, should have enormous
consequences on large scale structure formation in the early Universe.
Generalizing the idea to complexified internal co-ordinates, it becomes
possible to gauge the action with U(1) symmetry. A trivial solution of this
theory is Einstein's general relativity and source free Maxwell theory.
Generally, the equations of motion of the gauge fields are Maxwell equations
with source terms that include these fields themselves. The internal
co-ordinates, under vacuum domination with negative pressure, obey an EOM that
is a hyperbolic wave equation of a charged scalar field that interacts with the
gauge fields and gravity in a disperso-conductive medium ; under matter
domination with positive pressure however, it is an elliptic potential
equation. Since the hyperbolic to elliptic transition can be made by
introducing imaginary time, this result supports the view that time is actually
complex, becoming Minkowskian in vacuum and Euclidean in matter. A
supersymmetric version of the action can also be immediately written down.

on hypercubic lattices: either ergodicity at all densities or trivial
non-ergodicity, depending on the constraint parameter and the dimensionality.
But in the ergodic cases, the dynamics is shown to be intrinsically cooperative
at high densities giving rise to glassy dynamics as observed in simulations.
The cooperativity is characterized by two length scales whose behavior controls
finite-size effects: these are essential for interpreting simulations. In
contrast to hypercubic lattices, on Bethe lattices KA models undergo a
dynamical (jamming) phase transition at a critical density: this is
characterized by diverging time and length scales and a discontinuous jump in
the long-time limit of the density autocorrelation function. By analyzing
generalized Bethe lattices (with loops) that interpolate between hypercubic
lattices and standard Bethe lattices, the crossover between the dynamical
transition that exists on these lattices and its absence in the hypercubic
lattice limit is explored. Contact with earlier results are made via analysis
of the related Fredrickson-Andersen models, followed by brief discussions of
universality, of other approaches to glass transitions, and of some issues

fraction found using the plane wave and single particle bases. We show that the

to the case of the 'planar' phase, where the order parameter depends only on a
single spatial coordinate. We first show that, in the case of the simple
Fulde-Ferrell phase, singularities occur at zero temperature in the free energy
which prevents, at low temperature, a reliable use of an expansion in powers of
the order parameter. We then introduce in the quasiclassical equations a
Fourier expansion for the order parameter and the Green's functions, and we
show that it converges quite rapidly to the exact solution. We finally
implement numerically this method and find results in excellent agreement with
the earlier work of Matsuo \emph{et al}. In particular when the temperature is
lowered from the tricritical point, the transition switches from first to
second order. In the case of the first order transition, the spatial dependence
of the order parameter at the transition is found to be always very nearly a
pure cosine, although the maximum of its modulus may be comparable to the one

calculations can describe qualitatively the main features of the damping
observed over a range of lattice depths. We also derive a formula of the
fluctuation-dissipation type for the damping, based on a picture in which the
coherent motion of the condensate atoms is disrupted as they try to flow
through the random local potential created by the irregular motion of
noncondensate atoms. We expect this irregular motion to result from the
well-known dynamical instability exhibited by the mean-field theory for these
systems. When parameters for the characteristic strength and correlation times
of the fluctuations, obtained from the HFB calculations, are substituted in the
damping formula, we find very good agreement with the experimentally-observed
damping, as long as the lattice is shallow enough for the fraction of atoms in
the Mott insulator phase to be negligible. We also include, for completeness,
the results of other calculations based on the Gutzwiller ansatz, which appear

  Examples include object tracking in sensor networks, packet routing over the

  We propose a solution that takes advantage of the growing speed of local area

  Intrusion Detectors","Submit to journal for publication",,,"cais-tr-2004-001","cs.CR cs.AI",,"  Anomaly-based intrusion detection (AID) techniques are useful for detecting
novel intrusions into computing resources. One of the most successful AID
detectors proposed to date is stide, which is based on analysis of system call
sequences. In this paper, we present a detailed formal framework to analyze,
understand and improve the performance of stide and similar AID techniques.
Several important properties of stide-like detectors are established through
formal proofs, and validated by carefully conducted experiments using test
datasets. Finally, the framework is utilized to design two applications to
improve the cost and performance of stide-like detectors which are based on
sequence analysis. The first application reduces the cost of developing AID
detectors by identifying the critical sections in the training dataset, and the
second application identifies the intrusion context in the intrusive dataset,
that helps to fine-tune the detectors. Such fine-tuning in turn helps to
improve detection rate and reduce false alarm rate, thereby increasing the
effectiveness and efficiency of the intrusion detectors.

  2004, organized by the Santa Fe Institute (6 pages comprising 4 figures)",,,,"cs.GT cond-mat.stat-mech cs.NI",,"  The Internet is a loose amalgamation of independent service providers acting
in their own self-interest. We examine the implications of this economic
reality on peering relationships. Specifically, we consider how the incentives
of the providers might determine where they choose to interconnect with each
other. We consider a game where two selfish network providers must establish
peering points between their respective network graphs, given knowledge of
traffic conditions and a nearest-exit routing policy for out-going traffic, as
well as costs based on congestion and peering connectivity. We focus on the
pairwise stability equilibrium concept and use a stochastic procedure to solve
for the stochastically pairwise stable configurations. Stochastically stable
networks are selected for their robustness to deviations in strategy and are
therefore posited as the more likely networks to emerge in a dynamic setting.
We note a paucity of stochastically stable peering configurations under
asymmetric conditions, particularly to unequal interdomain traffic flow, with
adverse effects on system-wide efficiency. Under bilateral flow conditions, we
find that as the cost associated with the establishment of peering links
approaches zero, the variance in the number of peering links of stochastically
pairwise stable equilibria increases dramatically.

low-frequency (mHz) band, will fly in the next decade. In these detectors, the
spacecraft-to-spacecraft light-travel times will necessarily be unequal and
time-varying, and (because of aberration) will have different values on up- and
down-links. In such unequal-armlength interferometers, laser phase noise will
be canceled by taking linear combinations of the laser-phase observables
measured between pairs of spacecraft, appropriately time-shifted by the light
propagation times along the corresponding arms. This procedure, known as
time-delay interferometry (TDI), requires an accurate knowledge of the
light-time delays as functions of time. Here we propose a high-accuracy
technique to estimate these time delays and study its use in the context of the
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We refer to this ranging
technique, which relies on the TDI combinations themselves, as Time-Delay
Interferometric Ranging (TDIR). For every TDI combination, we show that, by
minimizing the rms power in that combination (averaged over integration times
$\sim 10^4$ s) with respect to the time-delay parameters, we obtain estimates
of the time delays accurate enough to cancel laser noise to a level well below
the secondary noises. Thus TDIR allows the implementation of TDI without the
use of dedicated inter-spacecraft ranging systems, with a potential
simplification of the LISA design. In this paper we define the TDIR procedure
formally, and we characterize its expected performance via simulations with the
\textit{Synthetic LISA} software package.

symmetries used are the well known automorphisms of the Lie algebra for the
corresponding isometry group of each Bianchi Type, as well as the scaling and
the time eparameterization symmetry. Application of the method to Type III
results in: a) the recovery of all known solutions without prior assumption of
any extra symmetry, b) the enclosure of the entire unknown part of the solution
space into a single, second order ODE in terms of one dependent variable and c)
a partial solution to this ODE. It is also worth-mentioning the fact that the
solution space is seen to be naturally partitioned into three distinct,
disconnected pieces: one consisting of the known Siklos (pp-wave) solution,
another occupied by the Type III member of the known Ellis-MacCallum family and
the third described by the aforementioned ODE in which an one parameter
subfamily of the known Kinnersley geometries resides. Lastly, preliminary
results reported show that the unknown part of the solution space for other
Bianchi Types is described by a strikingly similar ODE, pointing to a natural
operational unification as far as the problem of solving the cosmological EFE's

occurs in the continuum. This diagram gives a finite correction to the boson
2-point function that must be subtracted off in order to obtain the
perturbation series of the continuum theory, in the limit where the lattice
spacing $a$ vanishes. Using a transfer matrix approach, we provide a
nonperturbative proof that this counterterm suffices to yield the desired
continuum limit. This analysis also allows us to improve the action to O(a). We
demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulation that the spectrum of the continuum theory
is well-approximated at finite but small $a$, for both weak and strong
coupling. We contrast the above situation for the naive lattice action to what
occurs for the supersymmetric lattice action, which preserves a discrete
version of half the supersymmetry. There, cancellations between D=0 diagrams
occur, obviating the need for counterterms.

Sitter (AdS_5) bulk spacetime. In a brane-world scenario, the evolution of GWs
is affected by the non-standard cosmological expansion and the excitation of
the Kaluza-Klein modes (KK-modes), which are significant in the high-energy
regime of the universe. We numerically solve the wave equation of GWs in the
Poincare coordinates of the AdS_5 spacetime. Using a plausible initial
condition from inflation, we find that, while the behavior of GWs in the bulk
is sensitive to the transition time from inflation to the radiation dominated
epoch, the amplitude of GWs on the brane is insensitive to this time if the
transition occurs early enough before horizon re-entry. As a result, the
amplitude of GWs is suppressed by the excitation of KK-modes which escape from
the brane into the bulk, and the effect may compensate the enhancement of the
GWs by the non-standard cosmological expansion. Based on this, the influence of
the high-energy effects on the stochastic background of GWs is discussed.

computational fluid dynamics is presented. The method is based in reformulating
explicit schemes in matrix form, which cane modified gradually into semi or
strongly-implicit schemes. From the point of view of matrix-algebra, explicit
numerical methods are special cases in which the global matrix of coefficients
is reduced to the identity matrix $I$. This extreme simplification leads to
severer stability range, hence of their robustness. In this paper it is shown
that a condition, which is similar to the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL)
condition can be obtained from the stability requirement of inversion of the
coefficient matrix. This condition is shown to be relax-able, and that a class
of methods that range from explicit to strongly implicit methods can be
constructed, whose degree of implicitness depends on the number of coefficients
used in constructing the corresponding coefficient-matrices. Special attention
is given to a simple and tractable semi-explicit method, which is obtained by
modifying the coefficient matrix from the identity matrix $I$ into a
diagonal-matrix $D$. This method is shown to be stable, robust and it can be
applied to search for stationary solutions using large CFL-numbers, though it
converges slower than its implicit counterpart. Moreover, the method can be
applied to follow the evolution of strongly time-dependent flows, though it is
not as efficient as normal explicit methods. In addition, we find that the
residual smoothing method accelerates convergene toward steady state solutions
considerably and improves the efficiency of the solution procedure.

probability with which a node with degree $k$ is chosen is proportional to
$w(k)$, where $w$ is a fixed weight function. We prove that if $w$ fulfills
some asymptotic requirements then the degree sequence converges in probability,
we give the limit. In particular if $w$ is asymptotically linear then the

a multigrid method in combination with pseudo-compressibility and local time
stepping techniques. This algorithm is suitable for large-scale
three-dimensional numerical simulations, because (i) memory storage for any
additional matrix is not required and (ii) vectorization and parallelization
are straightforward. The present algorithm has been incorporated into a mantle
convection simulation program based on the finite-volume discretization in a
three-dimensional rectangular domain. Benchmark comparisons with previous two-
and three-dimensional calculations including the temperature- and/or
depth-dependent viscosity revealed that accurate results are successfully
reproduced even for the cases with viscosity variations of several orders of

can be significantly improved by increasing the pre- and post-smoothing
calculations during the multigrid operations, and the convergence can be
achieved for the global viscosity variations up to 1e10.

yield in light emitting polymers. We propose a theory of electron-hole
recombination via inter-molecular inter-conversion from inter-molecular weakly
bound polaron pairs (or charge-transfer excitons) to intra-molecular excitons.
This theory is applicable to parallel polymer chains. A crucial aspect of the
theory is that both the intra-molecular and inter-molecular excitons are
effective-particles, which are described by both a relative-particle
wavefunction and a center-of-mass wavefunction. This implies two electronic
selection rules. (1) The parity of the relative-particle wavefunction implies
that inter-conversion occurs from the even parity inter-molecular
charge-transfer excitons to the strongly bound intra-molecular excitons. (2)
The orthonormality of the center-of-mass wavefunctions ensures that
inter-conversion occurs from the charge-transfer excitons to the lowest branch
of the strongly bound exciton families, and not to higher lying members of
these families. The inter-conversion is then predominately a multi-phonon
process, determined by the Franck-Condon factors. These factors are
exponentially smaller for the triplet manifold than the singlet manifold
because of the large exchange energy.

neural activity is involved in some perceptual and cognitive processes, the
functional role of such coherent neuronal behavior is not well understood. As a

Using a simple network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, we study the
effects of synchronized incoming spikes on the functioning of two mechanisms

associative memory. We demonstrate that a pair of switches undergone by the
incoming spikes, from asynchronous to synchronous and then back to
asynchronous, triggers a transition of the network from one state to another
state. In the case of associative memory, for example, this switching controls
the timing of the next recalling, whereas the firing rate pattern in the
asynchronous state prepares the network for the next retrieval pattern.

(including the parameters $x$, $y$ and $z$) treated by M. V. Berry. This model
is different from usual non-commutative ones because the x-y coordinates are
quantized, while the z coordinate is not.
  One of new and interesting points in our non-commutative model is that the
strings corresponding to Dirac ones in the Berry model exist only in states
containing the ground state (${\cal F}\times \{\ket{0}\} \cup \{\ket{0}\}\times
{\cal F}$), while for other excited states (${\cal F}\times {\cal F} \setminus
{\cal F}\times \{\ket{0}\} \cup \{\ket{0}\}\times {\cal F}$) they don't exist.
  It is probable that a non-commutative model makes singular objects (singular
points or singular lines or etc) in the corresponding classical model mild or
removes them partly.

differing only on the scale smaller than Planck's cell correspond to the same
quantum system. This fact is used to find a unique semiclassical representation
without the Van Vleck determinant, applicable to a large class of correlation
functions expressible as quantum fidelity. As in the Feynman path integral
formulation of quantum mechanics, all contributing trajectories have the same
amplitude: that is why it is denoted the ``dephasing representation.'' By
relating the present approach to the problem of existence of true trajectories
near numerically-computed chaotic trajectories, the approximation is made
rigorous for any system in which the shadowing theorem holds. Numerical
implementation only requires computing actions along the unperturbed
trajectories and not finding the shadowing trajectories. While semiclassical
linear-response theory was used before in quasi-integrable and chaotic systems,
here its validity is justified in the most generic, mixed systems. Dephasing
representation appears to be a rare practical method to calculate quantum
correlation functions in nonuniversal regimes in many-dimensional systems where
exact quantum calculations are impossible.

In the first case the bath consists of a massless bosonic field with the bath
reference states being the squeezed vacuum states and squeezed thermal states
while in the second case a system consisting of a harmonic oscillator
interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators is analyzed with the bath being

A 72, 012328 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.012328",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  In this paper we present an approach to quantum cloning with unmodulated spin
networks. The cloner is realized by a proper design of the network and a choice
of the coupling between the qubits. We show that in the case of phase covariant
cloner the XY coupling gives the best results. In the 1->2 cloning we find that
the value for the fidelity of the optimal cloner is achieved, and values
comparable to the optimal ones in the general N->M case can be attained. If a
suitable set of network symmetries are satisfied, the output fidelity of the
clones does not depend on the specific choice of the graph. We show that spin
network cloning is robust against the presence of static imperfections.
Moreover, in the presence of noise, it outperforms the conventional approach.
In this case the fidelity exceeds the corresponding value obtained by quantum
gates even for a very small amount of noise. Furthermore we show how to use
this method to clone qutrits and qudits. By means of the Heisenberg coupling it
is also possible to implement the universal cloner although in this case the
fidelity is 10% off that of the optimal cloner.
