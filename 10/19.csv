the contaminating background of its host galaxy, and apply it to the specific
case of high-redshift Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) spectroscopy. The algorithm is
based on a two-channel iterative technique employing the Richardson-Lucy
restoration method and is implemented in the IRAF code 'specinholucy'. We run
the code both on simulated (SN Ia at z=0.5 embedded in a bright host galaxy)
and observed (SNe Ia at various phases up to z=0.236) data taken with VLT+FORS1
and show the advantages of using such a deconvolution technique in comparison
with less elaborate methods. This paper is motivated by the need for optimal
supernova spectroscopic data reduction in order to make meaningful comparisons
between the low and high-redshift SN Ia samples. This may reveal subtle
evolutionary and systematic effects that could depend on redshift and bias the
cosmological results derived from comparisons of local and high-z SNe Ia in
recent years. We describe the various aspects of the extraction in some detail
as guidelines for the first-time user and present an optimal observing strategy
for successful implementation of this method in future high-z SN Ia

Applying selection criteria to the wing features, we obtain a sample of HII

Deconvolution of a representative sample of the line profiles eliminates any

present an analysis of the high velocity low intensity features fitting them

dispersions for the red and blue features take similar values. We interpret the
features as signatures of expanding shells inside the HII regions. Up to a
shell radius of R(shell)~0.2R(reg), the stellar winds from the central ionizing

statistically constrained by the observed galaxies, based on the IRAS 1.2-Jy
all-sky redshift survey. As a result, prominent galaxy clusters in our
simulation coincide closely with their real counterparts. We find excellent
agreement between RMs of our simulated clusters and observational data. The
improved resolution compared to previous work also allows us to study the MF in
large-scale filaments, sheets and voids. By tracing the propagation of UHE
protons in the simulated MF we construct full-sky maps of expected deflection
angles of protons with arrival energies E=1e20eV and 4e19eV, respectively.
Strong deflections are only produced if UHE protons cross clusters, however
covering only a small area on the sky. Multiple crossings of sheets and
filaments over larger distances may give rise to noticeable deflections,
depending on the model adopted for the magnetic seed field. Based on our
results we argue that over a large fraction of the sky the deflections are
likely to remain smaller than the present experimental angular sensitivity.
Therefore, we conclude that forthcoming air shower experiments should be able
to locate sources of UHE protons and shed more light on the nature of
cosmological MFs.

explain a number of key properties of DNOs, including their frequency range,

treats the SL as a cavity containing shallow surface waves, each with the same

azimuthal wavenumber, $m$. The $m=0$ latitudinally propagating mode best
matches the periods and scalings associated with most DNOs, and DNOs with
periods shorter than the WD Keplerian period are explained by the $m=-1$
prograde mode. We also predict a third set of oscillations, produced by the

radio-loud (RL) AGNs extracted from the XBSS sample. The main goal is to study
the origin of the X-ray spectral differences usually observed between
radio-loud and radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs. To this end, a comparison sample of 53 RQ
AGNs has been also extracted from the same XBSS sample and studied together
with the sample of RL AGNs. We have focused the analysis on the distribution of
the X-ray spectral indices of the power-law component that models the large
majority of the spectra in both samples. We find that the mean X-ray energy
spectral index is very similar in the 2 samples and close to alpha_X~1.
However, the intrinsic distribution of the spectral indices is significantly
broader in the sample of RL AGNs. In order to investigate the origin of this
difference, we have divided the RL AGNs into blazars and ``non-blazars'', on
the basis of the available optical and radio information. We find strong
evidence that the broad distribution observed in the RL AGN sample is mainly
due to the presence of the blazars. Furthermore, within the blazar class we
have found a link between the X-ray spectral index and the value of the
radio-to-X-ray spectral index suggesting that the observed X-ray emission is
directly connected to the emission of the relativistic jet. This trend is not
observed among the ``non-blazars'' RL AGNs. This favours the hypothesis that,
in these latter sources, the X-ray emission is not significantly influenced by
the jet emission and it has probably an origin similar to the RQ AGNs. Overall,
the results presented here indicate that the observed distribution of the X-ray

analyses of high resolution optical VLT-UVES spectra using an extensive grid of

stellar evolution scenarios. By combining our results with those for the sdB
stars from SPY (Lisker et al. 2004) we discuss the implications for binary
population synthesis models of Han et al. (2003). Models with a low CEE
efficiency and a constant mass ratio distribution provide a reasonable
explanation of the observed properties of the SPY sample of sdB and sdO stars
indicating that the sdO stars form the hot and luminous extension of the sdB
sequence. However, for the He-sdO stars none of the considered evolution
scenarios are in agreement with the measured parameters of our programme stars.
We conclude that He-sdO stars are formed by a different process than the sdB

using near-infrared spectroscopic data, while for the remaining 5 EROs the

of an X-ray obscured QSO in at least 5 out of the 6 X-ray emitting EROs. For
these 5 objects we derive intrinsic (2-10 keV) luminosities in excess of 10^44
erg/s and intrinsic column densities higher than 10^22 cm^-2. These values have
been obtained through a basic X-ray spectral analysis for the three brightest
sources and through the analysis of the hardness ratios for the remaining two.
All of these 5 X-ray emitting EROs appear extended in the optical/near-infrared
bands indicating that the host galaxy emission dominates at these wavelengths.
This suggests that the hosted AGNs are likely to be absorbed also in the
optical/near-infrared bands: i.e. they are likely X-ray obscured possible type
2 QSOs. For the remaining ERO the presence of an AGN is suggested both by its
high 0.5-2 keV luminosity (L(0.5-2 keV)~10^43 erg/s) and by its
X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. In this case the quality of the present data
prevents us from placing firm constraints on the AGN type hosted. Finally, the
near-IR spectrum obtained for one of the 6 EROs classifies the host galaxy as
an elliptical at z~1.7 with a stellar mass well in excess of 10^11 M_\odot.
This result corroborates the possible link between the QSO activity and the
formation of massive spheroids.

pair-potential interactions which allows for the efficient simulation of
strained heteroepitaxial growth by means of kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
simulations. We discuss in detail the application of our model to the
simulation of three important strain relaxation mechanisms: First, the
formation of misfit dislocations in strained adsorbate films is investigated.
We find a power-law misfit dependence of the critical layer thickness, in
agreement with various experimental studies. Second, we study the
self-assembled island formation on a thin adsorbate wetting-layer
(Stranski-Krastanov growth). We show that an increased diffusion barrier on the
substrate is a possible kinetic reason for the formation of a stable
wetting-layer. The formation of islands can be ascribed to a partial relaxation
of adsorbate material which affects the diffusion barriers for adsorbate
particles. The dependence of island size and density on misfit, temperature and
particle flux is in good qualitative agreement with metal-organic vapor phase
epitaxy experiments. Finally, we consider surface alloying as strain relaxation
mechanism in multi-component systems. Equilibrium simulations show that the
competition between binding and strain energy yields regular stripe patterns.
Under non-equilibrium conditions we find pattern formation as well as the
experimentally observed island ramification. The comparison with a lattice gas
model shows that the stripe formation can solely be due to kinetic effects but
the misfit is essential for the ramification and stabilization of the surface
structures.

numerically determine that the probability distribution for a site to have $k$

universality class to which the Barabasi-Albert model belongs. In addition to
this, we have numerically studied the rate at which the average number of links
$<k_i>$ increases with the scaled time $t/i$; asymptotically, $<k_i > \propto

characteristic features of low-lying crystalline electric field (CEF) levels
and the conduction band. A mechanism for the small CEF splitting between a
singlet and a triplet is proposed as combination of the point-charge
interaction and hybridization of 4f with ligand p states. Provided 4f^3
configurations dominate over 4f^1 as intermediate states, p-f hybridization
favors the triplet, while point-charge interaction favors the singlet. For
realistic parameters for hybridization as well as 4f^1 and 4f^3 levels, these
singlet and triplet can form a nearly degenerate pseudo-quartet. It is found
that one of two spin 1/2 objects composing the pseudo-quartet has a
ferromagnetic exchange, while the other has an antiferromagnetic exchange with
conduction electrons. The magnitude of each effective exchange depends strongly
on a parameter characterizing the triplet wave function under the T_h symmetry.
It is argued that differences of this parameter among Pr skutterdudites are
responsible for the apparent diversity of their physical properties. Numerical
renormalization group is used to derive the renormalization flows going toward
singlet, doublet, triplet or quaret according to the CEF splitting and exchange
interactions.

jump in carrier density {\it inside} the metallic state is found. Clear,
co-incident, discontinuous changes in orbital occupations are observed, showing
that such a transition would involve strong, multi-orbital correlations. These
results call for studies on suitably intercalated $TiOCl$ that may induce
metallization and, possibly, unconventional superconductivity.

superconductors. An experimental demonstration is treated of the mechanism
proposed by Anderson whereby photons travelling inside the superconductor
become massive, when the U(1) gauge symmetry is broken in the superconductor to
which the photons are coupled. Using the Ferrell-Tinkham sumrule the photon
mass is shown to have a simple relation to the spectral weight of the
condensate. Various forms of Josephson plasmons can exist in single-layer, and
bi-layecuprates. In the bi-layer cuprates a transverse optical plasma mode can
be observed as a peak in the c-axis optical conductivity. This mode appears as
a consequence of the existence of two different intrinsic Josephson couplings
between the CuO2 layers. It is strongly related to a collective oscillation
corresponding to small fluctuations of the relative phases of the two
condensates, which has been predicted in 1966 by A.J. Leggett for
superconductors with two bands of charge carriers. A description is given of
optical data of the high Tc cuprates demonstrating the presence of these and
similar collective modes.

splits due to an internal field at the Co site. From analyses of the Co NQR

in the $ab$-plane. The magnitude of the internal field suggests that the

tetrahedral finite element meshes that computes the warping using the finite
element method itself. The algorithm takes as input a two- or three-dimensional
domain defined by a boundary mesh (segments in one dimension or triangles in
two dimensions) that has a volume mesh (triangles in two dimensions or
tetrahedra in three dimensions) in its interior. It also takes as input a
prescribed movement of the boundary mesh. It computes as output updated
positions of the vertices of the volume mesh. The first step of the algorithm
is to determine from the initial mesh a set of local weights for each interior
vertex that describes each interior vertex in terms of the positions of its
neighbors. These weights are computed using a finite element stiffness matrix.
After a boundary transformation is applied, a linear system of equations based
upon the weights is solved to determine the final positions of the interior
vertices. The FEMWARP algorithm has been considered in the previous literature
(e.g., in a 2001 paper by Baker). FEMWARP has been succesful in computing
deformed meshes for certain applications. However, sometimes FEMWARP reverses
elements; this is our main concern in this paper. We analyze the causes for
this undesirable behavior and propose several techniques to make the method
more robust against reversals. The most successful of the proposed methods
includes combining FEMWARP with an optimization-based untangler.

higher order corrections. Improved general expressions for the WKB scalar and

expressions for the perturbations, and find that the next-to-leading order

related pQCD analysis of distortion effects for jet production in

analysis we consider the Abelian problem of higher order Coulomb distortions of
the spectrum of lepton pairs produced in peripheral nuclear collisions. We
report an explicit calculation of the contribution to the lepton pair
production in the collision of two photons from one nucleus with two photons
from the other nucleus, $2\gamma + 2\gamma \to \m{l}^+\m{l}^-$. The dependence
of this amplitude on the transverse momenta has a highly nontrivial form the
origin of which can be traced to the mismatch of the conservation of the
Sudakov components for the momentum of leptons in the Coulomb field of the
oppositely moving nuclei.
  The result suggests that the familiar eikonalization of Coulomb distortions
breaks down for the oppositely moving Coulomb centers, which is bad news from
the point of view of extensions to the pQCD treatment of jet production in
nuclear collisions. On the other hand, we notice that the amplitude for the
$2\gamma + 2\gamma \to \m{l}^+\m{l}^-$ process has a logarithmic enhancement
for the lepton pairs with large transverse momentum, which is absent for
$n\gamma + m\gamma \to \m{l}^+\m{l}^-$ processes with $m,n > 2$.

with higher order terms which cannot be eikonalized.

  For a given set of data (M,g,K), with a three dimensional manifold M, its
Riemannian metric g, and the second fundamental form K in the surrounding four
dimensional Lorentz space time manifold, the equation we solve is H+P=const or
H-P=const. Here H is the mean curvature, and P = tr K is the 2-trace of K along
the solution surface. This is a degenerate elliptic equation for the position
of the surface. It prescribes the mean curvature anisotropically, since P

for the convergence of the J-flow to a critical metric. We use this result to
show that on manifolds with ample canonical bundle, the Mabuchi energy is
proper on all Kahler classes in an open neighborhood of the canonical class

required detector size and achievable analysis energy threshold. The ultimate
sensitivity to WIMP dark matter and the pp flux uncertainty are evaluated as a
function of detector size. The dependence on the neon scintillation and PMT

threshold, a pp flux uncertainty of ~1%, and limits on the spin-independent
WIMP-nucleon cross-section of ~10^{-46} cm^2 for a 100 GeV WIMP, using

the equation of state with the CEP on the basis of the universality hypothesis

consider the time evolution in the case with the CEP and discuss how the CEP
affects the final state observables, such as the correlation length,

argue that the anomalously low kinetic freezeout temperature at the BNL

temperature range from 0 to +50 oC and at the different signal wavelengths, the
temperature and cross section dependent gain characteristics with respect to
pump powers are also examined in detail for the both conditions. As a
consequence, the dependence of the performance of EDFAs on temperature for 980
nm pumping is weaker than that for 1470 nm pumping, not only at room
temperature but also at the temperature range of 0 to +50 oC. However, the
performance of EDFAs is more efficient at the pumping wavelength of 1470 nm
than that of 980 nm for a wide range of temperature and high-pump powers. The
results of this theoretical model are a good agreement with the experimental

(CR) model intended to describe an argon microwave (2.45 GHz) plasma at
atmospheric pressure. This model aims to investigate the influence of
dissociative recombination products on the Saha-Boltzmann plasma equilibrium.
The model is tested through comparison with experimental results obtained in an
argon plasma column generated by a traveling electromagnetic surface-wave,
which is suitable to perform a parametric investigation of the plasma. It is
shown that dissociative recombination predominantly populates the 4s levels and
the ground state. It is further observed that it strongly influences the
population of the levels, specially those of lower energy. However, the higher
levels (close to the ionization limit) appear to be in equilibrium whatever the
plasma density. This allows assuming that the excitation temperature Texc
determined from the upper levels in the atomic system in the Boltzmann-plot is
equal to Te.

advection to estimate the Lagrangian velocity correlation functions (LVCF)
associated with the midlatitude tropospheric flow. In particular we decompose
the velocity field into time mean and transient (or eddy) components to better
understand the nature of the LVCF's. A closely related quantity, the absolute
dispersion (AD) is also examined.
  Given the anisotropy of the flow, meridional and zonal characteristics are
considered separately. The zonal LVCF is seen to be non-exponential. In fact,
for intermediate timescales it can either be interpreted as a power law of the
form $\tau^{-\alpha}$ with $ 0<\alpha<1$ or as the sum of exponentials with
differing timescales - both interpretations being equivalent. More importantly
the long time correlations in the zonal flow result in a superdiffusive zonal
AD regime. On the other hand, the meridional LVCF decays rapidly to zero.
Before approaching zero the meridional LVCF shows a region of negative
correlation - a consequence of the presence of planetary scale Rossby waves. As
a result the meridional AD, apart from showing the classical asymptotic
ballistic and diffusive regimes, displays transient subdiffusive behaviour.

rotating magnetized plasma produced in a linear ECR plasma device named HYPER-I
at National Institute for Fusion Science. The vortex appears with a deep
density-cavity, plasma hole, in its center, and is identified as a dissipative
vortex in viscous fluids (Burgers vortex) [1]. The kinematic viscosity
estimated from the vorticity profile and the ion flow field is 4 orders of
magnitude higher than the classical value, which may be attributable to
insufficiency of the Debye shielding or the breaking of quasi-neutrality. Here
we present the results of potential measurements and the evaluation of
quasi-neutrality breaking. It is revealed that the potential has a bell-shaped
axisymmetric structure localized inside the core region, in which its maximum
value exceeds 5 Te. Using Poisson's equation, degree of quasi-neutrality
breaking is evaluated, which shows 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of
usual laboratory plasma. The strong electric field produced by this
quasi-neutrality breaking drives the supersonic rotation of the plasma hole. It
should be mentioned that the degree of quasi-neutrality breaking in the ambient
region of the plasma hole is comparable to that of usual laboratory plasma.
Hence the plasma hole can be considered as the structure of a nonneutral core
surrounded by a quasi-neutral plasma. It is of great interest to study the
fluctuations associated with the connected structure of the nonneutral and the
quasi-neutral plasma, especially the interfacial layer in between. Our
preliminary observation shows that the pronounced fluctuations exist in the

lattice solitons in Kerr-type cubic medium with harmonic transverse modulation
of refractive index. We discovered that unstable families of scalar lattice
solitons can be stabilized via the cross-phase modulation (XPM) in the vector
case. It was found that multi-humped vector solitons that are unstable in
uniform media where XPM strength is higher than that of self-phase modulation,
can also be stabilized by the lattice.

calculation of the drift instability growth rate. This method makes use of the
multipole approximation of the Z dispersion function, previously published, and
valid for the entire range. A careful analysis of the solutions spectra of this
kind of polynomial equation permits us to calculate easily the growth rate of
the drift instability for the ion-dust and dust acoustic mode. The value of the
parallel to magnetic field wavelength for which the instability reaches the
maximal value is carefully localized and discussed. The unstable dust-ion and
dust acoustic mode are discriminated and analyzed in function of the density
gradient, Te/Ti - ratio, and dust grain radius.

investigated for the boundary region of magnetized plasmas. We employ a
two-dimensional fluid model for the evolution of the global plasma quantities
in a geometry and with parameters relevant to the scrape-off layer of confined
toroidal plasmas. Strongly intermittent plasma transport is regulated by
self-consistently generated sheared poloidal flows and is mediated by bursty
ejection of particles and heat from the bulk plasma in the form of blobs.
Coarse grained probe signals reveal a highly skewed and flat distribution on
short time scales, but tends towards a normal distribution at large time
scales. Conditionally averaged signals are in perfect agreement with
experimental measurements.

angles. It is now well known that neurons are the seat of all activities of the
brain function. The dynamical properties pertaining to a single neuron and a
collection of neurons may be widely different owing to the clustering
properties of a group of neurons. As it can be clearly understood theory of
complex physical systems has been more and more employed to study the behaviour
of neurons and neuronal circuits. We here mainly discuss neural correlates of
memory and cognitive functions utilizing graph theory and ideas from geometry.
It has been suggested that stochastic processes being at the helm of affairs in
the neuronal level there may exist surfaces to some extent like a hologram for
the existence of memory functions.It is also instructive to mention that
Amari's developments \cite{amari} as regards information geometry has acted as
an important inspiration. Unlike some previous analysis categorization of
memory from neural perspectives have been reconsidered at the neuronal level.
In essence the main point of discussion here has been to give an alternative
model of memory where stochastic geometry and algebraic surfaces is an
important ingredient.

that we obtain have a Boltzmann-like shape, and their effective temperature
parameter, measuring the limit of divergent evolutionary changes at a given
site, can be predicted from a site-specific topological property, the principal
eigenvector of the contact matrix of the native conformation of the protein.
These analytic results, obtained without free parameters, are compared with
simulations of the SCN model and with the site-specific amino acid
distributions obtained from the Protein Data Bank. These results also provide
new insights into how the topology of a protein fold influences its
designability, i.e. the number of sequences compatible with that fold. The
dependence of the effective temperature on the principal eigenvector decreases
for longer proteins, a possible consequence of the fact that selection for
thermodynamic stability becomes weaker in this case.

by quantum fluctuations on two parallel birefringent plates with in plane
optical anisotropy, separated by either vacuum or a liquid (ethanol). The
torque is found to vary as $\sin(2\theta)$, where $\theta$ represents the angle
between the two optical axes, and its magnitude rapidly increases with
decreasing plate separation $d$. For a 40 $\mu$m diameter disk, made out of
either quartz or calcite, kept parallel to a Barium Titanate plate at $d\simeq
100$ nm, the maximum torque (at $\theta={\pi\over 4}$) is of the order of
$\simeq 10^{-19}$ N$\cdot$m. We propose an experiment to observe this torque
when the Barium Titanate plate is immersed in ethanol and the other
birefringent disk is placed on top of it. In this case the retarded van der
Waals (or Casimir-Lifshitz) force between the two birefringent slabs is
repulsive. The disk would float parallel to the plate at a distance where its
net weight is counterbalanced by the retarded van der Waals repulsion, free to
rotate in response to very small driving torques.

photon distributions and in this way achieve highly non-classical
sub-Poissonian states. Some limitations and applications of the method are

approach for constructing a two-logical-qubit decoherence-free subspace (DFS)
based on the fact that the three protons in a CH3 spin system can not be
resolved in one-dimension NMR spectroscopy, but to a certain extent, can be
distinguished by two-dimensional multiple-quantum NMR. We used four noisy
physical nuclear spins, including three protons and one carbon in the CH3 spin
system, to generate two decoherence-free logical quantum bits. It made full use
of the unaddressed spins which could not be used in one-dimensional spectrum.
Furthermore, we have experimentally demonstrated such an approach. Our
experimental results have shown that our DFS can protect against far more types
of decoherence than the one composed of four noisy physical qubits all with
different chemical shifts. More importantly, this idea may provide new insights
into extending qubit systems in the sense that it effectively utilizes the
magnetically equivalent nuclei.
