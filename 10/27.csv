ideal candidate in an evolution scheme for AGN (e.g. Fabian (1999); Page et al.

and formation of the central black hole. The overall photometry (from the radio
to the X-ray energy band) of this source is well reproduced by the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of NGC 6240, while it is incompatible with the
spectrum of a Type 1 QSO (3C273) or a starburst galaxy (Arp 220). Its sub-mm

predicted value for a Compton-thick AGN in which only 1% of the nuclear
emission emerges through scattering. Using the observed flux at 850 \mu m we
have derived a SFR=550--680 M$_odot/yr and an estimate of the dust mass,

equations are solved from the photosphere to 4 AU, and for wave periods ranging
from 3 seconds to 3 days. We derive a radially varying power spectrum of
kinetic and magnetic energy fluctuations for waves propagating in both
directions along a superradially expanding magnetic flux tube. This work
differs from previous models in 3 major ways. (1) In the chromosphere and low
corona, the successive merging of flux tubes on granular and supergranular
scales is described using a 2D magnetostatic model of a network element. Below
a critical merging height the waves are modeled as thin-tube kink modes, and we
assume that all of the kink-mode wave energy is transformed into volume-filling
Alfven waves above the merging height. (2) The frequency spectrum of horizontal
motions is specified only at the photosphere based on prior analyses of G-band
bright point kinematics. Everywhere else the amplitudes of outward and inward
propagating waves are computed with no free parameters. We find that the wave
amplitudes in the corona agree well with off-limb nonthermal line widths. (3)
Nonlinear turbulent damping is applied to the results of the linear model using
a phenomenological loss term. A single choice for the normalization of the
turbulent outer-scale length produces both the right amount of damping at large
distances (to agree with in situ measurements) and the right amount of heating
in the extended corona (to agree with empirical wind acceleration models). In
the corona, the modeled heating rate differs by more than an order of magnitude
from a rate based on isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence.

to be highly ionized, and may be identified with the shielding gas in the
disk-wind paradigm. Furthermore, we find evidence for a correlation of
alpha_uv, the ultraviolet spectral index, with the hardness of the X-ray
continuum; an analysis of independent Bright Quasar Survey data from the
literature supports this conclusion. This result points to intrinsically red
quasars having systematically flatter hard X-ray continua without evidence for

particular, Kanekar & Chengaulr (2003) have attributed the mix of 21-cm
detections and non-detections in low redshift (z<2.04) DLAs to a mix of spin
temperatures, while the non-detections at high redshift were attributed to high
spin temperatures. Below z=0.9, where some of the DLA host galaxy morphologies
are known, we find that 21-cm absorption is normally detected towards large
radio sources when the absorber is known to be associated with a large
intermediate (spiral) galaxy. Furthermore, at these redshifts, only one of the
six 21-cm non-detections has an optical identification and these DLAs tend to
lie along the sight-lines to the largest background radio continuum sources.
For these and many of the high redshift DLAs occulting large radio continua, we
therefore expect covering factors of less than the assumed/estimated value of
unity. This would have the effect of introducing a range of spin temperatures
considerably narrower than the current range of >9000 K, while still supporting
the hypothesis that the high redshift DLA sample comprises a larger proportion
of compact galaxies than the low redshift sample.

and nature of orbital-spin states of these Mott insulators have been
intensively studied. In this article, we review the studies on orbital physics
in the perovskite titanates. We focus on the following three topics: (1) the
origin and nature of the ferromagnetism as well as the orbital ordering in the
compounds with relatively small R ions such as GdTiO3 and YTiO3, (2) the origin
of the G-type antiferromagnetism and the orbital state in LaTiO3, and (3) the
orbital-spin structures in other AFM(G) compounds with relatively large R ions
(R=Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm). On the basis of these discussions, we discuss the whole
phase diagram together with mechanisms of the magnetic phase transition. We
also show that the Ti t2g degeneracy is inherently lifted in the titanates,
which allows the single-band descriptions of the ground-state and low-energy
electronic structures as a good starting point. Our analyses indicate that
these compounds offer touchstone materials described by the single-band Hubbard
model on the cubic lattice. From this insight, we also reanalyze the hole-doped
titanates. Experimentally revealed filling-dependent and bandwidth-dependent
properties and the critical behavior of the metal-insulator transitions are
discussed in the light of theories based on the single-band Hubbard models.

case of a tie the group adopts either one opinion with respective probabilities
k and (1-k). The value of k accounts for the average of individual biases
driven by the existence of heterogeneous believes within the corresponding
class. It may vary from class to class. The process leads to extremism with a
full polarization of each class along either one opinions. For homogeneous
classes the extremism can be along the initial minority making it dictatorial.
At contrast heterogeneous classes exhibit a more balanced dynamics which
results in a democratic extremism. Segregation among subclasses may produce a
coexistence of opinions at the class level thus averting global extremism. The
existence of contradictory public opinions in similar social-cultural
neighborhoods is given a new light.

promotional actions at retailers in the fast moving consumer goods market. The
underlying hypotheses for this work are that price promotions are more
effective when fewer than average competitors do a promotion, and that a
promotion strategy can be based on past sales data. The first assumption has
been checked by analysing 1467 promotional actions for three products on the
Dutch market (ketchup, mayonnaise and curry sauce) over a 120-week period, both
on an aggregated level and on retailer chain level.
  The second assumption was tested by analysing past sales data with the
Minority Game. This revealed that high or low competitor promotional pressure
for actual ketchup, mayonnaise, curry sauce and barbecue sauce markets is to
some extent predictable up to a forecast of some 10 weeks. Whereas a random
guess would be right 50% of the time, a single-agent game can predict the
market with a success rate of 56% for a 6 to 9 week forecast. This number is
the same for all four mentioned fast moving consumer markets. For a multi-agent
game a larger variability in the success rate is obtained, but predictability
can be as high as 65%.
  Contrary to expectation, the actual market does the opposite of what game
theory would predict. This points at a systematic oscillation in the market.
Even though this result is not fully understood, merely observing that this
trend is present in the data could lead to exploitable trading benefits. As a
check, random history strings were generated from which the statistical
variation in the game prediction was studied. This shows that the odds are
1:1,000,000 that the observed pattern in the market is based on coincidence.

range from a single Monte Carlo run at fixed temperature. This is achieved by
fixing $N$, the number of temporal divisions in the Trotter-Suzuki expansion of
WLQMC, and by changing $\epsilon$$=$$1/(N \kb T)$. In this work we apply this
strategy to construct a single histogram Monte Carlo method for a canonical
ensemble of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators and we explore its
accuracy limits. We obtain that fixing $N$ imposses a limit of minimal
temperature to the properly performance of the method, which is
$T_{min}$$=$$1.9(2)N^{-0.80(6)}$ in our example. This limit is a consequence of
the fact that the Trotter-Suzuki expansion fails for large $\epsilon$ values,
and, therefore, should be taken into account in all applications of this
histogram method for quantum systems.

$R_{ag}(t,s)=s^{-(1+a)}f(t/s)$, which is usually believed to hold in the aging
regime, is not obeyed. We analyse the data assuming the existence of a
correction to scaling. We find $a=0.273 \pm 0.006$, in agreement with previous
numerical results obtained from the zero field cooled magnetization. We
investigate in detail also the scaling function $f(t/s)$ and we compare the
results with the predictions of analytical theories. We make an ansatz for the
correction to scaling, deriving an analytical expression for $R_{ag}(t,s)$.
This gives a satisfactory qualitative agreement with the numerical data for
$R_{ag}(t,s)$ and for the integrated response functions. With the analytical
model we explore the overall behavior, extrapolating beyond the time regime
accessible with the simulations. We explain why the data for the zero field
cooled susceptibility are not too sensitive to the existence of the correction
to scaling in $R_{ag}(t,s)$, making this quantity the most convenient for the
study of the asymptotic scaling properties.

retarded field is singular on the world line, it can be unambiguously

that is responsible for the acceleration. I also describe the recent efforts,

for the two gauges while the wave-function renormalization function $Z(q)$ is
more strongly infrared suppressed in the Laplacian gauge than in the Landau
gauge on the finer lattice. For Laplacian gauge, it seems that the finite $a$
error is large on the coarse lattice which has a lattice spacing $a$ of about
0.124 fm.

arises naturally through the AdS/CFT correspondence from the assumption that
supersymmetry is dynamically broken at a scale about (10 - 100) TeV, and
present several fully realistic theories in this framework. In the minimal
model, the bulk SU(5) gauge group is broken at the Planck brane by boundary
conditions, while supersymmetry is broken at the TeV brane. The theory
preserves the successes of conventional supersymmetric unification, and yet
physics at accessible energies has a drastic departure from that of the
conventional scenario. There are also several variations of the minimal model
giving distinct phenomenologies. These theories can provide a basis for
phenomenological studies of dynamical supersymmetry breaking at low energies.

D71 (2005) 123513","10.1103/PhysRevD.71.123513",,"hep-ph astro-ph hep-th",,"  We obtain the equations of motion for cosmic strings in extensions of the 3+1
FRW model with extra dimensions. From these we derive a generalisation of the
Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model for cosmic string network evolution
which we apply, first, to a higher-dimensional isotropic $D+1$ FRW model and,
second, to a 3+1 FRW model with static flat extra dimensions. In the former
case the string network does not achieve a scaling regime because of the
diminishing rate of string intersections ($D>3$), but this can be avoided in
the latter case by considering compact, small extra dimensions, for which there
is a reduced but still appreciable string intercommuting probability. We note
that the velocity components lying in the three expanding dimensions are
Hubble-damped, whereas those in the static extra dimensions are only very
weakly damped. This leads to the pathological possibility, in principle, that
string motion in the three infinite dimensions can come to a halt preventing
the strings from intersecting, with the result that scaling is not achieved and
the strings irreversibly dominate the early universe. We note criteria by which
this can be avoided, notably if the spatial structure of the network becomes
essentially three-dimensional, as is expected for string networks produced in
brane inflation. Applying our model to a brane inflation setting, we find
scaling solutions in which the effective 3D string motion does not necessarily
stop, but it is slowed down because of the excitations trapped in the extra
dimensions. These effects are likely to influence cosmic string network
evolution for a long period after formation and we discuss their more general
implications.

superconducting analogy in which fermions coupled to gravitons are in an
unstable false vauum. The coupling of the fermions to gravitons and a screened
attractive interaction among pairs of fermions generates fermion condensates
with zero momentum and a phase transition induces a non-perturbative transition
to a true vacuum state. This produces a positive energy gap $\Delta$ in the
vacuum energy identified with $\sqrt{\Lambda}$, where $\Lambda$ is the
cosmological constant. In the strong coupling limit, a large cosmological
constant induces a period of inflation in the early universe, followed by a
weak coupling limit in which $\sqrt{\Lambda}$ vanishes exponentially fast as
the universe expands due to the dependence of the energy gap on the Fermi

gravitation with gauge fields; 2. the coupling between the daor field and other
fields and the origin of dark energy. After introducing the concept of ``daor
field"" and discussing the daor geometry, we indicate that the complex daor
field has two kinds of symmetry transformations. Hence the gravitation and
SU(1,3) gauge field are unified under the framework of the complex connection.
We propose a first-order nonlinear coupling equation of the daor field, which
includes the coupling between the daor field and SU(1,3) gauge field and the
coupling between the daor field and the curvature, and from which Einstein's
gravitational equation can be deduced. The cosmological observations imply that
dark energy cannot be zero, and which will dominate the doom of our Universe.
The real part of the daor field self-coupling equation can be regarded as
Einstein's equation endowed with the cosmological constant. It shows that dark
energy originates from the self-coupling of the space-time curvature, and the
energy-momentum tensor is proportional to the square of coupling constant
\lambda. The dark energy density given by our scenario is in agreement with
astronomical observations. Furthermore, the Newtonian gravitational constant G
and the coupling constant \epsilon of gauge field satisfy G=
\lambda^{2}\epsilon^{2}.

radiative MHD equation with the radiative transfer equation in higher
dimensions is possible. Using this approach, it is possible to follow the
evolution of strongly time-dependent flows with low/high accuracies and with
efficiency comparable to explicit methods, as well as searching
quasi-stationary solutions for highly viscous flows. In particular, it is shown
that the hierarchical approach is capable of modelling the formation of jets in

speeds provides an efficient tool for statistical speed analysis, as well as a
fast and accurate method for speed computation. A variational principle based
analysis is carried out on the ensemble of KPP speeds through spatially
stationary random shear flows inside infinite channel domains. In the regime of
small root mean square (rms) shear amplitude, the enhancement of the ensemble
averaged KPP front speeds is proved to obey the quadratic law under certain
shear moment conditions. Similarly, in the large rms amplitude regime, the
enhancement follows the linear law. In particular, both laws hold for the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in case of two dimensional channels. An asymptotic
ensemble averaged speed formula is derived in the small rms regime and is
explicit in case of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of the shear. Variational
principle based computation agrees with these analytical findings, and allows
further study on the speed enhancement distributions as well as the dependence

above threshold is analyzed in terms of amplitude equations suggested for a

Lengyel-Epstein model describing a chemical reaction showing Turing patterns,

specific pattern forming system. The nonlinear competition between stripe
patterns and distorted hexagons is explored and their range of existence,
stability and coexistence is determined. Whereas without modulations hexagonal
patterns are always preferred near onset of pattern formation, single mode
solutions (stripes) are favored close to threshold for modulation amplitudes
beyond some critical value. Hence distorted hexagons only occur in a finite
range of the control parameter and their interval of existence shrinks to zero
with increasing values of the modulation amplitude. Furthermore depending on
the modulation amplitude the transition between stripes and distorted hexagons
is either sub- or supercritical.

and number of particles in the system are kept fixed), canonical ensemble
(temperature and number of particles are kept fixed) or grand canonical
ensemble (fixed temperature and a variable number of particles but with an
assigned average). This paper deals with calculations with canonical ensembles.
A recursive relation developed recently allows calculations with arbitrary
precision for many nuclear problems. Calculations are done to study the nature
of phase transition in intermediate energy heavy ion collision, to study the
caloric curves for nuclei and to explore the possibility of negative specific
heat because of the finiteness of nuclear systems. The model can also be used
for detailed calculations of other observables not connected with phase
transitions, such as populations of selected isotopes in a heavy ion collision.
  The model also serves a pedagogical purpose. For the problems at hand, both
the canonical and grand canonical solutions are obtainable with arbitrary
accuracy hence we can compare the values of observables obtained from the
canonical calculations with those from the grand canonical. Sometimes, very
interesting discrepancies are found. To illustrate the predictive power of the
model, calculated observables are com$data from the central collisions of Sn
isotopes.

turbulence and turbulent transport, stability limits to the plasma pressure and
exhaust of power and particles. Improved understanding of the physical
processes occurring in tokamak plasmas give enhanced confidence in ITER
achieving its goals. In particular, progress has been made in research to raise
the performance of tokamaks, aimed to extend the discharge pulse length towards
steady-state operation (advanced scenarios). Advanced scenarios use a modified
current density profile, ranging from (i) plasmas that sustain a central region
with a flat current density profile (zero magnetic shear), capable of operating
stationary at high plasma pressure, to (ii) discharges with an off axis maximum
of the current density profile (reversed magnetic shear in the core), able to
form internal transport barriers, to increase the confinement of the plasma.
The physics of advanced tokamak discharges is described, together with an
overview of recent results from different tokamak experiments.
