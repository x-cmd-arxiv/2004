Background (CMB) temperature and polarization auto- and cross-power spectra,

power spectra, relating the observed pseudo-Cl's to the underlying all-sky
Cl's, and test the reconstruction on both full-sky and cut-sky simulated CMB
data sets. In particular we consider the reconstruction of the Cl from upcoming
ground-based polarization experiments covering areas of a few hundred sq.
degrees and find that the method is fast, unbiased and performs well over a
wide range of multipoles from l=2 to l=2500. We then calculate the full
covariance matrix between the modes of the pseudo-temperature and polarization
power spectra, assuming that the underlying CMB fields are Gaussian randomly
distributed. The complexity of the covariance matrix prohibits its rapid
calculation, required for parameter estimation. Hence we present an
approximation for the covariance matrix in terms of convolutions of the
underlying power spectra. The coupling matrices in these expressions can be
estimated by fitting to numerical simulations, circumventing direct and slow
calculation, and further, inaccurate analytic approximations. We show that
these coupling matrices are mostly independent of cosmology, and that the full
covariance matrix for all six pseudo-Cl power spectra can be quickly and
accurately calculated for any given cosmological model using this method. We
compare these semi-analytic covariance matrices against simulations and find
good agreement, the accuracy of which depends mainly on survey area and the
range of cosmological parameters considered.

contrast to young massive Galactic clusters with ages <100 Myr, the new cluster

solar masses. Unlike known old open clusters, this new cluster lies in the
inner Galaxy at R_{GC} ~ 6.1 kpc. We designate this object ``GLIMPSE-C01'' and

We also identify a region of star formation and fan-shaped outflows from young
stellar objects in the same field as the cluster. The cluster's passage through

universal low-energy properties that do not depend on the details of their

universal properties are familiar and depend only on the scattering length a.
In the 3-body sector for identical bosons, the universal properties include the
existence of a sequence of shallow 3-body bound states called ""Efimov states""
and log-periodic dependence of scattering observables on the energy and the
scattering length. The spectrum of Efimov states in the limit a -> +/- infinity
is characterized by an asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry that is the
signature of renormalization group flow to a limit cycle. In this review, we
present a thorough treatment of universality for the system of three identical
bosons and we summarize the universal information that is currently available
for other 3-body systems. Our basic tools are the hyperspherical formalism to
provide qualitative insights, Efimov's radial laws for deriving the constraints
from unitarity, and effective field theory for quantitative calculations. We
also discuss topics on the frontiers of universality, including its extension
to systems with four or more particles and the systematic calculation of
deviations from universality.

explained by the bilinear parameters $\xi_i$ inducing the neutrino-neutralino

corrections, only the quark-squark exchanging diagrams involving the order-one
trilinear couplings $\lambda'_{i23,i32}$ can generate the solar neutrino mass
and mixing if the scalar mass $m_S$ is not larger than $10^9$ GeV. This scheme
requires an unpleasant hierarchical structure of the couplings, e.g.,
$\lambda_{i23,i32}\sim 1$, $\lambda'_{i33} \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\xi_i

aiming to describe the characteristics of a magnetized chlorine high-density

magnetic field intensity is investigated. It is shown that the dissociation
degree and the relative weight of the various charged species is strongly
influenced by the magnetic field when the gas pressure is low enough. In
contrast, at higher pressure, the plasma is essentially composed of negative
ions, and molecular neutrals and ions, independently of the field intensity. It
is further demonstrated that diffusion needs to be considered in order to
correctly predict the plasma behavior.

  Nonideal Plasmas, 27.-29. September, Kiel, Germany",,,,"physics.plasm-ph hep-ph physics.acc-ph quant-ph",,"  The possibility to observe vacuum electron-positron pair creation due to a
powerful optical laser pulse is discussed. We employ a quantum kinetic
formulation of the problem with a source term describing the vacuum pair
production in a homogeneous electric field with arbitrary time dependence
(dynamical Schwinger mechanism). For a periodic field weak in comparison with
the critical value E_{cr}=m^2/|e|, the electron-positron plasma density changes
approximately periodically with twice the field frequency. Under these
conditions, the mean value $<n>$ for the density per period in the volume
lambda^3 is a more appropriate characteristic quantity than the residual
density n_r which is taken over an integer number of field periods and
calculated using the imaginary time method. The value <n> is proportional to
the squared field intensity and does not depend on the frequency. We show that
in terms of the parameter <n> an optical laser can be more effective than a
X-ray one. We expect that it is possible to observe the vacuum creation effect
not only by means of the planned X-ray free electron lasers but already at
present-day optical lasers.

requires longer pulse durations to maintain adiabaticity. Apart from the fact
that the mean-field approximation becomes questionable at low densities, we
point out that a low-density strategy with longer pulses has several problems.
It generally requires higher pulse energies, and increases radiative losses. We
also show that even within the approximations used in the Comment, their
example leads to no efficiency improvement compared to our high-density case.
In a more careful analysis including radiative losses neglected in the Comment,
the proposed strategy gives almost no conversion owing to the longer pulse
durations required.

Deuterium plasma of $~10^21 m^-3$ density is heated by a high power
relativistic electron beam (peak parameters are ~1 MeV, ~25 kA, ~8 $\mu$s, ~120
kJ). Magnetic system of the facility is a 12-meter-long axisymmetrical solenoid
with corrugated magnetic field, which consists of 55 cells with
$B_max/B_min$=4.8/3.2 T. Collective plasma heating by the electron beam results
in peak electron temperature ~2 keV. To this time the ions are also
collectively heated by gradients of electron pressure in the cells of the trap.
Ion temperature increases above 1 keV and confines at the high level for ~1 ms.
Dense hot plasma in GOL-3 trap emits D-D neutrons for ~1 ms. Details of
collective plasma heating by the beam in the corrugated magnetic field will be
presented in the paper. New physical mechanism of effective heating of plasma
ions, substantially dependent on the corrugation of the magnetic field, is
discussed. Experiments with complete multimirror configuration of the GOL-3
facility have shown the significant improvement of energy confinement time
comparing with simple solenoidal configuration. Axial currents, which exist in
the system, cause sheared helical structure of the magnetic field. The safety
factor q is shown to be below unity on the axis.

shown that the behavior of the transmission coefficient and of the tunneling
phase-time near a resonance is given by expressions with ""Breit-Wigner type""
denominators. By contrast, it is shown that, when the tunneling probability is
low (but not negligible), the non-resonant tunneling time depends on the
barrier width and on the distance between the barriers only in a very weak
(exponentially decreasing) way: This can imply in various cases, as well-known,
the highly Superluminal tunneling associated with the so-called ""generalized
Hartman Effect""; but we are now able to improve and modify the mathematical
description of such an effect, and to compare more in detail our results with
the experimental data for non-resonant tunneling of photons. Finally, as a
second example, the tunneling phase-time is calculated, and compared with the
available experimental results, in the case of the quantum-mechanical tunneling
of neutrons through two barrier-filters at the resonance energy of the set-up.
