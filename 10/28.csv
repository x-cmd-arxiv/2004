independent of mode of propagation, when distance between sources is less than
the propagation lengths, such as energy attenuation length or diffusion length
(for propagation in magnetic fields). The propagation features in this

factor, which weakly depends on the generation spectrum index $\gamma_g$. We
argue that from the above features the dip is the most model-independent one.
For the power-law generation spectrum with $\gamma_g=2.7$ the dip is very well
confirmed by the data of all existing detectors, which gives the strong
evidence for extragalactic protons propagating through CMB. We develop the AGN
model for origin of UHECR, which successfully explains the observed spectra up
to $1\times 10^{20}$ eV and transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic

events at $E \gsim 1\times 10^{20}$ eV needs another component, e.g. from
superheavy dark matter. In case of weak extragalactic magnetic fields this
model is consistent with small-angle clustering and observed correlation with
BL Lacs.

enrichment is consistent with the chemical rise in Galactic disk stars. It is
less dramatic than, but perhaps consistent with, the enrichment rate of
0.18--0.26+/-0.07 dex per redshift unit seen in Damped Ly alpha systems, and it
is much less than predicted by many cosmological evolution models. The
high-redshift galaxies observed to date are the most luminous examples from

Star formation in the first 1-2 Gyr appears sufficient to elevate ambient
metallicities to near or above the solar value, implying efficient production

order of magnitude higher than those from the most massive star forming regions

of the superbubble, on the other hand, is weak in molecular and free-free

that a strong starburst produced energetic explosions and resultant plasma and
superbubble expansions, and induced the present starburst regions traced by our

These results, therefore, provide the first clear evidence of self-induced

a self-consistent solution of the hydrodynamic equations. The models account
for iron-group line-blanketing and clumping, and compute the hydrodynamic
structure of a radiatively driven wind consistently with the non-LTE radiation
transport in the co-moving frame. We construct a self-consistent wind model
that reproduces all observed properties of an early-type WC star (WC5). We find
that the WR-type mass-loss is initiated at high optical depth by the so-called
`Hot Iron Bump' opacities (Fe IX-XVI). The acceleration of the outer wind
regions is performed by iron-group ions of lower excitation in combination with
C and O. Consequently, the wind structure shows two acceleration regions, one
close to the hydrostatic wind base in the optically thick part of the
atmosphere, and another farther out in the wind. In addition to the radiative
acceleration, the `Iron Bump' opacities are responsible for an intense heating
of deep atmospheric layers. We find that the observed narrow OVI-emissions in
the optical spectra of WC stars originate from this region. By their dependence
on the clumping factor we gain important information about the location where
the density inhomogeneities in WR-winds start to develop.

the normal-state dc conductivity close to T_c. This scaling relation is
examined within the context of a clean and dirty-limit BCS superconductor.
These limits are well established for an isotropic BCS gap 2\Delta and a
normal-state scattering rate 1/\tau; in the clean limit 1/\tau \ll 2\Delta, and
in the dirty limit 1/\tau > 2\Delta. The dirty limit may also be defined
operationally as the regime where \rho_s varies with 1/\tau. It is shown that
the scaling relation \rho_s \propto \sigma_{dc}T_c is the hallmark of a BCS
system in the dirty-limit. While the gap in the copper-oxide superconductors is
considered to be d-wave with nodes and a gap maximum \Delta_0, if 1/\tau >
2\Delta_0 then the dirty-limit case is preserved. The scaling relation implies
that the copper-oxide superconductors are likely to be in the dirty limit, and
that as a result the energy scale associated with the formation of the
condensate is scaling linearly with T_c. The a-b planes and the c axis also
follow the same scaling relation. It is observed that the scaling behavior for
the dirty limit and the Josephson effect (assuming a BCS formalism) are
essentially identical, suggesting that in some regime these two effects may be
viewed as equivalent. This raises the possibility that electronic
inhomogeneities in the copper-oxygen planes may play an important role in the

the crack patterns are the same and depend solely on the normal component of
the impact velocity. Analysing the pattern of breakage, amount of damage,

allocated data structures, as well as concurrent, distributed and mobile
computation. While researchers have identified many uses of spatial
conjunction, its precise expressive power compared to traditional logical
constructs was not previously known. In this paper we establish the expressive
power of spatial conjunction. We construct an embedding from first-order logic
with spatial conjunction into second-order logic, and more surprisingly, an
embedding from full second order logic into first-order logic with spatial
conjunction. These embeddings show that the satisfiability of formulas in
first-order logic with spatial conjunction is equivalent to the satisfiability
of formulas in second-order logic. These results explain the great expressive
power of spatial conjunction and can be used to show that adding unrestricted
spatial conjunction to a decidable logic leads to an undecidable logic. As one
example, we show that adding unrestricted spatial conjunction to two-variable
logic leads to undecidability. On the side of decidability, the embedding into
second-order logic immediately implies the decidability of first-order logic
with a form of spatial conjunction over trees. The embedding into spatial
conjunction also has useful consequences: because a restricted form of spatial
conjunction in two-variable logic preserves decidability, we obtain that a
correspondingly restricted form of second-order quantification in two-variable
logic is decidable. The resulting language generalizes the first-order theory
of boolean algebra over sets and is useful in reasoning about the contents of
data structures in object-oriented languages.

lattice-regularized theory. This line of research entered a qualitatively new
phase recently, wherein the space-time structure (at least for some quantities)
can be directly observed in configurations dominating the QCD path integral,
i.e. without any subjective processing of typical configurations. This approach
to QCD vacuum structure does not rely on any proposed picture of QCD vacuum but
rather attempts to characterize this structure in a model-independent manner,
so that a coherent physical picture of the vacuum can emerge when such unbiased
numerical information accumulates to a sufficient degree. An important part of
this program is to develop a set of suitable quantitative characteristics
describing the space-time structure in a meaningful and physically relevant
manner. One of the basic pertinent issues here is whether QCD vacuum dynamics
can be understood in terms of localized vacuum objects, or whether such objects
behave as inherently global entities. The first direct studies of vacuum
structure strongly support the latter. In this paper, we develop a formal
framework which allows to answer this question in a quantitative manner. We
discuss in detail how to apply this approach to Dirac eigenmodes and to basic
scalar and pseudoscalar composites of gauge fields (action density and
topological charge density). The approach is illustrated numerically on overlap
Dirac zeromodes and near-zeromodes. This illustrative data provides direct
quantitative evidence supporting our earlier arguments for the global nature of
QCD Dirac eigenmodes.

to high scales due to the requirement of calculable unification. In this note I
review the recently proposed `Fat Higgs' model which relaxes the requirement of
perturbativity. In this framework, an NMSSM-like trilinear coupling becomes
strong at some intermediate scale. The NMSSM Higgses are meson composites of an
asymptotically-free gauge theory. This allows us to raise the mass of the
Higgs, thus alleviating the MSSM of its fine tuning problem. Despite the strong
coupling at an intermediate scale, the UV completion allows us to maintain
gauge coupling unification.

explanation for the thermodynamic arrow of time, and discuss the underlying
assumptions and consequences of this view. In the absence of inflation, we
argue that systems coupled to gravity usually evolve asymptotically to the
vacuum, which is the only natural state in a thermodynamic sense. In the
presence of a small positive vacuum energy and an appropriate inflaton field,
the de Sitter vacuum is unstable to the spontaneous onset of inflation at a
higher energy scale. Starting from de Sitter, inflation can increase the total
entropy of the universe without bound, creating universes similar to ours in
the process. An important consequence of this picture is that inflation occurs
asymptotically both forwards and backwards in time, implying a universe that is
(statistically) time-symmetric on ultra-large scales.

indeterminacy, space, and time lead to the equations of special relativity and
quantum mechanics, providing their causal explanation and explicit unification.

of dynamic complexity. The same complex-dynamical process accounts for the
universal gravitation and general relativity. The electromagnetic, weak, and
strong types of interaction between particles also constitute integral,
dynamically unified parts of quantum beat processes inside elementary
particles. The classical, dynamically localised behaviour emerges in a closed
system as a higher complexity level corresponding to formation of elementary

single-stranded RNA viruses. Under physiological conditions of salinity and
acidity, virus capsid assembly requires the presence of genomic material that
is oppositely charged to the core proteins. In this paper we apply basic
polymer physics and statistical mechanics methods to the self-assembly of a
synthetic virus encapsidating generic polyelectrolyte molecules. We find that
(i) the mean concentration of the encapsidated polyelectrolyte material depends
on the surface charge density, the radius of the capsid, and the linear charge
density of the polymer but neither on the salt concentration or the Kuhn
length, (ii) the total charge of the capsid interior is equal but opposite to
that of the empty capsid, a form of charge reversal. Unlike natural viruses,
synthetic viruses are predicted not to be under an osmotic swelling pressure.
The design condition that self-assembly only produces filled capsids is shown
to coincide with the condition that the capsid surface charge exceeds the
desorption threshold of polymer surface adsorption. We compare our results with
studies on the self-assembly of both synthetic and natural viruses.
