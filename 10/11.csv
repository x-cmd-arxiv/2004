redshift, based on surface photometry of a sample of 16 high redshift (0.6 < z
< 1.0) disk galaxies from the GOODS HST/ACS data. The radial profiles are best
fit by a double exponential profile. This result agrees with the profile of
disks in local galaxies. The cosmological surface brightness dimming at this
redshift range only allows us to detect galaxies with spatially ``early''
truncation, R_br/h_in <= 3.5. Six galaxies show the radial double exponential
structure, with an average value of R_br/h_in ~ 1.8. Such ``early'' truncated
galaxies are missing in local samples so far. This result opens the ground for
observing directly disk evolution through the study of the truncation radius as
a function of redshift.

surrounding a classical T Tauri star in the nearby 10 Myr old TW Hya
association. The spectrum was taken with the HST-STIS CCD, providing resolution
R ~ 360 over the wavelength range 5250 - 10300 A. Spatially resolved
spectroscopy of circumstellar disks is difficult due to the high contrast ratio
between the bright star and faint disk. Our novel observations provide optical
spectra of scattered light from the disk between 40 AU and 155 AU from the
star. The scattered light has the same color as the star (gray scattering) at
all radii, except the innermost region. This likely indicates that the
scattering dust grains are larger than about 1 micron all the way out to large
radii. From the spectroscopic data, we also obtained radial profiles of the
integrated disk brightness at two position angles, over almost the same region
as previously observed in HST-WFPC2 and NICMOS coronagraphic images (35 AU to
173 AU from the star). The profiles have the same shape as the earlier ones,
but show a small azimuthal asymmetry in the disk not previously noted. Our STIS
broad-band coronagraphic images of TW Hya confirm the reality of this
asymmetry, and show that the disk surface brightness interior to 140 AU has a
sinusoidal dependence on azimuthal angle. The maximum brightness occurs at a
position angle of 233.6 +/- 5.7 degrees East of North. This might be caused by
the combination of forward-scattering and an increase in inclination in the
inner region of the disk, suggesting that the TW Hya disk has a warp like that
seen in the Beta Pictoris debris disk.

jets are typically associated with the accretion in standard T Tauri star
disks. In this paper we calculate the H$\alpha$ emission of internal working
surfaces produced by a radiative jet in a neutral and in a photoionized
environment as a function of the jet parameters (the ejection velocity $v_j$,
shock velocity $v_s$, mass loss rate ${\dot M}$ and radius $r_j$ of the jet)

expected for jets from BDs. Interestingly, we find that while the mass loss
rates associated with jets from BDs are found to be two orders of magnitude
lower than the mass loss rates associated with ``standard'' HH jets (from T
Tauri stars), their velocities are likely to be similar. Based on our
calculations, we discuss the conditions in which jets from BDs can be detected

the highest characteristic frequency found previously in a Seyfert galaxy. This
extends the measured M_BH-f_br values to lower M_BH than previous studies of
Seyfert galaxies, and is consistent with an inverse scaling of variability
frequency with black hole mass. The variations observed are among the most
violent seen in an AGN to date, with the fractional rms amplitude (F_var)
exceeding 100 per cent in the softest band. The amplitude of the variations
seems intrinsically higher in NGC 4395 than most other Seyferts, even after

Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., Buneman, Weibel and

for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using a 3-D
relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating into
an ambient plasma. We find small differences in the results for no ambient and
modest ambient magnetic fields. Simulations show that the Weibel instability
created in the collisionless shock front accelerates jet and ambient particles
both perpendicular and parallel to the jet propagation direction. The small
scale magnetic field structure generated by the Weibel instability is
appropriate to the generation of ``jitter'' radiation from deflected electrons
(positrons) as opposed to synchrotron radiation. The jitter radiation resulting
from small scale magnetic field structures may be important for understanding
the complex time structure and spectral evolution observed in gamma-ray bursts

reached a size of up to 220 jet radii, corresponding to a 100 kpc sized radio
galaxy. The simulations are ""bipolar"", involving both jets. These are injected
into a King type density profile with small stochastic density variations. The
back-reaction of the cocoons on the beams in the center produces armlength
asymmetries of a few percent, with the longer jets on the side with the higher
average density. Two distinguishable bow shock phases were observed: an inner
elliptical part, and a later cylindrical, cigar-like phase, which is known from
previous simulations. The sideways motion of the inner elliptical bow shock
part is shown to follow the law of motion for spherical blast waves also in the
late phase, where the aspect ratio is high, with good accuracy. X-ray emission
maps are calculated and the two bow shock phases are shown to appear as rings
and elongated or elliptical regions, depending on the viewing angle. Such
structures are observed in the X-ray data of several radio galaxies (e.g. in
Abell 2052 and Hercules A), the best example being Cygnus A. In this case, an
elliptical bow shock is infered from the observations, a jet power of 10^47

the simulation results and the comparison to the observations, the emission
line gas producing the alignment effect in radio galaxies at high redshift is
suggested to be cooled gas entrained over the cocoon boundary.

(nonabsorbing) process. Stationary properties of the latter correspond to those
at the absorbing-state phase transition in the former. Studying the absorbing
version of an extremal dynamics model allows to determine certain critical
exponents that are not otherwise accessible. In the case of the Bak-Sneppen
(BS) model, the absorbing version is closely related to the ""$f$-avalanche""

in spreading simulations to the ""BS branching process"" also studied by these

percolation universality class. We revisit the absorbing BS model, obtaining
refined estimates for the threshold and critical exponents in one dimension. We
also study an extremal version of the usual contact process, using mean-field
theory and simulation. The extremal condition slows the spread of activity and
modifies the critical behavior radically, defining an ``extremal directed

Asymmetric updating is a relevant perturbation for this class, even though it
is irrelevant for the corresponding nonextremal class.

we magnetize the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric in arbitrary spacetime

generalizes previous results by Ernst for the case n=4. The magnetic field
deforms the shape of the event horizon, but the total area (as a function of
the mass) and the thermodynamics remain unaffected. The amount of flux through
a one-dimensional loop on the horizon exhibits a maximum for a finite value of
the magnetic field strength, and decreases for larger values. In the
Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit, the magnetized black hole becomes an
impulsive gravitational wave propagating in the Melvin background. Furthermore,
we discuss possible applications of a similar Harrison transformation to
rotating black objects. This enables us to magnetize the Myers-Perry hole and
the (dipole) Emparan-Reall ring at least in the special case when the vector
potential is parallel to a nonrotating Killing field. In particular, dipole
rings may be held in equilibrium even when their spin vanishes, thus
demonstrating (infinite) non-uniqueness of magnetized static uncharged black
holes in five dimensions. Physical properties of such rings are discussed.

processes called ""Stochastic Loewner Evolution"" (SLE) and conformal field
theory (CFT).
  First some important results are recalled which we utilise in the sequel, in
particular the notion of conformal restriction and of the ""restrcition
martingale"", originally introduced in Conformal restriction (G.F. Lawler, et
al).
  Then an explicit construction of a link between SLE and the representation
theory of the Virasoro algebra is given. In particular, we interpret the Ward
identities in terms of the restriction property and the central charge in terms
of the density of Brownian bubbles. We then show that this interpretation
permits to relate the $\kappa$ of the stochastic process with the central
charge $c$ of the conformal field theory. This is achieved by a highest-weight
representation which is degenerate at level two, of the Virasoro algebra.
  Then we proceed by giving a derivation of the same relations, but from the
theoretical physics point of view. In particular, we explore the relation
between SLE and the geometry of the underlying moduli spaces.
  Finally we outline a general construction which allows to construct random
curves on arbitrary Riemann surfaces. The key to this is to consider the
canonical operator $\frac{\kappa}{2}L^2_{-1}-2L_{-2}$ in conjunction with a
boundary field that is a degenerate highest-weight field $\psi$ as the
generator of a diffusion on an appropriate moduli space.

  Cofoliations on stacks arise from flat connections on groupoids. Connections
on groupoids generalize connections on gerbes and bundles in a natural way. A
flat connection on a groupoid is an integrable distribution of the morphism
space compatible with the groupoid structure and complementary to both source
and target fibres. A cofoliation of a stack determines the flat groupoid up to
etale equivalence.

using dilute water dispersions of two different homogenous spherical particles,
polystyrene latexes and poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, with a simple
assumption that the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$ is in proportion to the static

assistance of the simulated data, the apparent hydrodynamic radius $R_{h,app}$

size obtained from averaging the term $\exp (-q^{2}D\tau) $ in the static size
distribution $G(R_{s}) $ with the weight $R_{s}^{6}P(q,R_{s}) $.

refraction or translation has an associated matrix and a succession of

paper describes a general method to find the matrix coefficients for
translation and surface refraction irrespective of the surface shape or the

experimentally demonstrate a protocol for such quantum memory based on atomic
ensembles. We demonstrate for the first time a recording of an externally
provided quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum memory with a fidelity
up to 70%, significantly higher than that for the classical recording. Quantum
storage of light is achieved in three steps: an interaction of light with
atoms, the subsequent measurement on the transmitted light, and the feedback
onto the atoms conditioned on the measurement result. Density of recorded
states 33% higher than that for the best classical recording of light on atoms
is achieved. A quantum memory lifetime of up to 4 msec is demonstrated.
