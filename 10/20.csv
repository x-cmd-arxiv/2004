Snapshot program designed to expand the sample of known gravitational lenses
amenable to detailed photometric, lensing, and dynamical studies. The lens is a
smooth elliptical galaxy at a redshift of z_l = 0.2046 +/- 0.0001 with a Sloan
r-band magnitude of 17.00 +/- 0.05 and a stellar velocity dispersion of 267 +/-
17 km s^-1, obtained from its SDSS spectrum. Multiple emission lines place the
quadruply-imaged source at a redshift of z_s = 0.4814 +/- 0.0001. The
best-fitting singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model gives an Einstein radius
b = 1.35"" +/- 0.05"" (or [4.9 +/- 0.2] h_65^-1 kpc), corresponding to a total
mass of (30.9 +/- 2.3) x 10^10 h_65^-1 M_sun within the critical curve. In
combination with HST photometry this gives a rest-frame B-band mass-to-light
ratio of (8.1 +/- 0.7) h_65 times solar within the same region. The lens model
predicts a luminosity-weighted stellar dispersion within the 3""-diameter SDSS
aperture of sigma_* ~= 270 km s^-1, in good agreement with the observed value.
Using the model to de-lens the four lensed images yields a source with a

exponential potentials for which exact solutions of the Einstein equations are

Hubble constant. To compare predictions of our models with observations we
concentrate on the following data: the power spectrum of the CMBR anisotropy as
measured by WMAP, the publicly available data on type Ia supernovae, and the
parameters of large scale structure determined by the 2-degree Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). We use the WMAP data on the age of the universe and
the Hubble constant to fix the free parameters in our models. We then show that
the predictions of our models are consistent with the observed positions and
relative heights of the first 3 peaks in the CMB power spectrum, with the
energy density of dark energy as deduced from observations of distant type Ia
supernovae, and with parameters of the large scale structure as determined by
2dFGRS, in particular with the average density of dark matter. Our models are
also consistent with the results of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
Moreover, we investigate the evolution of matter density perturbations in our
quintessential models, solve exactly the evolution equation for the density
perturbations, and obtain an analytical expression for the growth index $f$. We
verify that the approximate relation f ~ Omega_M^(alpha) also holds in our
models.

photometric measurements of the brightness of the individual components in four
bands allowed us to decompose the system spectral energy distribution (SED)
into the two separate component SEDs. The primary exhibits a strong infrared
excess which suggests the presence of circumstellar material, whereas the
companion can be modelled as a naked photosphere. The infrared excess of HK Ori
A was found to contribute around two thirds of the total emission from this
component, suggesting that accretion power contributes significantly to the
flux. Submillimetre constraints mean that the circumstellar disk cannot be
particularly massive, whilst the near-infrared data indicates a high accretion
rate. Either the disk lifetime is very short, or the disk must be seen in an

series of papers on this issue, we consider the quantification of such effects
in the initial conditions of such simulations. A general formalism developed in
[1] allows us to write down an exact expression for the power spectrum of the
point distributions generated by the standard algorithm for generating such
initial conditions. Expanded perturbatively in the amplitude of the input (i.e.
theoretical, continuum) power spectrum, we obtain at linear order the input
power spectrum, plus two terms which arise from discreteness and contribute at
large wavenumbers. For cosmological type power spectra, one obtains as
expected, the input spectrum for wavenumbers k smaller than that characteristic
of the discreteness. The comparison of real space correlation properties is
more subtle because the discreteness corrections are not as strongly localised
in real space. For cosmological type spectra the theoretical mass variance in
spheres and two point correlation function are well approximated {\it above} a
finite distance. For typical initial amplitudes this distance is a few times
the inter-particle distance, but it diverges as this amplitude (or,
equivalently, the initial red-shift of the cosmological simulation) goes to
zero, at fixed particle density. We discuss briefly the physical significance
of these discreteness terms in the initial conditions, in particular with
respect to the definition of the continuum limit of N-body simulations.

older than a few Gyr, the colors of the red giants map to an abundance
distribution with errors of order 0.1 dex in abundance. The radially sampled
abundance distributions are all about the same width, but show a mild abundance
gradient that flattens outside ~20 kpc. The various distributions were weighted
and summed with the aid of new surface brightness profile fits to obtain an
abundance distribution representative of the entirety of M31. M31 is a system
near chemical maturity. This ``observed closed box'' is compared to analytical
closed box models. M31 suffers from a lack of metal-poor stars and metal-rich
stars relative to the simplest closed-box model in the same way as the solar
neighborhood.Comparing to several simple chemical evolution models, neither
complete mixing of gas at all times nor zero mixing, inhomogeneous models give
the most convincing match to the data. As noted elsewhere, the outer disk of
M31 is a factor of ten more metal-rich than the Milky Way halo, ten times more
metal-rich than the dwarf spheroidals cospatial with it, and more metal-rich
than most of the globular clusters at the same galactocentric radius.
Difficulties of interpretation are greatly eased if we posit that the M31 disk
dominates over the halo at all radii out to 50 kpc. In fact, scaling from
current density models of the Milky Way, one should not expect to see halo
stars dominating over disk stars until beyond our 50 kpc limit. A corollary
conclusion is that most published studies of the M31 ""halo"" are actually

plenty of optical/UV photons. These seed photons are Compton up-scattered by
the hot electrons of the accretion flow to higher frequencies, some into the
X-ray band, potentially making the innermost accretion flow much brighter in
X-rays than usual. We propose to use coordinated near infra-red and X-ray
observations of close star passages to put constraints onto Sgr A* accretion
theories. The absence of a noticeable change in the steady emission of Sgr A*
as observed by Chandra in the year 2002, when the star named S2 passed through

remarkable that these variations are equal and opposite, matching the two jets

residuals found in fits to the kinematic model of SS433 reported in the

velocity variation in the X-ray ionized region found in the He II emission of
+-50 km/s on spatial scales of 2-3 arcsec. We believe that the putative black

game do not allow a firm conclusion to be made that the IMF varies
systematically with conditions. The IMF integrated over entire galaxies,
however, is another matter. Chemical and photometric properties of various
galaxies do hint at {galaxial IMFs} being steeper than the stellar IMF, as is
also deduced from direct star-count analysis in the MW. These results are
sensitive to the modelling of stellar populations and to corrections for
stellar evolution, and are thus also uncertain. However, by realising that
galaxies are made from dissolving star clusters, star clusters being viewed as
{the fundamental building blocks of galaxies}, the result is found that
galaxial IMFs must be significantly steeper than the stellar IMF, because the
former results from a folding of the latter with the star-cluster mass
function. Furthermore, this notion leads to the important insight that galaxial
IMFs must vary with galaxy mass, and that the galaxial IMF is a strongly
varying function of the star-formation history for galaxies that have assembled
only a small mass in stars. Cosmological implications of this are discussed.

circumstellar wind blown cavities surrounding the star, bordered by a thin,
dense, cold shell. When the star explodes as a core-collapse supernova (SN),
the resulting shock wave will interact with this modified medium around the
star, rather than the interstellar medium. In this work we first explore the
nature of the circumstellar medium around massive stars in various evolutionary
stages. This is followed by a study of the evolution of SNe within these
wind-blown bubbles. The evolution depends primarily on a single parameter
$\Lambda$, the ratio of the mass of the dense shell to that of the ejected
material. We investigate the evolution for different values of this parameter.
We also plot approximate X-ray surface brightness plots from the simulations.
Our results show that in many cases the SN remnant spends a significant amount
of time within the bubble. The low density within the bubble can delay the
onset of the Sedov stage, and may end up reducing the amount of time spent in
the Sedov stage. The complicated density profile within the bubble makes it
difficult to infer the mass-loss properties of the pre-SN star by studying the
evolution of the resulting supernova remnant.

multicolor coronagraphic images of the recently discovered edge-on debris disk
around the nearby ($\sim10$ pc) M dwarf AU Microscopii. The disk is seen
between $r = $0\farcs 75 -- 15'' (7.5 -- 150 AU) from the star. It has a thin
midplane with a projected full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) thickness of 2.5 --
3.5 AU within $r < 50$ AU of the star that increases to 6.5 -- 9 AU at $r \sim
75$ AU. The disk's radial brightness profile is generally flat for $r < 15$ AU,
then decreases gradually ($I \propto r^{-1.8}$) out to $r \approx 43$ AU,
beyond which it falls rapidly ($I \propto r^{-4.7}$). Within 50 AU the midplane
is straight and aligned with the star, and beyond that it deviates by
$\sim3^{\circ}$, resulting in a bowed appearance that was also seen in
ground-based images. Three-dimensional modelling of the disk shows that the
inner region ($r < 50$ AU) is inclined to the line-of-sight by $<1^{\circ}$ and
the outer disk by $\sim3^{\circ}$. The inclination of the outer disk and
moderate forward scattering ($g \approx 0.4$) can explain the apparent bow. The
intrinsic, deprojected FWHM thickness is 1.5 -- 10 AU, increasing with radius.
The models indicate that the disk is clear of dust within $\sim12$ AU of the
star, in general agreement with the previous prediction of 17 AU based on the
infrared spectral energy distribution. The disk is blue, being 60% brighter at
$B$ than $I$ relative to the star. One possible explanation for this is that
there is a surplus of very small grains compared to other imaged debris disks
that have more neutral or red colors. This may be due to the low radiation
pressure exerted by the late-type star. Observations at two epochs show that an
extended source seen along the midplane is a background galaxy.

companions around stars. The full characterisation of the companions (M-type
stars, brown dwarfs or exoplanets) requires high-resolution spectroscopy to
measure properly masses and radii. With the advent of massive variability
surveys over wide fields, the large number of possible candidates makes such a
full characterisation impractical for all of them. We explore here a fast
technique to pre-select the most promising candidates using either near-IR
photometry or low resolution spectroscopy. We develop a new method based on the
well-calibrated surface brightness relation along with the correlation between
mass and luminosity for main sequence stars, so that not only giant stars can
be excluded but also accurate effective temperatures and radii can be measured.
The main source of uncertainty arises from the unknown dispersion of extinction
at a given distance. We apply this technique to our observations of a sample of
34 stars extracted from the 62 low-depth transits identified by OGLE during
their survey of some 10e5 stars stars in the Carina fields of the Galactic
disc. We infer that at least 78% of the companions of the stars which are well
characterised in this sample are not exoplanets. Stars OGLE-TR-105, OGLE-TR-109

the efficiency of our method in pre-selecting reliable planetary transit

found that these offsets show a linear dependence on the angular rotation
velocity of gas (Omega_G). This linear relation can be expressed by an
equation: theta =(Omega_G - Omega_P) * t_{H-alpha}, where Omega_P and
t_{H-alpha} are constant. Here, Omega_P corresponds to the pattern speed of
spiral arms and t_{H-alpha} is interpreted as the timescale between the peak
compression of the molecular gas in spiral arms and the peak of massive star
formation. We may thus determine Omega_P and t_{H-alpha} simultaneously by
fitting a line to our theta - Omega_G plot, if we assumed they are constant.
  From our plot, we obtained t_{H-alpha} =4.8 (+/- 1.2) Myr and Omega_P = 26
(+10/-6) km/s/kpc, which are consistent with previous studies. We suggest that
this theta - Omega_G plot can be a new tool to determine the pattern speed and
the typical timescale needed for star formations.

analysis is based on both the `classical' one-dimensional (1D) stellar
atmosphere models and on the new generation of three-dimensional (3D)
hydrodynamical models. We find that the non-LTE effects on the iron abundance
derived from Fe {\sc i} lines are very important, amounting to ${\sim}0.9$ dex
and to ${\sim}0.6$ dex in the 3D and 1D cases, respectively. On the other hand,
we find that non-LTE and 3D effects have to be taken into account for a
reliable determination of the iron abundance from weak Fe {\sc ii} lines,
because the significant overexcitation of their upper levels in the granular
regions tend to produce emission features. As a result such Fe {\sc ii} lines
are weaker than in LTE and the abundance correction amounts to ${\sim}0.4$ dex
for the 3D case. We derive also the oxygen-to-iron abundance ratio in the
metal-poor star HD140283 by using the O {\sc i} triplet at 7772--5 \AA and the
forbidden [O {\sc i}] line at 6300 \AA. Interestingly, when both non-LTE and 3D
effects are taken into account there still remains significant discrepancies in
the iron abundances derived from Fe {\sc i} and Fe {\sc ii} lines, as well as
in the oxygen abundances inferred from the O {\sc i} and [O {\sc i}] lines. We
conclude that the metalicity of this type of metal-poor stars could be
significantly larger than previously thought, which may have far-reaching
implications in stellar astrophysics.

also demonstrating their limitations. Although exact at infinite and accurate
around the equilibrium bond length, the RPA dissociation curve displays
unphysical repulsion at larger but finite bond lengths. Going beyond the RPA by
including the exact exchange kernel (RPA+X), we find a similar repulsion. We
argue that this deficiency is due to the absence of double excitations in

thermal conductivity results, for thinking that narrow channels through films
of oxidised atatic polypropylene (OAPP) are superconducting at room
temperature. It is thought that the conducting channels, with diameters less
than or of the order of a micrometre, are composed of smaller nanofilaments,
with diameters of the order of a nanometre. In the present paper a possible
explanation is given of measurements which show that the average resistance of
non-superconducting channels through films increases with film thickness more
slowly than linearly. This result is interpreted in terms of how the Bose
condensation temperatures of bosons in arrays of nanofilaments depend on the
length and numbers of filaments, and examples are given of parameters of the
arrays which could explain the data. The dispersion for the bosons is assumed
to consist of a sum of linear and quadratic terms, which is an approximate type
of dispersion reported for Cooper pairs. In order to fit the data with the
model used, it is necessary to suppose that values of superconducting Tc for
channels composed of large numbers of filaments are only slightly above room
temperature. It is argued that larger Tc's reported in 1989 when currents of
0.5 A are passed through channels may arise because (a) currents concentrate in
a subchannel of smaller width than the original channel, and (b)
current-current interactions draw the filaments of the subchannel sufficiently
close together to increase the transverse bandwidth and Tc in the model by the
required amount.

show experimentally that the interband optical absorption to the lower Zeeman

blockade of the optical transition. At high magnetic fields the optical
absorption to the upper Zeeman branch dominates the absorption spectrum. We
find however that the spin blockade is not complete and a 10% leakage remains
at high magnetic fields. Applying a gate voltage to empty the dot of its
resident electron turns off the spin blockade. This effect is observed at 1.5 K
and up to 9 Tesla.

truth-membership function $T$ which keeps track of the extent to which we
believe the tuple is in the relation, another is called false-membership
function which keeps track of the extent to which we believe that it is not in
the relation. A paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relation is inconsistent if
there exists one tuple $a$ such that $T(a) + F(a) > 1$. In order to handle
inconsistent situation, we propose an operator called split to transform
inconsistent paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relations into
pseudo-consistent paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relations and do the
set-theoretic and relation-theoretic operations on them and finally use another
operator called combine to transform the result back to paraconsistent

acting on the universal cover $\tilde{M}$. ($\pi_1(M)$, $\tilde{M}$) are known
to be the binary icosahedral group ${\cal H}_3$ and the sphere $S^3$
respectively.
  Taking $S^3$ as the group manifold $SU(2,C)$ it is shown that
$deck(\tilde{M}) \sim {\cal H}^r_3$ acts on $SU(2,C)$ by right multiplication.
A semidirect product group is constructed from ${\cal H}^r_3$ as normal
subgroup and from a second group ${\cal H}^c_3$ which provides the icosahedral
symmetries of $M$. Based on F. Klein's fundamental icosahedral ${\cal
H}_3$-invariant, we construct a novel hermitian ${\cal H}_3$-invariant

eigenvalues $\kappa$ quantize a complete orthogonal basis on Poincar\'{e}'s

partners of Klein's invariant polynomial. The analysis has applications in
cosmic topology \cite{LA},\cite{LE}. If the Poincar\'{e} 3-manifold $M$ is
assumed to model the space part of a cosmos, the observed temperature

studied in a projection formalism. In this setting the four dimensional
Einstein equations are equivalent to a three dimensional gravitational theory
with a $SL(2,\mathbb{C})/SO(1,1)$ sigma model as the material source. The sigma
model is determined by a complex Ernst equation. 2+1 decompositions of the
3-metric are used to establish the field equations on the orbit space of the
Killing vector. The two Killing horizons of spherical topology which
characterize the black holes, the cylinder of light where the Killing vector
changes from timelike to spacelike, and infinity are singular points of the
equations. The horizon and the light cylinder are shown to be regular
singularities, i.e. the metric functions can be expanded in a formal power
series in the vicinity. The behavior of the metric at spatial infinity is
studied in terms of formal series solutions to the linearized Einstein
equations. It is shown that the spacetime is not asymptotically flat in the
strong sense to have a smooth null infinity under the assumption that the
metric tends asymptotically to the Minkowski metric. In this case the metric
functions have an oscillatory behavior in the radial coordinate in a
non-axisymmetric setting, the asymptotic multipoles are not defined. The
asymptotic behavior of the Weyl tensor near infinity shows that there is no
smooth null infinity.

nearly half a century of its age, it continues to attract renewed interests of
not only theorists but also experimentalists when we now face such issues like
the accelerating universe and possible time-variability of the fine-structure
constant, both viewed as something beyond the standard GR. It appears that the
theory provides realistic results sometimes even beyond what is expected from
the quintessence approach aimed primarily to be more phenomenological. It seems
nevertheless as if some of the unique aspects of this theory are not fully
understood, even leading to occasional confusions. I try in my lectures, partly
using the contents of our book (Y.F. and K. Maeda, Scalar-tensor theory of
gravitation, Cambridge University Press, 2003), to discuss some of the most
crucial concepts starting from elementary introduction to the theory.
Particular emphases will be placed on the unique features of the nonminimal
coupling term, the roles of the conformal transformations together with the
choice of a physical conformal frame and the value of the coupling strength to
the matter. Readers are advised to refer to the references for more details.

for constraint violation is intrinsic. It is already present in the initial
value problem, i.e. even when no boundary conditions have to be specified. Its
origin is due to the instability of the constraint surface in the phase space
of initial conditions for the time evolution equations. In this paper, we
present a technique to study in detail how this instability depends on gauge

our model the axion can be a cold dark matter candidate, and the intermediate

state occurs at energies below the critical value E_c, which is slightly higher
than the barrier height. Tunneling probability grows with energy in this
regime. Above the critical energy, the tunneling mechanism is different. The
transition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the
potential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay. At certain limiting
energy E_l tunneling probability ceases to grow. At higher energies the
dominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by
the emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy
E=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration. The latter belongs to a
class of ``real--time instantons'', semiclassical solutions saturating the
inclusive probability of tunneling from initial states with given number of

automorphisms of this algebra and are not symmetries of quantum physics. Still,
when there are spectral degeneracies of a time-independent Hamiltonian on a
commutative space-time which are due to symmetries, they persist when
$\theta_{0i}\neqq 0$; they do not depend at all on $\theta_{0i}$. They give no
clue about rotation and parity violation when $\theta_{0i}\neqq 0$. The
persistence of degeneracies for $\theta_{0i}\neqq 0$ can be understood in terms
of invariance under deformed noncommutative ``rotations'' and ``parity''. They
are not spatial rotations and reflection. We explain such deformed symmetries.
We emphasize the significance of time-dependent perturbations (for example, due
to time-dependent electromagnetic fields) to observe noncommutativity. The
formalism for treating transition processes is illustrated by the example of
nonrelativistic hydrogen atom interacting with quantized electromagnetic field.
In the tree approximation, the $2s\to 1s +\gamma$ transition for hydrogen is

distance $D_t$ from $f(Z_0)$ to $f(Z_t)$ satisfies $\E(D_t^2) \le K^2 t

only Hilbert space (and its bi-Lipschitz equivalents) were known to have Markov
type 2. We show that every Banach space with modulus of smoothness of power
type 2 (in particular, $L_p$ for $p>2$) has Markov type 2; this proves a
conjecture of Ball. We also show that trees, hyperbolic groups and simply
connected Riemannian manifolds of pinched negative curvature have Markov type
2. Our results are applied to settle several conjectures on Lipschitz
extensions and embeddings. In particular, we answer a question posed by Johnson

mapping from a subset of $L_p$ to $L_q$ has a Lipschitz extension defined on

chains, which consist of one-dimensional networks of nonlinear oscillators in
an anharmonic on-site potential, linearly coupled to their nearest neighbors.
Travelling breathers are spatially localized solutions having the property of
being exactly translated by $p$ sites along the chain after a fixed propagation
time $T$ (these solutions generalize the concept of solitary waves for which
$p=1$). In the case of even on-site potentials, the existence of small
amplitude travelling breathers superposed on a small oscillatory tail has been
proved recently (G. James and Y. Sire, to appear in {\sl Comm. Math. Phys.},

oscillation size. In this paper we compute these solutions numerically and
continue them into the large amplitude regime for different types of even
potentials. We find that Klein-Gordon chains can support highly localized
travelling breather solutions superposed on an oscillatory tail. We provide
examples where the tail can be made very small and is difficult to detect at
the scale of central oscillations. In addition we numerically observe the

smoothing procedure in fluid dynamics which filters velocity fields locally
while leaving their associated vorticities unsmoothed, and has proved useful
for high Reynolds number turbulence computations. We consider several known
effects (selective decay, dynamic alignment, inverse cascades, and the
probability distribution functions of fluctuating turbulent quantities) in
magnetofluid turbulence and compare the results of numerical solutions of the
primitive MHD equations with their alpha-model counterparts' performance for
the same flows, in regimes where available resolution is adequate to explore
both. The hope is to justify the use of the alpha model in regimes that lie
outside currently available resolution, as will be the case in particular in
three-dimensional geometry or for magnetic Prandtl numbers differing

simulations with a standard and fully parallelized pseudo-spectral method and
periodic boundary conditions in two space dimensions, on the role that such a
modeling of the small scales using the Lagrangian-averaged framework plays in
the large-scale dynamics of MHD turbulence. Several flows are examined, and for

(DWT) are used to extract and study the dynamics of coherent structures in a
turbulent rotating fluid. Three-dimensional (3D) turbulence is generated by
strong pumping through tubes at the bottom of a rotating tank (48.4 cm high,
39.4 cm diameter). This flow evolves toward two-dimensional (2D) turbulence
with increasing height in the tank. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
measurements on the quasi-2D flow reveal many long-lived coherent vortices with
a wide range of sizes. The vorticity fields exhibit vortex birth, merger,
scattering, and destruction. We separate the flow into a low-entropy
``coherent'' and a high-entropy ``incoherent'' component by thresholding the
coefficients of the DWPT and DWT of the vorticity fields. Similar thresholdings
using the Fourier transform and JPEG compression together with the Okubo-Weiss
criterion are also tested for comparison. We find that the DWPT and DWT yield
similar results and are much more efficient at representing the total flow than
a Fourier-based method. Only about 3% of the large-amplitude coefficients of
the DWPT and DWT are necessary to represent the coherent component and preserve
the vorticity probability density function, transport properties, and spatial
and temporal correlations. The remaining small amplitude coefficients represent
the incoherent component, which has near Gaussian vorticity PDF, contains no
coherent structures, rapidly loses correlation in time, and does not contribute
significantly to the transport properties of the flow. This suggests that one
can describe and simulate such turbulent flow using a relatively small number
of wavelet or wavelet packet modes.

magnetic field diffusion into the plasma cloud, two orders of magnitude faster
than classical, which is one important aspect of the plasma cloud penetration
mechanism. Without such fast magnetic diffusion, clouds with kinetic beta below
unity would not be able to penetrate magnetic barriers at all. Tailor-made
diagnostics has been used for measurements in the parameter range with the
kinetic beta ? 0.5 to 10, and with normalized width w/r(gi) of the order of
unity. Experimental data on hf fluctuations in density and in electric field
has been combined to yield the effective anomalous transverse resistivity
eta(EFF). It is concluded that they are both dominated by highly nonlinear
oscillations in the lower hybrid range, driven by a strong diamagnetic current
loop that is set up in the plasma in the penetration process. The anomalous
magnetic diffusion rate, calculated from the resistivity eta(EFF), is
consistent with single-shot multi-probe array measurements of the diamagnetic
cavity and the associated quasi-dc electric structure. An interpretation of the
instability measurements in terms of the resistive term in the generalized (low
frequency) Ohm's law is given.

it is been developed by space agencies, space research institutes and
industries in several countries such as France, USA, Israel, Russian Federation

Hall Thruster designed with an innovative concept which uses an array of
permanent magnets, instead of an eletromagnet, to produce a radial magnetic
field inside its cylindrical plasma drift channel. Within this new concept, we
expect to develop a Hall Thruster within power consuption that will scale up to
small and medium size satellites. A plasma density and temperature space
profiles inside and outside the thruster channel will be shown. Space plasma
potential, ion temperature measurements based on doppler broadenning of
spectral lines and ion energy measurements are shown for different plasma
production regimes. Experimentaly measured propulsion and power consumption
will also be shown and compared with computational simulation models using the
same plasma experimental conditions. In both cases the results are showing a
thrust range between 40mN to 80mN which is close to the thrust levels obtained
with a commercial SPT 100 using 30% less electrical power.

other parameter regimes. It is concluded for what parameters a plasmoid should
be expected to penetrate the magnetic barrier through self-polarization,
penetrate through magnetic expulsion, or be rejected from the barrier. The
scaling parameters are n(e), v(0), B(perp), m(i), T(i), and the width w of the

large amplitude, ion density holes (cavitons) form. The interaction between
these cavitons and other incoming Langmuir waves gives rise to substantial
local acceleration of groups of electrons, and fine jet-like structures arise
in electron phase space. We show that these jets are caused by wave-breaking
when finite amplitude Langmuir waves experience the ion density gradient at the
leading edge of the holes, and are not caused by caviton burn-out. An
analytical two-fluid model gives the critical density gradient and caviton
depth for which this process can occur. In particular, the density gradient
critically affects the rate at which a Langmuir wave, moving into the caviton,
undergoes Landau damping. This treatment also enables us to derive analytical
estimates for the maximum energy of accelerated electrons, and for the energy
spectrum along a phase-space jet. These are confirmed by direct numerical
simulations.

tokamak physics. The ion effective charge Zeff provides a measure for impurity
concentration. On the TEXTOR tokamak (Julich, Germany), we run a diagnostic to
determine Zeff from the bremsstrahlung emissivity E. From radial profiles of E,
electron density ne and temperature Te, profiles for Zeff can be reconstructed.
However, their interpretation is difficult outside the plasma centre, because
of various uncertainties in E, ne and Te at the edge, which render the radial
matching of the different profiles problematic. Conversely, if it were possible
to obtain a set of line-integrated values for Zeff directly from the
line-integrated measurements of E, ne and Te, then these problems would be
avoided. Now, recent advances in the field of statistical signal processing
allow the extraction of an unknown signal from a signal mixture. In particular,
we describe a procedure for the single-channel Bayesian source separation of a
line-integrated Zeff signal from a line-integrated emissivity source, using as
a forward model a linearized version of the known functional dependence of Zeff
on E, ne and Te. Here, a line-integral over a traditionally obtained Zeff
profile may serve as a prior for the line-integrated Zeff signal. In this way,
precise information on the electron density and temperature may even become
superfluous for the determination of Zeff.

more codons have been reassigned to a different amino acid from that in the

reassignment, based on the observation that reassignment involves a gain and a
loss. The loss could be the deletion or loss of function of a tRNA or release
factor. The gain could be the gain of a new type of tRNA for the reassigned
codon, or the gain of function of an existing tRNA due to a mutation or a base
modification. In the codon disappearance mechanism, the codon disappears from
the genome during the period of reassignment. In the other mechanisms, the
codon does not disappear. In the ambiguous intermediate mechanism, the gain
precedes the loss; in the unassigned codon mechanism, the loss precedes the
gain; and in the compensatory change mechanism, the loss and gain spread
through the population simultaneously. We present simulations of the gain-loss
model and demonstrate that all four mechanisms are possible. The frequencies of
the different mechanisms are influenced by selection strengths, number of
codons undergoing reassignment, directional mutation pressure and the
possibility of selection for reduced genome size.

cross-distribution, whose nondiagonal elements characterize the graph structure
beyond link distribution, cluster coefficient and average path length. From

This Offdiagonal Complexity (OdC) is proposed as a novel measure to
characterize the complexity of an undirected graph, or network. While both for
regular lattices and fully connected networks OdC is zero, it takes a
moderately low value for a random graph and shows high values for apparently
