at such large distances, their energies would not fit the observed correlation
between the GRB peak energy and isotropic energy release, in which soft bursts
are less energetic. We conclude that, should these XRFs reside at low redshifts

phase with masses of ~1.5-3 M_o. They show rather intense surface activity
(Dunkin et al. 1997) and infrared excess related to the presence of
circumstellar disks. Because of their youth, primordial magnetic fields
inherited from the parent molecular cloud may be expected, but no direct
evidence for the presence of magnetic fields on their surface, except in one
case (Donati et al. 1997), has been found until now. Here we report
observations of optical circular polarization with FORS 1 at the VLT in the
three Herbig Ae stars HD 139614, HD 144432 and HD 144668. A definite
longitudinal magnetic field at 4.8 sigma level, <B_z>=-450+-93 G, has been
detected in the Herbig Ae star HD 139614. This is the largest magnetic field
ever diagnosed for a Herbig Ae star. A hint of a weak magnetic field is found
in the other two Herbig Ae stars, HD 144432 and HD 144668, for which magnetic
fields are measured at the ~1.6 sigma and ~2.5 sigma level respectively.
Further, we report the presence of circular polarization signatures in the Ca
II K line in the V Stokes spectra of HD 139614 and HD 144432, which appear
unresolved at the low spectral resolution achievable with FORS 1. We suggest
that models involving accretion of matter from the disk to the star along a
global stellar magnetic field of a specific geometry can account for the
observed Zeeman signatures.

of the crack, and address the robustness of the roughening exponent. Next we
develop the theory further, to include two voids ahead of the crack. This
development necessitates generalizing the method of iterated conformal maps to
include doubly connected regions (maps from the annulus rather than the unit
circle). While mathematically and numerically feasible, we find that the
employment of the stress field as computed from elasticity theory becomes
questionable when more than one void is explicitly inserted into the material.
Thus further progress in this line of research calls for improved treatment of
the plastic dynamics.

values and fluctuations of the linearised gravitational field are small. Such

analyse the nature of this approximation for the graviton vacuum state in the
context of kinematical Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) wherein the constraints are
ignored. We identify the graviton vacuum state with kinematically
non-normalizable, distributional states in LQG by demanding that relations
between linearised operator actions on the former are mirrored by those of
their non-linear counterparts on the latter. We define a semi- norm on the
space of kinematical distributions and show that the identification is
approximate upto distributions which are small in this semi-norm. We argue that
our candidate states are annihilated by the linearised constraints (expressed
as operators in the full theory) to leading order in the parameter
characterising the approximation. This suggests the possibility, in a scheme
such as ours, of solving the full constraints order by order in this parameter.
The main drawback of our considerations is that they depend on certain
auxilliary constructions which, though mathematically well defined, do not
arise from physical insight. Our work is an attempt to implement an earlier
proposal of Iwasaki and Rovelli.

viscosity and linear friction, is modeled by a statistical field theory. The
fluid's long-distance behavior is studied using renormalization-group (RG)
methods, as begun by Forster, Nelson, and Stephen [Phys. Rev. A 16, 732
(1977)]. With friction, which dissipates energy at low wavenumbers, one expects
a stationary inverse energy cascade for strong enough stirring. While such
developed turbulence is beyond the quantitative reach of perturbation theory, a
combination of exact and perturbative results suggests a coherent picture of
the inverse cascade. The zero-friction fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is
derived from a generalized time-reversal symmetry and implies zero anomalous
dimension for the velocity even when friction is present. Thus the Kolmogorov
scaling of the inverse cascade cannot be explained by any RG fixed point. The
beta function for the dimensionless coupling ghat is computed through two
loops; the ghat^3 term is positive, as already known, but the ghat^5 term is
negative. An ideal cascade requires a linear beta function for large ghat,
consistent with a Pad\'e approximant to the Borel transform. The conjecture
that the Kolmogorov spectrum arises from an RG flow through large ghat is
compatible with other results, but the accurate k^{-5/3} scaling is not
explained and the Kolmogorov constant is not estimated. The lack of scale
invariance should produce intermittency in high-order structure functions, as
observed in some but not all numerical simulations of the inverse cascade. When
analogous RG methods are applied to the one-dimensional Burgers equation using
an FDT-preserving dimensional continuation, equipartition is obtained instead
of a cascade--in agreement with simulations.

to the study of the anisotropy in the neutron and hard X-ray radiation.
Concerning the former, it has been observed that there is an anisotropic
distribution superposed on a far larger isotropic one. These clearly separated
effects can be interpreted as the consequence of two different neutron emission
mechanisms. The angular distribution of hard X-rays and ions is also studied
within the chamber with TLD and CR-39 detectors respectively. Two maxima are
found around the axis of the device for X rays within the 20-200 keV range.

  detailed studies of ablation phenamena and mechanism","12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25-29 October 2004,
  Nice (France)",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  From the viewpoint of performance of nuclear fusion plasmas, pellet injection
experiments have been actively carried out in many toroidal devices in the
sense of controlling density profile, obtaining high density or improved
confinement, and diagnostic purposes. In order to have a common measure of
pellet ablation, the regression study has been performed as an international
cooperation activity, obtaining ""IPAD"" (International Pellet Ablation Database)
>. However, these are an empirical scaling, and the mechanism of pellet
ablation still remains to be studied. According to the code calculations based
on a typical pellet ablation model (e. g., so-called the neutral gas shielding
model), it is understood that the penetration depth into plasma is always quite
sensitive to the pellet size. If the pellet size is too large, the pellet
passes through the plasma, and if it is too small, it is trapped at the plasma
surface. Also, an effective or suitable range of the pellet size for a certain
plasma is generally very narrow, and this range largely varies depending on
each plasma size and plasma parameters. Thus, the precise controllability of
the pellet size, especially the size controllability with continuously variable
system will be quite effective in order to carry out the detailed studies on
pellet ablation and associated phenomena. A pellet injector of new type with
precisely and continuously controllable system of pellet size is being
developed. This has a unique mechanics and structure of producing a frozen
pellet in extremely low temperature region. In the device presently developed
in this research, we will precisely adjust the length of the cylindrical pellet
($\Phi$ 1.0mm) from 0.5 to 3 mm by using the special ""length restriction
rod"".&#12288;&#12288;

dressed states to a nonlinear version of this system. Also we clarify some
misunderstandings about the concept of dressed coordinates. Indeed now we
prefer to call them renormalized coordinates to emphasize the analogy with the
renormalized fields in quantum field theory.

  electrostatic probe techniques","12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25-29 October 2004,
  Nice (France)",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  Hollow cathode discharges (HCD) are capable of generating dense plasmas and
have been used for development of high-rate, low-pressure, high-efficiency
processing machines. The geometric feature of a HCD promotes oscillations of
hot electrons inside the cathode, thereby enhancing ionization, ion bombardment
of inner walls and other subsequent processes. At the same power the hollow
cathode exhibits plasma density one to two orders of magnitude higher than that
of conventional planar electrodes. The aim of the present studies was to obtain
experimental observations about the main features of a dc hollow cathode
discharge in order to evaluate its capability of generating compounds in the
plasma medium, by reaction between sputtered species from the cathode and
radicals from the gas discharge. Especial interest is focused on aluminum
nitride (AlN) formation which is very desirable if a deposition of thin film of
this material is concerned. Plasma properties were inferred from the
current-voltage characteristics of a single Langmuir probe positioned at the
inter-cathode space. Through mass spectrometry technique some species in the
plasma gas phase could be monitored for various operating conditions of the
discharge. This mass analysis together with the probe measurements gives
guidance for optimization of AlN generation in the discharge consequently for
deposition of thin films of this material.

  Nice (France)",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  The formation and evolution of coherent structures in a low-energy electron
beam produced in a Malmberg-Penning trap is investigated by means of CCD
diagnostics. The electrons are emitted from a thermionic cathode and their
energy is controlled by an acceleration grid. By varying the spatial
distribution of the energy of emitted electrons, different space charge effects
are observed, as, e. g., a sharp or a gradual transition to a space charge
dominated regime. The variation of the coherent structures along the beam is
studied by varying the electron density or/and the value of the confined
magnetic field. The observed processes are interpreted using a tridimensional
particle-in-cell code which solves the Vlasov-Poisson system in zeroth order
drift approximation.

database for helical systems and to demonstrate such extended plasma
confinement properties to be sustained in steady state. Among the various
plasma parameter regimes, the study of confinement properties in the
collisionless regime is of particular importance. Electron cyclotron resonance
heating (ECRH) has been extensively used for these confinement studies of the
LHD plasma from the initial operation. The system optimizations including the
modification of the transmission and antenna system are performed with the
special emphasis on the local heating properties. As the result, central
electron temperature of more than 10 keV with the electron density of 0.6 x
10$^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ is achieved near the magnetic axis. The electron temperature
profile is characterized by a steep gradient similar to those of an internal
transport barrier observed in tokamaks and stellarators. 168 GHz ECRH system
demonstrated efficient heating at over the density more than 1.0 x 10$^{20}$
m$^{-3}$. CW ECRH system is successfully operated to sustain 756 s discharge.
