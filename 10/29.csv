cold, magnetocentrifugally launched winds from accretion disks. Our simulations
span four and half decades of mass loading; in the context of a disk with a
launching region from $0.1\AU$ to $1.0\AU$ around a $1\solarmass$ star and a
field strength of about $20\gauss$ at the inner disk edge, this amounts to mass
loss rates of $1\times 10^{-9}$ -- $3\times 10^{-5}\solarmassyear$ from each
side of the disk. We find that the degree of collimation of the wind increases
with mass loading; however even the ``lightest'' wind simulated is
significantly collimated compared with the force-free magnetic configuration of
the same magnetic flux distribution. The implication is that for flows from
young stellar objects a radial field approximation is inappropriate.
Surprisingly, the terminal velocity of the wind and the magnetic lever arm are
still well-described by the analytical solutions for a radial field geometry.
We also find that the isodensity contours and Alfv\'en surface are very nearly
self-similar in mass loading. The wind becomes unsteady above some critical
mass loading rate. For a small enough injection speed, we are able to obtain
the first examples of a class of heavily-loaded magnetocentrifugal winds with
magnetic fields completely dominated by the toroidal component all the way to
the launching surface.

using colour anomalies owing to the silicate absorption feature around 9.7(1+z)

silicate-break galaxies with the SED model of both starbursts and quiescent
star-forming galaxies, and then verify the method by using the observed spectra
of nearby galaxies. We would expect that about 1000 candidates of
silicate-break galaxies could be detected per square degree in current and

the degeneracy between various galaxy evolution models for extragalactic source

Thermodynamics. This model has the capability of making definite predictions
in-line with the current observations of the universe. According to this model,
cosmos was expanding slower at the beginning. During the galaxy formation era
(with redshifts [0.54-0.91]), due to a change in the global equation of state
it accelerates for a brief period of time. We expect to see this as a
discontinuity in the Hubble diagram. Recent data about the galaxies with
redshifts 0.5<z<0.9 displays this discontinuity clearly. We expect the
deceleration to re-appear as more data with redshifts z>1 is gathered. These
galaxies will be among the very first galaxies formed in the universe, thus
still showing the kinematics of the pre-galaxy formation era. This point is now
clearly evidenced in the recent data by Riess et al. on Type Ia supernovae with

high-resolution dissipationless simulations that resolve subhalos. We find that
the halo model reliably determines parameters such as the host halo mass of
central galaxies, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, and their
radial distribution inside larger halos. If there is a significant scatter
present in the central galaxy host halo mass distribution, then the mean and
median mass of that distribution can differ significantly from one another, and
the halo model mass determination lies between the two. This result suggests
that when analyzing the data, galaxy subsamples with a narrow central galaxy
halo mass distribution, such as those based on stellar mass, should be chosen
for a simpler interpretation of the results.

that the hole's rotation necessarily limits the radial extent of the force-free
link on the disk surface: the faster the hole rotates, the smaller the
magnetically-connected inner part of the disk has to be. We then show that this
is indeed the case by solving numerically the Grad--Shafranov equation--the
main differential equation describing the structure of the magnetosphere. An
important element in our approach is the use of the regularity condition at the
inner light cylinder to fix the poloidal current as a function of the poloidal
magnetic flux. As an outcome of our computations, we are able to chart out the
maximum allowable size of the portion of the disk that is magnetically
connected to the hole as a function of the black hole spin. We also calculate
the angular momentum and energy transfer between the hole and the disk that
takes place via the direct magnetic link. We find that both of these quantities
grow rapidly and that their deposition becomes highly concentrated near the
inner edge of the disk as the black hole spin is increased.

Free energy in differential rotation and rotation can be extracted magnetically

SN progenitors. We develop a dynamical large scale interface dynamo model in
which the differential rotation and rotation deplete both through Poynting flux
and turbulent diffusion. We apply the model to a differentially rotating core
surrounded by a convection zone of a SN progenitor from a initial 15$M_\odot$
star. Unlike the Sun, the dynamo is transient because the differential rotation
is primarily due to the initial collapse. Up to $\sim 10^{51}$erg can be
drained into time-integrated Poynting flux and heat, the relative fraction of
which depends on the relative amount of turbulence in the shear layer vs.
convection zone and the fraction of the shear layer into which the magnetic
field penetrates. Both sinks can help facilitate explosions and could lead to
different levels of anisotropy and pulsar kicks. In all cases, the poloidal
magnetic field is much weaker than the toroidal field, and the Poynting flux is
lower than previous estimates which invoke the magnitude of the total magnetic
energy. A signature of a large scale dynamo is that the oscillation of the

function of jet viewing angle. Jet morphology argues against viewing angles
larger than 12 deg. At a 12 deg viewing angle the most likely scenario involves
a decline in jet sound speed from c/3 < a_j < c/1.7 at ~0.5 mas from the core

are greater than would be expected from adiabatic compressions associated with

the CAS parameters of paired galaxies are correlated with the projected

tend to be similar to those of isolated and ongoing major mergers (ULIRGs),
respectively. Our results imply that galaxy CAS morphology is a robust quantity
that only changes significantly during a strong interaction or major merger.
The typical time-scale for this change in our paired sample, based on dynamical
friction arguments, is short, t ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Gyr. We find average enhancement
factors for the spiral pair asymmetries and clumpiness values of ~2.2 and 1.5.
The S parameter, which is related to star formation activity, has a moderate
level of enhancement suggesting that this activity in modern spirals depends
more on internal processes than on external conditions. We furthermore test the
statistical criterion for picking up interacting galaxies in an automated way

to compare their eccentricities. The positions of the objects in the

period-eccentricity diagram that are not affected by tidal circularization. The
original eccentricities of binaries and planets are derived and compared. They
seem to be weakly or not at all correlated with period in both samples, but two
major differences are found :(1) The tidal circularization of planetary orbits
is almost complete for periods shorter than 5 days, but it is not visible when
P.(1-e^2)^{3/2} is longer than this limit. This suggests that the
circularization occurs rapidly after the end of the migration process and is
probably simultaneous with the end of the formation of the planet. By contrast,
we confirm that the circularization of the binary orbits is a process still
progressing a long time after the formation of the systems.(2) Beyond the
circularization limit, the eccentricities of the orbits of the planets are
significantly smaller than those of binary orbits, and this discrepancy cannot
be due to a selection effect. Moreover, the eccentricities of binaries with
small mass ratios are quite similar to those of all binaries with q<0.8. This
suggests that the low eccentricities of exoplanet orbits are not a consequence
of low-mass secondaries in a universal process.
  These remarks are in favor of the idea that binaries and exoplanets are two
different classes of object from the point of view of their formation.

The simulations are done with dimensionless units, and the results are
applicable to low-mass as well as massive systems by scaling with the initial
density. We find that if the initial angular momentum is as small as $\beta
\approx 0.1$, where $\beta$ is the ratio of centrifugal force to pressure
force, then the runaway collapse of the cloud stops to form a
rotationally-supported disk. After the accretion of the envelope, the disk
undergoes a ring instability, eventually fragmenting into a binary. If the
initial angular momentum is relatively large, a bar-type instability arises,
resulting in the collapse into a single star through rapid angular momentum
transfer. The present results show that a significant fraction of Pop III stars
are expected to form in binary systems, even if they are quite massive or less
massive. The cosmological implications of Population III binaries are briefly

in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the plane of the Galaxy, even on scales
under 50 pc. Nevertheless, multi-phase models of the ISM assume at least
locally isobaric gas. The pressure then determines the density reached by gas
cooling to stable thermal equilibrium. We use numerical models of the
magnetized ISM to examine the consequences of supernova driving for
interstellar pressures. In this paper we examine a (200 pc)^3 periodic domain
threaded by magnetic fields. Individual parcels of gas at different pressures
reach widely varying points on the thermal equilibrium curve: no unique set of
phases is found, but rather a dynamically-determined continuum of densities and
temperatures. A substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal
equilibrium. Our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar
pressures. They also suggest that the high pressures observed in molecular
clouds may be due to ram pressures in addition to gravitational forces. Much of
the gas in our model lies far from equipartition between thermal and magnetic
pressures, with ratios ranging from 0.1 to $10^4$ and ratios of uniform to
fluctuating magnetic field of 0.5--1. Our models show broad pressure
probability distribution functions with log-normal functional forms produced by
both shocks and rarefaction waves, rather than power-law distributions produced
by isolated supernova remnants. The width of the distribution can be described
quantitatively by a formula derived from the work of Padoan, Nordlund, & Jones

approximation. We apply these generalizations to the orbit evolution of
satellite galaxies in Dark Matter haloes. We find from the analysis that the
main influence occurs through a position-dependent maximum impact parameter in
the Coulomb logarithm, which is determined by the local scale-length of the
density distribution. We also show that for eccentric orbits the explicit
dependence of the Coulomb logarithm on position yields significant differences
for the standard homogeneous force. Including the velocity dependence of the
Coulomb logarithm yields ambigous results. The orbital fits in the first few
periods are further improved, but the deviations at later times are much
larger. The additional force induced by the density gradient, the inhomogeneous
force, is not antiparallel to the satellite motion and can exceed 10% of the
homogeneous friction force in magnitude. However, due to the symmetry
properties of the inhomogeneous force, there is a deformation and no secular
effect on the orbit at the first order. Therefore the inhomogeneous force can
be safely neglected for the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies. For the
homogeneous force we compare numerical N-body calculations with semi-analytical
orbits to determine quantitatively the accuracy of the generalized formulae of
the Coulomb logarithm in the Chandresekhar approach. With the local
scale-length as the maximum impact parameter we find a significant improvement
of the orbital fits and a better interpretation of the quantitative value of
the Coulomb logarithm.

critical temperature of the Mott transition is much higher than the quantum
degeneracy temperature, the transition is essentially described by the Ising
universality class. Below the critical temperature, phase separation or
first-order transition occurs. However, if the critical point is involved in
the Fermi degeneracy region, a marginal quantum critical point appears at zero
temperature. The originally single Mott critical point generates subsequent
many unstable fixed points through various Fermi surface instabilities induced
by the Mott criticality characterized by the diverging charge susceptibility or
doublon susceptibility. This occurs in marginal quantum-critical region.
Charge, magnetic and superconducting instabilitites compete severely under
these critical charge fluctuations. The quantum Mott transition triggers
multi-furcating criticality, which goes beyond the conventional concept of
multicriticality in quantum phase transitions. Near the quantum Mott
transition, the criticality generically drives growth of inhomogeneous
structure in the momentum space with singular points of flat dispersion on the
Fermi surface. The singular points determine the quantum dynamics of the Mott
transition by the dynamical exponent $z=4$. We argue that many of
filling-control Mott transitions are classified to this category. Recent
numerical results as well as experimental results on strongly correlated
systems including transition metal oxides, organic materials and $^3$He layer
adsorbed on a substrate are consistently analyzed especially in two-dimensional
systems.

ReCord with $O(\log n)$ node degree has an expected latency of $\Theta(\log n)$

therefore, a gluon cannot propagate over extended distances. That is, the gluon

discuss the properties of both the Euclidean-space and Minkowski-space gluon

running coupling of QCD is studied. This running coupling has no unphysical
singularities, and in the absence of masses displays infrared enhancement. The
inclusion of the effects due to the mass of the lightest hadron is accomplished
by employing the dispersion relation for the Adler D function. The presence of
the nonvanishing pion mass tames the aforementioned enhancement, giving rise to
a finite value for the running coupling at the origin. In addition, the
effective charge acquires a ""plateau-like"" behavior in the low energy region of
the timelike domain. This plateau is found to be in agreement with a number of
phenomenological models for the strong running coupling. The developed
invariant charge is applied in the processing of experimental data on the
inclusive $\tau$ lepton decay. The effects due to the pion mass play an
essential role here as well, affecting the value of the QCD scale parameter
$\Lambda$ extracted from these data. Finally, the massive analytic running
coupling is compared with the effective coupling arising from the study of
Schwinger-Dyson equations, whose infrared finiteness is due to a dynamically
generated gluon mass. A qualitative picture of the possible impact of the
former coupling on the chiral symmetry breaking is presented.

analysis of the ratios R_c and R_n of the CP-averaged branching ratios of the
charged and neutral B -> pi K modes, respectively, suggested new physics (NP)
in the electroweak penguin sector, which may have a powerful interplay with
rare decays. In this paper, we confront our strategy with recent experimental
developments, addressing also the direct CP violation in B_d -> pi^-+ K^+-,
which is now an established effect, the relation to its counterpart in B^+- ->
pi^0 K^+-, and the first results for the direct CP asymmetry of B_d -> pi^0
pi^0 that turn out to be in agreement with our prediction. We obtain hadronic B
-> pi pi,pi K parameters which are almost unchanged and arrive at an allowed
region for the unitarity triangle in perfect accordance with the SM. The ``B ->
pi K puzzle'' persists, and can still be explained through NP, as in our
previous analysis. In fact, the recently observed shifts in the experimental
values of R_c and R_n have been predicted in our framework on the basis of
constraints from rare decays. Conversely, we obtain a moderate deviation of the
ratio R of the CP-averaged B_d -> pi^-+ K^+- and B^+- -> pi^+- K rates from the
current experimental value. However, using the emerging signals for B^+- ->
K^+- K modes, this effect can be attributed to certain hadronic effects, which
have a minor impact on R_c and do not at all affect R_n. Our results for rare
decays remain unchanged.

structures underlying both planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory and type IIB
string theory on AdS_5 x S^5. Integrability in the gauge theory emerges from
the fact that the dilatation generator can be identified with the Hamiltonian
of an integrable quantum spin chain, and the classical string theory has been
shown to contain infinite towers of hidden currents, a typical signature of
integrability. Efforts to match the integrable structures of various classical
string configurations to those of corresponding gauge theory quantum spin
chains have been largely successful. By studying a semiclassical expansion
about a class of point-like solitonic solutions to the classical string
equations of motion on AdS_5 x S^5, we take a step toward demonstrating that
integrability in the string theory survives quantum corrections beyond tree
level. Quantum fluctuations are chosen to align with background curvature
corrections to the pp-wave limit of AdS_5 x S^5, and we present evidence for an
infinite tower of local bosonic charges that are conserved by the quantum
theory to quartic order in the expansion. We explicitly compute several higher
charges based on a Lax representation of the worldsheet sigma model and provide
a prescription for matching the eigenvalue spectra of these charges with
corresponding quantities descending from the integrable structure of the gauge
theory.

This rule is lifted by heavy branes, which effectively convert the Higgs mass
into a dynamical variable. The key point is that a discrete
""brane-charge-conjugation"" symmetry guarantees that the fineness of the
vacuum-scanning is set by the Higgs mass itself. On a resulting landscape in
all, but a measure-zero set of vacua the Higgs mass has a common
hierarchically-small value. In minimal models this value is controlled by the
QCD scale and is of the right magnitude. Although in each particular vacuum
there is no visible UV-regulating low energy physics, the realistic models are
predictive. For example, we show that in the minimal case the ""charge
conjugation"" symmetry is automatically a family symmetry, and imposes severe
restrictions on quark Yukawa matrices.

D71 (2005) 104015","10.1103/PhysRevD.71.104015",,"hep-th",,"  Killing-Yano tensors are natural generalizations of Killing vectors to
arbitrary rank anti-symmetric tensor fields. It was recently shown that
Killing-Yano tensors lead to conserved gravitational charges, called Y-ADM
charges. These new charges are interesting because they measure, for example,
the mass density of a p-brane, rather than the total ADM mass which may be
infinite. In this paper, we show that the spinorial techniques used by Witten,
in his proof of the positive energy theorem, may be straightforwardly extended
to study the positivity properties of the Y-ADM mass density for p-brane
spacetimes. Although the resulting formalism is quite similar to the ADM case,
we show that establishing a positivity bound in the higher rank Y-ADM case
requires imposing a condition on the Weyl tensor in addition to an energy
condition. We find appropriate energy conditions for spacetimes that are
conformally flat or algebraically special, and for spacetimes that have an
exact Killing vector along the brane. Finally we discuss our expression for the
Y-ADM mass density from the Hamiltonian point of view.

pseudoholomorphic curves. In the last section, we discuss applications (or

follows. Let A be an associative ring and let A-->B be the localisation with
respect to a set sigma of maps between finitely generated projective A-modules.
Suppose that Tor_n^A(B,B) vanishes for all n>0. View each map in sigma as a
complex (of length 1, meaning one non-zero map between two non-zero objects) in
the category of perfect complexes D^perf(A). Denote by <sigma> the thick
subcategory generated by these complexes. Then the canonical functor
D^perf(A)-->D^perf(B) induces (up to direct factors) an equivalence
D^perf(A)/<sigma>--> D^perf(B). As a consequence, one obtains a homotopy fibre
sequence K(A,sigma)-->K(A)-->K(B) (up to surjectivity of K_0(A)-->K_0(B)) of
Waldhausen K-theory spectra.

the main theorem in a form more suitable for the applications to surgery. For
example if, in addition to the vanishing of Tor_n^A(B,B), we also assume that
every map in sigma is a monomorphism, then there is a description of the
homotopy fiber of the map K(A)-->K(B) as the Quillen K-theory of a suitable

permits to find both optimum operating conditions of existing plasmochemical

effectiveness of destruction of the substances, increasing destruction speed,
reducing consumption of electric power and consumable chemicals, and a whole

of the registering apparatus to control plasmotrons'operating conditions in

the use of nonlinear geometrical theory for the description of surface

normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing
computational methods for the genome-wide ``reverse engineering'' of such
networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes.
Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression
profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory
networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of
network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic
approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by
co-expression methods.
  Results: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly
(asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible,
and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of
numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to
reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic
synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic
datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms established
methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the
deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's
ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the c MYC proto-oncogene.
We also study the effects of mis estimation of mutual information on network
reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking
are more resilient to estimation errors.

Zanardi et al is rigorously established. The concept of relative quantum
entanglement is naturally introduced and its meaning is made clear both
mathematically and physically. For a finite or an infinite dimensional vector
space $W$ the so called tensor product partition (TPP) is introduced on
$End(W)$, the set of endmorphisms of $W$, and a natural correspondence is
constructed between the set of TPP's of $End(W)$ and the set of tensor product

given wave function belonging to an n-dimensional Hilbert space, $n$ being not
a prime number, can be interpreted as a separable state with respect to some
man-made TPS, and thus a quantum entangled state of a many-body system with

two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice models, which exhibit mixing of the
noninteracting eigenfunctions and transition from integrability to quantum
chaos. Contrary to what occurs in a quantum phase transition, the onset of
quantum chaos is not a property of the ground state but take place for any
typical many-spin quantum state. We study bipartite and pairwise entanglement
measures, namely the reduced Von Neumann entropy and the concurrence, and
discuss quantum entanglement sharing. Our results suggest that the behavior of
the entanglement is related to the mixing of the eigenfunctions rather than to
the transition to chaos.
