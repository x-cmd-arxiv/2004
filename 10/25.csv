Plasmas",,"10.1063/1.1812536",,"astro-ph",,"  The identification of pre-acceleration mechanisms for cosmic ray ions in
supernova remnant shocks is an important problem in astrophysics. Recent
particle-in-cell (PIC) shock simulations have shown that inclusion of the full
electron kinetics yields non-time-stationary solutions, in contrast to previous
hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulations. Here, by running a PIC code
at high phase space resolution, ion acceleration mechanisms associated with the
time dependence of a supercritical collisionless perpendicular shock are
examined. In particular the components of $\int \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} dt$
are analysed along trajectories for ions that reach both high and low energies.
Selection mechanisms for the ions that reach high energies are also examined.
In contrast to quasi-stationary shock solutions, the suprathermal protons are
selected from the background population on the basis of the time at which they
arrive at the shock, and thus are generated in bursts.

lead to a) a higher [O/Fe] at low metallicities or b) younger stellar

massive stellar halo in M31, which suggests a possible correlation between the

critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere with a central density of \sim 10^4 cm^{-3} in one

where alpha is the internal gravity-to-pressure ratio. The alpha=1.1 model
shows reasonable agreement with the observed velocity field in prestellar
cores. Molecular distributions in cores are calculated by solving a chemical
reaction network that includes both gas-phase and grain-surface reactions. When
the central density of the core reaches 10^5 cm^{-3}, carbon-bearing species
are significantly depleted in the central region of the alpha=1.1 model, while
the depletion is only marginal in the other model. The two different approaches
encompass the observed variations of molecular distributions in different
prestellar cores, suggesting that molecular distributions can be probes of
contraction or accumulation time scales of cores. The central enhancement of
the NH3/N2H+ ratio, which is observed in some prestellar cores, can be
reproduced under certain conditions by adopting recently measured branching
fractions for N2H+ recombination. Various molecular species, such as CH3OH and
CO2, are produced by grain-surface reactions. The ice composition depends
sensitively on the assumed temperature. Multi-deuterated species are included
in our most recent gas-grain chemical network. The deuterated isotopomers of
H3+ are useful as probes of the central regions of evolved cores, in which
gas-phase species with heavy elements are strongly depleted. At 10 K, our model
can reproduce the observed abundance ratio of ND3/NH3, but underestimates the
isotopic ratios of deuterated to normal methanol.

Coriolis number, Co = 2 Omega tau, from zero to roughly ten, and by calculating
models at different latitudes. We find that \alpha decreases monotonically as a
function of the Coriolis number. This can be explained by the decreased spatial
scale of convection and the diminished efficiency of the convective energy
transport, the latter of which leads to a large increase of the
superadibaticity, \delta = \nabla - \nabla_ad as function of Co. Applying a
decreased mixing length parameter in a solar model yields very small
differences in comparison to the standard model within the convection zone. The
main difference is the reduction of the overshooting depth, and thus the depth
of the convection zone, when a non-local version of the mixing length concept
is used. Reduction of \alpha by a factor of roughly 2.5 is sufficient to
reconcile the difference between the model and helioseismic results. The

Strouhal number arises in the mean-field theories of angular momentum transport

certain widely used approximations, such as the first order smoothing

calculated by means of a cumulative series expansion if St < St_crit \approx 1.
Methods: We define the Strouhal number as the ratio of the correlation and
turnover times, which we determine separately, the former from the
autocorrelation of velocity, and the latter by following test particles

generally, of the order of 0.1 to 0.4 which is close to the critical value
above which deviations from FOSA become significant. Increasing the rotational
influence tends to shorten both timescales in such a manner that St decreases.

more detail to determine at which extent Dark Matter has to be necessarily
weakly interacting. To this purpose, we compute the collisional damping (and
free-streaming) lengths of generic interacting Dark Matter candidates and
compare them to the scale of the smallest primordial structures known to exist

satisfy. We point out the existence of new Dark Matter scenarios and exhibit
new damping regimes. For example, an interacting candidate may bear a similar
damping than that of collisionless Warm Dark Matter particles. The main
difference is due to the Dark Matter coupling to interacting (or even
freely-propagating) species. Our approach yields a general classification of

find power-law relationships between these two wavelength bands for the flare

clusters can only reside in the most centrally concentrated clusters, with a
so-called `core-collapsed' density profile. While this would be a natural
guess, it is in fact wrong. We have followed the evolution of star clusters
containing IMBHs with masses between 125 \le M_{BH} \le 1000 M_{\odot} through
detailed N-body simulations, and we find that a cluster with an IMBH, in
projection, appears to have a relatively large `core' with surface brightness
only slightly rising toward the center. This makes it highly unlikely that any
of `core-collapsed' clusters will harbor an IMBH. On the contrary, the places
to look for an IMBH are those clusters that can be fitted well by
medium-concentration King models.
  The velocity dispersion of the visible stars in a globular cluster with an
IMBH is nearly constant well inside the apparent core radius. For a cluster of
mass M_C containing an IMBH of mass M_{BH}, the influence of the IMBH becomes
significant only at a fraction 2.5 M_{BH}/M_C of the half-mass radius, deep
within the core, where it will affect only a small number of stars. In
conclusion, observational detection of an IMBH may be possible, but will be
challenging.

excellent match to the observational data. We propose that the main carrier of
the 2175-band is CO chemisorbed at bare surfaces of dust grains in the

gas-surface interactions do not have to result in the formation of ice mantles

10-19 cm molecule-1. The abundance of CO adsorbed at bare grain surfaces ranges
from 0.06 to 0.16 relative to H2O ice, which is, at most, half of the abundance
(relative to H2O ice) of CO residing in H2O-dominated ice environments. These
findings imply that interstellar grains have a large (catalytically-active)
surface area, providing a refuge for interstellar species. Consequently the
potential exists for heterogeneous chemistry to occur involving CO molecules in
unique surface chemistry pathways not currently considered in gas-grain models

applied voltage is at the heart of modern electronics. In many cases, it is the
so-called electric field effect that allows one to vary the carrier
concentration in a semiconductor device and, consequently, change an electric
current through it. As the semiconductor industry is nearing the limits of
performance improvements for the current technologies dominated by silicon,
there is a constant search for new, non-traditional materials whose properties
can be controlled by electric field. Most notable examples of such materials
developed recently are organic conductors [1], oxides near a superconducting or
magnetic phase transition [2] and carbon nanotubes [3-5]. Here, we describe
another system of this kind - thin monocrystalline films of graphite - which
exhibits a pronounced electric field effect, such that carriers in the
conductive channel can be turned into either electrons or holes. The films
remain metallic, continuous and of high quality down to a few atomic layers in
thickness. The demonstrated ease of preparing such films of nearly macroscopic
sizes and of their processing by standard microfabrication techniques, combined
with submicron-scale ballistic transport even at room temperature, offer a new
two-dimensional system controllable by electric-field doping and provide a
realistic promise of device applications.

for an ideal checkerboard ordering with a single antiferromagnetic exchange

reasonable description of the measured dispersion. Above 30 meV the excitations
are not fully consistent with the linear spin-wave model, with modes near the

energy as a function of angular momentum by finding the corresponding solutions

in the case of two spikes (twist two operators), there is agreement in the
functional form but not in the coupling constant dependence. After that, we
analyze the system in more detail and find an effective classical mechanics
describing the motion of the spikes. In the appropriate limit, it is the same
(up to the coupling constant dependence) as the coherent state description of
linear combinations of the operators O_{m_1 ... m_n} such that all m_i are
equal on average. This agreement provides a map between the operators in the
boundary and the position of the spikes in the bulk. We further suggest that
moving the spikes in other directions should describe operators with

This framework is based on the jet bundle of a time-dependent configuration
space, and is an extension of the geometric framework of the autonomous case.
When A is a singular matrix, the solutions can be obtained by means of
constraint algorithms, either directly or through an equivalent autonomous

the variety X is called dually degenerate.
  The authors refine these definitions for a variety X \subset P^N with a
degenerate Gauss map of rank r. For such a variety, in the general case, the
dimension of its dual variety X* is N - l - 1, where l = n - r, and X is dually
degenerate if dim X* < N - l - 1.
  In 1979 Griffiths and Harris proved that a smooth variety X \subset P^N is

process to reach a black MRAC or a white MRAC, respectively, is $3-2/n$. On the

arithmetic. Kaye, Kossak, and Kotlarski introduced the notion of arithmetic
saturation and argued that recursive saturation might not be as rigid as first
assumed.
  In this thesis we give further examples of variations of recursive
saturation, all of which are connected with expandability properties similar to
resplendence. However, the expandability properties are stronger than
resplendence and implies, in one way or another, that the expansion not only
satisfies a theory, but also omits a type. We conjecture that a special version
of this expandability is in fact equivalent to arithmetic saturation. We prove
that another of these properties is equivalent to \beta-saturation. We also
introduce a variant on recursive saturation which makes sense in the context of
a standard predicate, and which is equivalent to a certain amount of ordinary
saturation.
  The theory of all models which omit a certain type p(x) is also investigated.
We define a proof system, which proves a sentence if and only if it is true in
all models omitting the type p(x). The complexity of such proof systems are
discussed and some explicit examples of theories and types with high
complexity, in a special sense, are given.

the assumption of Martin's axiom, every Scott set of cardinality <2^{\aleph_0}
closed under arithmetic comprehension which has the countable chain condition
is the standard system of some model of PA. However, we do not know if there

Using the finite-difference time-domain simulations, we study wave transmission
through the slab of nonlinear left-handed material, and predict existence of
temporal solitons in such materials. We demonstrate also that nonlinear
left-handed metamaterials can support both TE- and TM-polarized self-trapped
localized beams, spatial electromagnetic solitons. Such solitons appear as
single- and multi-hump beams, being either symmetric or antisymmetric, and they
can exist due to the hysteresis-type magnetic nonlinearity and the effective
domains of negative magnetic permeability.

difference \Delta \nu in the relative frequencies of two cavity-stabilized
lasers, upon local rotations of the apparatus or under the Earth's rotation. If
the small deviations observed in the classical ether-drift experiments were not
mere instrumental artifacts, by replacing the high vacuum in the resonating
cavities with a dielectric gaseous medium (e.g. air), the typical measured
\Delta\nu\sim 1 Hz should increase by orders of magnitude. This prediction is
consistent with the characteristic modulation of a few kHz observed in the
original experiment with He-Ne masers. However, if such enhancement would not
be confirmed by new and more precise data, the existence of a preferred frame
can be definitely ruled out.

concentrations in sea water have been performed at four locations (cities of
Rovinj, Rijeka, Split and Dubrovnik) along the Croatian coast of the Adriatic
sea. In addition, fallout samples were collected in the city of Zadar. 90Sr
activity concentrations are in good correlation with the fallout activity, the
coefficient of correlation being 0.72. After the nuclear moratorium on
atmospheric nuclear bomb tests in 1960s, 90Sr activity concentrations in sea
water exponentially dropped from 14.8 +/- 2.4 Bq/m3 in 1963 to 2.0 +/- 0.3
Bq/m3 in 2003. In the same period, the total annual 90Sr land surface deposit
in Zadar fell by three orders of magnitude, from 713.3 Bq/m2 in 1963 to 0.4
Bq/m2 in 2003. Using strontium sea water and fallout data, a mathematical model
was developed to describe the rate of change of 90Sr activity concentrations in
the Adriatic sea water and estimate its mean residence time in the Adriatic. By
fitting the experimental data to a theoretically predicted curve, the mean
residence time of 90Sr in the Adriatic sea water was estimated to be
approximately 3.4 +/- 0.4 years, standard deviation being calculated by Monte
Carlo simulations. As in physical oceanography 90Sr can be used as effective
radioactive tracer of water mass transport, this value also reflects the upper
limit for turnover time of the Adriatic sea water. The turnover time of 3.4
years for the Adriatic sea water is in reasonable agreement with the value
which was estimated, by studying water flows through the Strait of Otranto, to
be on the order of 1 year.

specific binding of mRNA to DNA oligonucleotide probes and its measurement
using fluorescent labels. The binding of RNA fragments involving other
sequences than the intended target is problematic because it adds a ""chemical
background"" to the signal, which is not related to the expression degree of the
target gene. The paper presents a molecular signature of specific and non
specific hybridization with potential consequences for gene expression
analysis. We analyzed the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch
(MM) probes of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and non
specific hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different
relations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle base of
the PMs, namely a triplet- (C>G=T>A>0) and a duplet-like (C=T>0>G=A) pattern of
the PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of specific and non specific
RNA fragments, respectively. The systematic behaviour of the intensity
difference can be rationalized on the level of base pairings of DNA/RNA
oligonucleotide duplexes in the middle of the probe sequence. Non-specific
binding is characterized by the reversal of the central Watson Crick (WC)
pairing for each PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the
combination of a WC and a self complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes,
respectively. The intensity of complementary MM introduces a systematic source
of variation which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the
MM intensities.

two-dimension to against this adiabatic decoherence.To carry out the analytic
