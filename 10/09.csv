Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. Here, a Linear Accelerating
Superluminal Motion (LASM) model is proposed to interpret the observed
phenomena. The model provides a direct and accurate way to estimate the viewing
angle of a relativistic jet. It also predicts that both Doppler boosting and
deboosting effects may take place in an accelerating forward jet. The LASM
model is applied to the data of the quasar 3C 273, and the initial velocity,
acceleration and viewing angle of its three components are derived through
model fits. The variations of the viewing angle suggest that a supermassive
black hole binary system may exist in the center of 3C273. The gap between the
inner and outer jet in some radio loud AGNs my be explained in terms of Doppler
deboosting effects when the components accelerate to ultra-relativistic speed.

the v=1 masers and 8.8 mas for the v=2 masers. The velocity structure of the
SiO masers appears to be random with no significant indication of global

in the disk atmosphere resulting from the photon bubble instability (PBI) can
cause rapid changes in the X-ray reflection features, even when the
illuminating flux is constant. Using a simulation of the development of the
PBI, we find that, for the disk parameters chosen, the Fe K and O VIII Ly\alpha
lines vary on timescales as short as a few hundredths of an orbital time. In
response to the changes in accretion disk structure, the Fe K equivalent width
(EW) shows variations as large as ~100 eV. The magnitude and direction
(positive or negative) of the changes depends on the ionization state of the
atmosphere. The largest changes are found when the disk is moderately ionized.
The O VIII EW varies by tens of eV, as well as exhibiting plenty of rapid,
low-amplitude changes. This effect provides a natural explanation for some
observed instances of short timescale Fe K variability which was uncorrelated
with the continuum (e.g., Mrk 841). New predictions for Fe K reverberation

a very luminous core, and has been suggested to host a super-star cluster
(SSC). Our observations show that it contains three R136-class clusters
superposed on a bright stellar background in a small region. This tight group
of clusters may dynamically evolve into an SSC in the future, and may appear
unresolved and be identified as an SSC at large distances, but at present
NGC5461 has no SSCs. NGC5462 has loosely distributed HII regions and clusters
without a prominent core. It has the largest number of cluster candidates among
the three GHRs, but most of them are faint and older than 10 Myr. NGC5471 has
multiple bright HII regions, and contains a large number of faint clusters
younger than 5 Myr. Two of the clusters in NGC5471 are older than R136, but
just as luminous; they may be the most massive clusters in the three GHRs. The
fraction of stars formed in massive clusters is estimated from the clusters'
contribution to the total stellar continuum emission and a comparison of the
ionizing power of the clusters to the ionizing requirement of the associated
HII regions. Both estimates show that <~ 50% of massive stars are formed in
massive clusters. The cluster luminosity functions (CLFs) of the three GHRs
show different slopes. NGC5462 has the steepest CLF and the most loosely
distributed interstellar gas, qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that
massive clusters are formed in high-pressure interstellar environments.

major elements (Fe, Mg, Si) of chondrites that admits the possibility that
ordinary chondrite meteorites are derived from two components, a relatively
oxidized and undifferentiated, primitive component and a somewhat
differentiated, planetary component, with oxidation state like the highly
reduced enstatite chondrites, which I suggested was identical to Mercury's
complement of lost elements. Subsequently, on the basis of that relationship, I
derived expressions, as a function of the mass of planet Mercury and the mass
of its core, to estimate the mass of Mercury's lost elements, the mass of
Mercury's alloy and rock protoplanetary core, and the mass of Mercury's gaseous
protoplanet. Here, on the basis of the supposition that Mercury's complement of
lost elements is in fact identical to the planetary component of ordinary
chondrite formation, I estimate, as a function of Mercury's core mass, the
total mass of ordinary chondrite matter originally present in the Solar System.
Although Mercury's mass is well known, its core mass is not, being widely
believed to be in the range of 70 to 80 percent of the planet mass. For a core
mass of 75 percent, the calculated total mass of ordinary chondrite matter
originally present in the Solar System amounts to 1.83E24 kg, about 5.5 times
the mass of Mercury. That amount of mass is insufficient in itself to form a
planet as massive as the Earth, but may have contributed significantly to the
formation of Mars, as well as adding to the veneer of other planets, including
the Earth. Presently, only about 0.1 percent of that mass remains in the

synchrotron radio/sub-mm emission of 100 MeV electrons emanates from an
inefficiently radiating turbulent magnetized corona within 20 Schwarzschild
radii of the GCBH. These electrons are accelerated through second-order Fermi
processes by MHD turbulence. Closer to the innermost stable orbit of the ADAF,
instabilities and shocks within the flow inject power-law electrons through
first-order Fermi acceleration to make synchrotron X-ray flares observed with
Chandra, XMM, and INTEGRAL. A subrelativistic MHD wind subtending a 1sr cone
with power > 10^{37} erg/s is driven by the ADAF from the vicinity of the GCBH.
As in pulsar powered plerions, electrons are accelerated at the wind
termination shock, at > 10^{16.5} cm from the GCBH, and Compton-scatter the
ADAF and the far infra-red (FIR) dust radiation to TeV energies. The
synchrotron radiation of these electrons forms the quiescent X-ray source

represents a paradigmatic example of this class of systems. The equilibrium
properties of the model can be derived analytically in the canonical ensemble:
in particular the model shows a second order phase transition from a
ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase. Strong anomalies are observed in the
process of relaxation towards equilibrium for a particular class of
out-of-equilibrium initial conditions. In fact the numerical simulations show
the presence of quasi-stationary state (QSS), i.e. metastable states which
become stable if the thermodynamic limit is taken before the infinite time
limit. The QSS differ strongly from
  Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium states: they exhibit negative specific heat,
vanishing Lyapunov exponents and weak mixing, non-Gaussian velocity
distributions and anomalous diffusion, slowly-decaying correlations and aging.
Such a scenario provides strong hints for the possible application of Tsallis
generalized thermostatistics. The QSS have been recently interpreted as a
spin-glass phase of the model. This link indicates another promising line of
research, which is not alternative to the previous one.

it numerically, we demonstrate the inapplicability of standard
weak-coupling-based vdW interaction models in a close vicinity of the CN
surface where the local photonic DOS effectively increases, giving rise to an
atom-field coupling enhancement. An inside encapsulation of atoms into the CN
has been shown to be energetically more favorable than their outside adsorption
by the CN surface. If the atom is fixed outside the CN, the modulus of the vdW
energy increases with the CN radius provided that the weak atom-field coupling
regime is realized (i.e., far enough from the CN). For inside atomic position,
the modulus of the vdW energy decreases with the CN radius, representing a
general effect of the effective interaction area reduction with lowering the CN
curvature.

formulated in an attempt to investigate diffusion phenomena. We imagine a
regular dynamical hamiltonian systems under the random perturbation of thermal
(molecular) noise and chaotic motion. The random effect is taken into account
via the uncertainty of irregular dynamic process produced in this way. This
uncertainty due to different paths between two phase points is measured by a
path information which is maximized in connection with the action defined
originally for the unperturbed regular hamiltonian systems. The obtained
transition probability depends exponentially on this action. The usefulness of
this information method has been demonstrated by the derivation of diffusion
laws without the usual assumptions. In this work, some essential mathematical
aspects of this irregular dynamics is reviewed. It is emphasized that the
classical action principle for single least action path is no more valid and
the formalism of classical mechanics for regular hamiltonian systems is no more
exact for irregular hamiltonian dynamics. There is violation of the fundamental
laws of mechanics by randomly perturbed hamiltonian systems. However, the
action principle is always present for the ensemble of paths through the
average action. This average action principle leads to a formalism of
stochastic mechanics in which, in spite of the violation of fundamental laws,
the mathematical form of classical mechanics can be recovered by a
consideration of the statistical averaging of the dynamics.

gas of Fermi atoms with a Feshbach resonance. A tunable pairing interaction
associated with the Feshbach resonance leads to the BCS-BEC crossover, where
the character of superfluidity continuously changes from the BCS-type to a BEC
of composite bosons. In this paper, we extend our previous work for a uniform
superfluid Fermi gas [Y. Ohashi and A. Griffin, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 67}, 063612
(2003)] to include the effect of a harmonic trap. We directly solve the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes coupled equations, and find self-consistent values for the
spatially-dependent local density $n({\bf r})$ as well as the composite BCS
order parameter ${\tilde \Delta}({\bf r})$. Using these results, we calculate
the single-particle density of states in the crossover region, and from this
determine the true single-particle energy gap ($E_{\rm g}$) of the trapped
Fermi superfluid at T=0. This is associated with the in-gap (or Andreev) states
in the low density region at the edge of the trap. We calculate the
laser-induced current $I(\omega)$, as measured in recent rf-spectroscopy
experiments. We show how the high-energy part of $I(\omega)$ gives information
about ${\tilde \Delta}(r=0)$ at the center of the trap. We emphasize that the
narrow ""unpaired atom"" peak in the rf-data gives information about $E_g$ and
the low-energy in-gap states of a Fermi superfluid. While our calculations are
limited at T=0, we use them to discuss the recent Innsbruck data and the LDA

magnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP
dipoles. The relationship between the fields measured by the probes and the
beam energy is defined in the NMR model, which is calibrated against precise
measurements of the average beam energy between 41 and 61 GeV made using the

three independent methods: the flux-loop, which is sensitive to the bending
field of all the dipoles of LEP; the spectrometer, which determines the energy
through measurements of the deflection of the beam in a magnet of known
integrated field; and an analysis of the variation of the synchrotron tune with
the total RF voltage. To obtain the centre-of-mass energies, corrections are
then applied to account for sources of bending field external to the dipoles,
and variations in the local beam energy at each interaction point. The relative

CP violation required for electroweak baryogenesis. By constructing appropriate
projectors in flavor space of the relevant tree level Kadanoff-Baym equations,
we split the constraint equations into ""diagonal"" and ""transversal"" parts in
flavor space, and show that they decouple. While the diagonal densities exhibit
standard dispersion relations at leading order in gradients, the transverse
densities exhibit a novel on-shell structure. Next, the kinetic equations are
considered to second order in gradients and the CP-violating source terms are
isolated. This requires a thorough discussion of a flavor independent
definition of charge-parity symmetry operation. To make a link with
baryogenesis in the supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, we
construct the Green functions for the leading order kinetic operator and solve
the kinetic equations for two mixing fermions (charginos). We take account of
flavor blind damping, and consider the cases of inefficient and moderate
diffusion. The resulting densities are the CP-violating chargino currents that
source baryogenesis.

temperature and the expansion velocity values are consistent with the values
previously derived from fitting single hadron inclusive data. As a function of
transverse momentum the collisions scaled peripheral.to.central yield ratio RCP
for the is comparable to that of pions rather than that of protons. This result
lends support to theoretical models which distinguish between baryons and
mesons instead of particle mass for explaining the anomalous proton yield.

exchange amplitude and is zero in the one-photon exchange approximation. From
comparison with theoretical estimates of A$_\perp$ we conclude that
$\pi$N-intermediate states give a substantial contribution to the imaginary
part of the two-photon amplitude. The contribution from the ground state proton
to the imaginary part of the two-photon exchange can be neglected. There is no
obvious reason why this should be different for the real part of the two-photon
amplitude, which enters into the radiative corrections for the Rosenbluth
separation measurements of the electric form factor of the proton.

at RHIC implies an elliptic flow of similar magnitude for charm quarks, at
moderately large pT > 2.5 - 3 GeV. At lower transverse momenta, charm quark
elliptic flow reduces progressively, reminiscent of the mass ordering pattern
in ideal hydrodynamics. From the quark flows we predict the elliptic flow of D
mesons at RHIC via quark coalescence. The large parton opacities needed to
generate the light quark flow also lead to substantial ~40-50% secondary charm
production.

aberrations and an identification of each of its elements' contribution to the
overall aberration figures. The matrix formalism developed by one of the
authors was the object of a previous paper and allows the expression of
image-space coordinates as high-order polynomials of object-space coordinates.
In this paper we approach the question of aberrations, both through the
evaluation of the wavefront evolution along the system and its departure from
the ideal spherical shape and the use of ray density plots. Using seventh-order
matrix modeling, we can calculate the optical path between any two points of a
ray as it travels along the optical system and we define the wavefront as the
locus of the points with any given optical path; the results are presented on
the form of traces of the wavefront on the tangential plane, although the
formalism would also permit sagital plane plots. Ray density plots are obtained
by actual derivation of the seventh-order polynomials.

  instabilities in dipole magnetospheric plasmas with anisotropic temperature","12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25-29 October 2004,
  Nice (France)",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  In this paper, we derive the dispersion equations for field-aligned cyclotron
waves in an axisymmetric dipole magnetospheric plasmas with both the
bi-Maxwellian and bi-Lorentzian distribution functions. To evaluate the
contribution of trapped particles to the transverse current density components
the Vlasov equation is solved using a standard method of switching to new
variables associated with conservation integrals; new time-like variable is
introduced (instead of the geomagnetic latitude angle) to describe the
bounce-motion of trapped particles along the geomagnetic field; the perturbed
electric field and current density components are Fourier-decomposed over the
length of the geomagnetic field lines. As a result, the transverse permittivity
elements are expressed by summation of bounce-resonant terms including the
double integration in velocity space, the resonant denominators, and the
corresponding phase coefficients. Due to geomagnetic field nonuniformity, the
wave-particle resonance conditions in magnetospheric plasmas are entirely
different from ones in the straight magnetic field; the all spectrum of the
electric field is present in the given current density harmonic; the left- and
right-hand polarized waves are coupled. To have some analogy with the linear
theory of cyclotron waves in the straight magnetic field, we assume that the
n-th harmonic of the electric field gives the main contribution to the n-th
harmonic of the current density, and the connection of the left- and right-hand
polarized waves is small. In this case, the dispersion equations for cyclotron
waves have the simplest form and are suitable to analyze the instabilities of
both the electron- and ion-cyclotron waves accounting for the bounce resonance
effects.
