isolated in layers dating from about 3 Myr ago. Since 60Fe has a mean life of
2.2 Myr, a near-Earth supernova is the only likely source for such a signal,
and we explore here the consequences of a supernova origin. We combine the 60Fe
data with several supernova nucleosynthesis models to calculate the supernova
distance as a function of progenitor mass, finding an allowed range of 15-120
pc. We also predict the signals expected for several other radioisotopes, which
are independent of the supernova distance. Species likely to be present near or
above background levels are 10Be, 26Al, 53Mn, 182Hf and 244Pu. Of these, 182Hf
and 244Pu are nearly background-free, presenting the best opportunities to
provide strong confirmation of the supernova origin of the 60Fe signal, and to
demonstrate that at least some supernovae are the source for the r-process. The
accuracies of our predictions are hampered by large uncertainties in the
predicted 60Fe yields for supernovae of different masses, so the new crust data
motivate a redoubled theoretical attack on this problem.

velocity (RV) measurements of the HD160691 (mu Arae). The kinematic,
2-Keplerian model of the measurements leads to the best-fit solution in which
the eccentricity of the outer planet is about 0.7 and its semi-major axis is
about 4AU. The parameters of the inner planet are well determined. The
eccentricity is about 0.3 and the semi-major axis is about 1.65AU. The best
2-Keplerian model leads to a catastrophically unstable configuration, self
disrupting in less than 20,000yr. To derive dynamically stable configurations
which are simultaneously consistent with the RV data, we use the so called GAMP
(Genetic Algorithm with MEGNO Penalty). Using this method, we derive meaningful
limits on the parameters of the outer planet which provide a stable behavior of
the system. The best-fit solutions are located in a shallow valley of Chi^2, in
the (a_c,e_c)-plane, extending over 2AU (for the formal 1sigma confidence
interval of the best fit). We find two equally good best-fit solutions leading
to the qualitatively different orbital configurations. One of them corresponds
to the center of the 5:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) and the second one
describes a configuration between the 6:1 and 17:2MMRs. The mu Arae system can
be found in the zone confined to other low-order MMRs of the type p:1 with p>5.
Our results support the classification of the mu Arae as a hierarchical
planetary system, dynamically similar to other known multi-planet systems
around HD12661 and HD169830. The results of the GAMP on the extended data set
are fully consistent with our previous conclusions concerning a much shorter
observational window.

modest effect on migration rates since the torques at the midplane are weighted
heavily both because the density and the perturbing potential are maximized at
the midplane. However, temperature perturbations resulting from shadowing and
illumination at the disk's surface can decrease the migration rate by up to
another factor of 2 for planets at the gap-opening threshold at distances where
viscous heating is minimal. This would help to resolve the timescale mismatch
between the standard core-accretion scenario for planet formation and the
survival of planets, and could help explain some of the rich diversity of
planetary systems already observed.

  Journal","Astrophys.J. 617 (2004) 1131-1141","10.1086/425574",,"astro-ph",,"  Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) contain enigmatic sub-micron components
called GEMS (Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulfides). The compositions and
structures of GEMS indicate that they have been processed by exposure to ion-
izing radiation but details of the actual irradiation environment(s) have
remained elusive. Here we propose a mechanism and astrophysical site for GEMS
formation that explains for the first time the following key properties of
GEMS; they are stoichiometrically enriched in oxygen and systematically deple-
ted in S, Mg, Ca and Fe (relative to solar abundances), most have normal
(solar) oxygen isotopic compositions, they exhibit a strikingly narrow size
distribution (0.1-0.5 $\mu$m diameter), and some of them contain ``relict''
crystals within their glass matrices. We show that these properties are incon-
sistent with amorphization by particles accelerated by diffusive shock accel-
eration. Instead, we propose that GEMS are formed from crystalline grains that
condense in outflows from massive stars in OB associations, are accelerated in
encounters with frequent supernova shocks inside the associated superbubble,
and are implanted with atoms from the hot gas in the SB interior. We thus rev-
erse the usual roles of target and projectile. Rather than being bombarded at
rest by energetic ions, grains are accelerated and bombarded by a nearly mono-
velocity beam of atoms as viewed in their rest frame. Meyer, Drury and Ellison
have proposed that galactic cosmic rays originate from ions sputtered from such
accelerated dust grains. We suggest that GEMS are surviving members of a pop-
ulation of fast grains that constitute the long-sought source material for gal-
actic cosmic rays. Thus, representatives of the GCR source material may have
been awaiting discovery in cosmic dust labs for the last thirty years.

on nitrogen without high carbon dioxide abundance so that early life need not
have been as UV-resistant as often assumed. An extrasolar planet with a

same, or nearly four times higher (depending upon the O2 partial pressure) when
CO2 is used in place of N2 as the replacement component for lowered O2 in a
1-atm terrestrial planet with solar radiation. The effect is important for
making quantitative deductions from future data, but does not invalidate the
use of O3 as a biomarker for free oxygen. These results make prospects for

Transient black hole binaries show no trend in their quiescent X-ray
luminosities as a function of i, suggesting that the radiation is not
significantly beamed. This is consistent with emission from an accretion disk.
If the X-rays are from a jet, then the Lorentz factor gamma of the jet is less
than 1.24 at the 90% confidence level. (2) The X-ray binary 4U1543-47 with i of
order 21 degrees has a surprisingly strong fluorescent iron line in the high
soft state. Quantifying an earlier argument by Park et al. (2004), we conclude
that if the continuum X-ray emission in this source is from a jet, then gamma <
1.04. (3) None of the known binaries has cos i < 0.25 or i > 75 degrees. This
fact, plus the lack of eclipses among the 20 black hole binaries in our sample,
strongly suggests at the 99.5% confidence level that systems with large
inclination angles are hidden from view. The obscuration could be the result of
disk flaring, as suggested by Milgrom (1978) for neutron star X-ray binaries.
(4) Transient black hole binaries with i ~ 70-75 degrees have significantly
more complex X-ray light curves than systems with i < 65 degrees. This may be
the result of variable obscuration and/or variable height above the disk of the
radiating gas.

Carlo simulation and the analytical ring approximation. The calculated
order-disorder temperature for bulk (1495-1514 K) was in relatively good
agreement (4% error) with the experimental value (1572K). For nanoparticles of
finite size, the (long range) order parameter changed continuously from unity
to zero with increasing temperature. Rather than a discontinuity indicative of
a phase transition we obtained an inflection point in the order as a function
of temperature. This inflection point occurred at a temperature below the bulk
phase transition temperature and which decreased as the particle size
decreased. Our calculations predict that 3.5nm diameter particles in
configurational equilibrium at 600 C (a typical annealing temperature for
promoting L1_0 ordering) have an L1_0 order parameter of 0.83 (compared to a
maximum possible value equal to unity). According to our investigations, the

time at an aging temperature in many cases. An increase in the dielectric
constant was also observed in the long time region ($\ge$11h) near the glass
transition temperature for thin films with thickness less than 26nm. In the
constant rate mode including a temporary stop at a temperature $T_a$, the
memory of the aging at $T_a$ was found to be kept and then to be recalled
during the subsequent heating process. In the negative temperature cycling
process, a strong rejuvenation effect has been observed after the temperature
shift from the initial temperature $T_1$ to the second temperature
$T_2$($=T_1+\Delta T$) when $\Delta T\approx -20$K. Furthermore, a full memory
effect has also been observed for the temperature shift from $T_2$ to $T_1$.
This suggests that the aging at $T_1$ is totally independent of that at $T_2$
for $\Delta T\approx -20$K. As $|\Delta T|$ decreases, the independence of the
aging between the two temperatures was found to be weaken, $i.e.,$ the
effective time, which is a measure of the contribution of the aging at $T_1$ to
that at $T_2$, is a decreasing function of $|\Delta T|$ in the negative region
of $\Delta T$. As the film thickness decreases from 514nm to 26nm, the $|\Delta
T|$ dependence of the effective time was found to become much stronger. The
contribution of the aging at $T_2$ to that at $T_1$ disappears more rapidly
with increasing $|\Delta T|$ in thin film geometry than in the bulk state.

the well known decrease of the orbital period due to gravitational wave
emission, as a further post-Keplerian parameter in binary systems including one
pulsar is examined. The resulting effect is almost three times larger than the
periastron advance \dot\omega. E.g., for the recently discovered double pulsar
system PSR J0737-3039 A+B it would amount to -47.79 deg yr^-1. This implies
that it could be extracted from the linear part of a quadratic fit of the
orbital phase because the uncertainties both in the linear drift due to the

smaller. The availability of such additional post-Keplerian parameter would be
helpful in further constraining the General Theory of Relativity, especially
for such systems in which some of the other post-Keplerian parameters can be
measured with limited accuracy. Moreover, also certain pulsar-white dwarf

while the recursion operators that generate them usually contain nonlocal
terms. We resolve this apparent discrepancy by providing simple and universal
sufficient conditions for a (nonlocal) recursion operator in (1+1) dimensions
to generate a hierarchy of local symmetries. These conditions are satisfied by
virtually all known today recursion operators and are much easier to verify
than those found in earlier work.
  We also give explicit formulas for the nonlocal parts of higher recursion
operators, Poisson and symplectic structures of integrable systems in (1+1)
dimensions.
  Using these two results we prove, under some natural assumptions, the
Maltsev--Novikov conjecture stating that higher Hamiltonian, symplectic and
recursion operators of integrable systems in (1+1) dimensions are weakly
nonlocal, i.e., the coefficients of these operators are local and these
operators contain at most one integration operator in each term.

space and fusion plasmas. There are a few experimental researches on production
and control of a fast flowing plasma in spite of a growing significance in the
magnetized-plasma flow dynamics. A magneto-plasma-dynamic arcjet (MPDA) is one
of promising devices to produce a supersonic plasma flow and has been utilized
as an electric propulsion device with a higher specific impulse and a
relatively larger thrust. We have improved the performance of an MPDA to
produce a quasi-steady plasma flow with a transonic and supersonic Mach number
in a highly-ionized state. There are two methods in order to control an
ion-acoustic Mach number of the plasma flow exhausted from an MPDA: one is to
use a magnetic Laval nozzle to convert a thermal energy to a flow energy and
the other is a combined system of an ion heating and a divergent magnetic
nozzle. The former is an analogous method to a compressible air flow and the
latter is the method proposed in an advanced thruster for a manned
interplanetary space mission. We have clarified the plasma flow characteristics
in various shapes of a magnetic field configuration. It was demonstrated that
the Mach number of the plasma flow could increase up to almost 3 in a divergent
magnetic nozzle field. This paper reports recent results on the flow field
improvements: one is on a magnetic-Laval-nozzle effects observed at the muzzle
region of the MPDA, and the other is on ICRF (ion-cyclotron-range of frequency)
heating of a supersonic plasma by use of a helical antenna.

with coherent mode in several kHz is excited in the hot-ion mode plasma. When
the ECRH is applied, electron density in the central cell increases gradually.
On the contrary, intensity of the density fluctuation decreases and coherent
mode is suppressed. Its frequency also varies with the density increase. In
that time, radial potential distribution, i.e., electric field, changes along
with the formation of plug potential. From this behaviour it is deduced that

  added",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.71.032342",,"quant-ph",,"  We study a continuous-variable (CV) teleportation protocol based on a shared
entangled state produced by the quantum-nondemolition (QND) interaction of two
vacuum states. The scheme utilizes the QND interaction or an unbalanced beam
splitter in the Bell measurement. It is shown that in the non-unity gain regime
the signal transfer coefficient can be enhanced while the conditional variance
product remains preserved by applying appropriate local squeezing operation on
sender's part of the shared entangled state. In the unity gain regime it is
demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation can be increased with the help
of the local squeezing operations on parts of the shared entangled state that
convert effectively our scheme to the standard CV teleportation scheme.
Further, it is proved analytically that such a choice of the local symplectic
operations minimizes the noise by which the mean number of photons in the input
state is increased during the teleportation. Finally, our analysis reveals that
the local symplectic operation on sender's side can be integrated into the Bell
measurement if the interaction constant of the interaction in the Bell
measurement can be adjusted properly.

  Extreme Localization","RevTeX4, 4 pages, more references and some rewriting. Title changed",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Due to its connection to the diffeomorphism group, nonlinear quantum
mechanics may play an important role in quantum geometry. The Doebner-Goldin
nonlinearity (arising from representations of the diffeomorphism group)
amplifies nonlocal signaling effects under extreme localization, suggesting
that even if greatly suppressed at low energies, such effects may be
significant at the Planck scale. This offers new perspectives on Planck-scale
physics.
