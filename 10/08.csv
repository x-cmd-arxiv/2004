in containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range of

the luminosity function as well as the broad-band properties of low luminosity

parameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in the
slope at low luminosities. The resulting slope at low luminosities in this

galaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection
effects, and we estimate that the true low luminosity slope may be as steep or
steeper than -1.5. The results here are consistent with previous SDSS results
and, in the g-band, roughly consistent with the results of the Two degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey. Extremely low luminosity galaxies are predominantly
blue, low surface brightness, exponential disks.

continuously with the expansion of the universe. We show how neutrino flavor
conversion in this way can leave both the active and sterile neutrinos with
non-thermal energy spectra, and how, in turn, these distorted energy spectra

the existence of a light sterile neutrino which mixes with active neutrinos can

one being a QSO as indicated by the broadness of its emission line. The
velocity dispersion of the emitters (360 km/s) is significantly smaller than
that of the narrow band filter used for their selection (1600 km/s). We
therefore conclude that the emitters are associated with the radio galaxy. The
star formation rates (SFRs) deduced from the H-alpha flux are in the range 6-44
M_solar/yr and the SFR density observed is 5-10 times higher than in the HDF-N

0.03 mag). These differences are smaller than the scatter among other models in

strong indications that the delayed neutrino mechanism works combined with a

need to provide correct nucleosynthesis abundances for the progressing field of
galactic evolution and observations of low metallicity stars. The innermost
ejecta is directly affected by the explosion mechanism, i.e. most strongly the
yields of Fe-group nuclei for which an induced piston or thermal bomb treatment
will not provide the correct yields because the effect of neutrino interactions
is not included. We apply parameterized variations to the neutrino scattering
cross sections and alternatively, parameterized variations are applied to the
neutrino absorption cross sections on nucleons in the ``gain region''. We find
that both measures lead to similar results, causing explosions and a Ye>0.5 in
the innermost ejected layers, due to the combined effect of a short weak
interaction time scale and a negligible electron degeneracy, unveiling the
proton-neutron mass difference. We include all weak interactions (electron and
positron capture, beta-decay, neutrino and antineutrino capture on nuclei, and
neutrino and antineutrino capture on nucleons) and present first
nucleosynthesis results for these innermost ejected layers to discuss how they
improve predictions for Fe-group nuclei. The proton-rich environment results in

galaxies. Using our models of absorption line indices that account for variable
abundance ratios, we derive the stellar population parameters of 124 early-type

parameters age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio are correlated with velocity
dispersion. We further find evidence for an influence of the environment on the
stellar population properties. Massive early-type galaxies in low-density
environments appear on average ~2 Gyrs younger and slightly more metal-rich
than their counterparts in high density environments. No offsets in the
alpha/Fe ratios, instead, are detected. We translate the derived ages and
alpha/Fe ratios into star formation histories. We show that most star formation
activity in early-type galaxies is expected to have happened between redshifts
3 and 5 in high density and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low density
environments. We conclude that at least 50 per cent of the total stellar mass
density must have already formed at z 1, in good agreement with observational
estimates of the total stellar mass density as a function of redshift. Our
results suggest that significant mass growth in the early-type galaxy
population below z 1 must be restricted to less massive objects, and a
significant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2
should be present caused mainly by the field galaxy population. The results of
this paper further imply vigorous star formation episodes in massive objects at
z 2-5 and the presence of evolved ellipticals around z 1, both observationally
identified as SCUBA galaxies and EROs.

numerical simulations. Since these simulations are unable to resolve regions
very near the halo center, the extrapolation of the fitting formula leads to a
spherically averaged ""universal'' density profile that diverges at the origin.
We remove this inconvenient feature by replacing a small central region of the
NFW halo with an interior Schwarzschild solution with constant density,
continuously matched to the remaining NFW spacetime. A model of a single halo,
as an isolated object with finite mass, follows by smoothly matching the NFW
spacetime to a Schwarzschild vacuum exterior along the virial radius, the
physical ""cut-off'' customarily imposed, as the mass associated with NFW
profiles diverges asymptotically. Numerical simulations assume weakly
interacting collisionless particles, hence we suggest that NFW halos
approximately satisfy an ""ideal gas'' type of equation of state, where
mass-density is the dominant rest--mass contribution to matter--energy, with
the internal energy contribution associated with an anisotropic kinetic
pressure. We show that, outside the central core, this pressure and the mass
density roughly satisfy a polytropic relation. Since stellar polytropes are the
equilibrium configurations in Tsallis' non-extensive formalism of Statistical
Mechanics, we argue that NFW halos might provide a rough empirical estimate of
the free parameter $q$ of Tsallis' formalism.

data were modeled with linear combinations of single-age stellar population
synthesis models. The large majority (~80%) of the surveyed nuclei have spectra
whose features are consistent with a predominantly old (>5x10^9 yr) stellar
population. Approximately 25% of these nuclei show evidence of a component with
age younger than 1 Gyr, with the incidence of these stars related to the

corresponding to A_V~0.4 mag and stellar metallicity of (1--2.5) Z_sun. We
discuss the implications of these results for the understanding of star
formation history in the environment of quiescent and active supermassive black

braneworld models of dark energy which, in addition to being spatially flat,
also accelerate at late times. Loitering is characterized by the fact that the
Hubble parameter dips in value over a narrow redshift range which we shall
refer to as the `loitering epoch'. During loitering, density perturbations are
expected to grow rapidly. In addition, since the expansion of the universe
slows down, its age near loitering dramatically increases. An early epoch of
loitering is expected to boost the formation of high redshift gravitationally
bound systems such as $10^9 M_\odot$ black holes at $z \sim 6$ and lower-mass
black holes and/or Population III stars at $z > 10$, whose existence could be
problematic within the LCDM scenario. Loitering models also help to reduce the
redshift of reionization from its currently (high) value of $z_{\rm reion}
\simeq 17$ in LCDM cosmology, thus alleviating a significant source of tension
between observations of the high-redshift universe and theoretical model
building. Currently a loitering universe accelerates with an effective equation
of state $w < -1$ thus mimicking phantom dark energy. Unlike phantom, however,
the late-time expansion of the universe in our model is singularity free, and a
universe that loitered in the past will approach a LCDM model asymptotically in
the distant future.

period is consistently detected at P~83.38min, ~2.8% longer than the orbital
period, which we tentatively relate to the presence of permanent superhumps.
High time resolution photometry exhibits short-timescale variability on time
scales of 5-6min which we interpret as non-radial white dwarf pulsations, as
well as a coherent signal at 1.12min, which is likely to be the white dwarf
spin period. A large-amplitude quasi-sinusoidal radial velocity modulation of
the Balmer and Helium lines with a period ~3.5h is persistently detected
throughout three seasons of time-resolved spectroscopy. However, this
spectroscopic period, which is in no way related to the orbital period, is not
strictly coherent but drifts in period and/or phase on time scales of a few
days. Modeling the far-ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution of
HS2331+3905, we determine a white dwarf temperature of Teff=10500K (assuming
Mwd=0.6Msun), close to the ZZ Ceti instability strip of single white dwarfs.
The spectral model implies a distance of d=90+-15pc, and a low value for the
distance is supported by the large proper motion of the system, mu=0.14""/yr.

methods: one based on the energy integral, which allows the determination of a
sufficient condition of stability, one using a WKB approach, which allows the
determination of the necessary and sufficient condition for instability and a
last one by numerical solution. This linear instability occurs in any inviscid
stably stratified differential rotating fluid for rigid, stress-free or
periodic boundary conditions, provided the angular velocity $\Omega$ decreases
outwards with radius $r$. At not too small stratification, its growth rate is a
fraction of $\Omega$. The influence of viscous dissipation and thermal
diffusivity on the instability is studied numerically, with emphasis on the
case when $d \ln \Omega / d \ln r =-3/2$ (Keplerian case). Strong
stratification and large diffusivity are found to have a stabilizing effect.
The corresponding critical stratification and Reynolds number for the onset of
the instability in a typical disk are derived. We propose that the spontaneous
generation of these linear modes is the source of turbulence in disks,

profiles with the Sersic r^(1/n) model of light distribution. We confirm the
result of Graham & Guzman (2003) that the apparent dichotomy between E and dE
galaxies in the luminosity-<mu>_e plane no longer appears when other structural
parameters are considered and can be entirely attributed to the onset of ""core""
galaxies at B_T sim -20.5 mag. When ""core"" galaxies are not considered, E and
dE form a unique family with n linearly increasing with the luminosity. For 90
galaxies we analyze the B-I color indices, both in the nuclear and in the outer
regions. Both indices are bluer toward fainter luminosities. We find also that
the outer color gradients do not show any significant correlation with the
luminosity. The scatter in all color indicators increases significantly toward
lower luminosities, e.g. galaxies fainter than B_T sim -15 have a B-I spread
0.5 mag.

0.17'' x 0.13'' (~1 kpc), and enable us to resolve the molecular gas emission
both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in J1148+5251 is extended to
a radius of 2.5 kpc, and the central region shows 2 peaks, separated by 0.3''
(1.7 kpc). These peaks account for about half of the total emission, while the
remainder is more extended. Each of these unresolved peaks contains a molecular
gas mass of ~5 x 10^9 M_sun (similar to the total mass found in nearby ULIRGS)
and has an intrinsic brightness temperature of ~35 K (averaged over the 1
kpc-sized beam), comparable to what is found in nearby starburst centers.
Assuming that the molecular gas is gravitationally bound, we estimate a
dynamical mass of ~4.5 x 10^10 M_sun within a radius of 2.5 kpc (~5.5 x 10^10
M_sun if corrected for a derived inclination of i~65 deg.). This dynamical mass
estimate leaves little room for matter other than the detected molecular gas,
and in particular the data are inconsistent with a ~10^12 M_sun stellar bulge
which would be predicted based on the M_BH-sigma_bulge relation. This finding
may indicate that black holes form prior to the assembly of the stellar bulges
and that the dark matter halos are less massive than predicted based on the
black hole/bulge mass relationship.

(period: 0.172 d) with a very strong reflection effect, but no eclipses. The
reflection is stronger than in any of the other similar systems which renders a
quantitative spectral analysis very difficult because the Balmer line profiles
may be disturbed by the reflected light. A spectroscopic analysis results in
Teff = 36500 K, log g = 5.70, and log (n_He/n_H) = -2.15. Mass-radius relations
were derived from the results of the analysis of light and radial-velocity

gravity of the sdB star favours a rather low mass of 0.38 Msun for the primary.
The mass of the companion is 0.29 M_sun. HS 2333+3927 is the only known sdB+dM

particles of the fluid mixture into the inhomogeneous system. The approach is
illustrated by the determination of the equation of state of a simple,
truncated Lennard--Jones fluid and the analysis of the behavior of this fluid
near a hard wall. The wall--fluid integral equation exhibits complete drying
and the corresponding coexisting densities are in good agreement with those
obtained from the standard (Maxwell) construction applied to the bulk fluid.
Self--consistency of the approach is examined by analyzing the
virial/compressibility routes to the equation of state and the Gibbs--Duhem
relation for the bulk fluid, and the contact density sum rule and the Gibbs
adsorption equation for the hard wall problem. For the bulk fluid, we find good
self--consistency for stable states outside the critical region. For the hard

coexistence where the adsorption is large.For the contact density sum rule, we
find some deviationsnear coexistence due to a slight disagreement between the

of energy gaps or critical points (van Hove singularities) of the optical

observing the dependence of such spectra on isotopic mass whenever different
stable isotopes of a given atom are available at affordable prices. In crystals
composed of different atoms, the effect of the vibration of each separate atom
can thus be investigated by isotopic substitution. Because of the zero-point
vibrations, such effects are present even at zero temperature (T = 0). In this
paper we discuss state-of-the-art calculations of the dielectric function
spectra and compare them with experimental results, with emphasis on the
differences introduced by the electron-phonon interaction. The temperature
dependence of various optical parameters will be described by means of one or
two (in a few cases three) Einstein oscillators, except at the lowest
temperatures where the T4 law (contrary to the Varshini T2 result) will be
shown to apply. Increasing an isotopic mass increases the energy gaps, except
in the case of monovalent Cu (e.g., CuCl) and possibly Ag (e.g., AgGaS2). It
will be shown that the gaps of tetrahedral materials containing an element of
the first row of the periodic table (C,N,O) are strongly affected by the
electron-phonon interaction. It will be conjectured that this effect is related
to the superconductivity recently observed in heavily boron-doped carbon.

social psychology literature. We argue that a good candidate to model this
phenomenon can be a new variant of the bounded confidence (BC) model, the
smooth BC model which we propose in this paper. This model considers
individuals with a continuous opinion and an uncertainty. Individuals interact
by random pairs, and attract each other&#8217;s opinion proportionally to a
Gaussian function of the distance between their opinions. We first show that
this model presents a shift to the extreme when we introduce extremists (very
convinced individuals with extreme opinions) in the population, even if there
is the same number of extremists located at each extreme. This behaviour is
similar to the one already identified with other versions of BC model. Then we
propose a modification of the smooth BC model to account for the social
psychology data and theories related to this phenomenon. The modification is
based on the hypothesis of perspective taking (empathy) in the context of
consensus seeking.

the co-moving Lagrangian reference frame. The main advantage of the Lagrangian
description of many-body dynamics is that in the co-moving frame the current
density vanishes, while the density of particles becomes independent of time.
Therefore a co-moving observer will see the picture which is very similar to
that seen in the equilibrium system from the laboratory frame. It is shown that
the most natural set of basic variables in TDDFT includes the Lagrangian
coordinate, $\bm\xi$, a symmetric deformation tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, and a
skew-symmetric vorticity tensor, $F_{\mu\nu}$. These three quantities,
respectively, describe the translation, deformation, and the rotation of an
infinitesimal fluid element. Reformulation of TDDFT in terms of new basic
variables resolves the problem of nonlocality and thus allows to regularly
derive a local nonadiabatic approximation for exchange correlation (xc)
potential. Stationarity of the density in the co-moving frame makes the
derivation to a large extent similar to the derivation of the standard static
local density approximation. We present a few explicit examples of nonlinear
nonadiabatic xc functionals in a form convenient for practical applications.

system. Thus the evolution turns into a problem of statistical physics. In the
present work, this problem is treated in the framework of non-equilibrium
statistics. It is proposed that each area-cell possesses the energy like a
microscopic black hole, and has the gravitational interaction with the other
area-cells. We consider both a non-interaction ideal system, and a system with
small nearest-neighbor interactions, and obtain an analytic expression of the
expected value of the horizon area of a dynamical BH. We find that, after a
long enough evolution, a dynamical BH with the Hawking radiation can be in

that, the system has a critical point, and when the temperature of the

are many situations where the effects of gravitation can be described by
formally introducing ""gravito-electric"" and ""gravito-magnetic"" fields, starting
from the corresponding potentials, in analogy with the electromagnetic theory
(see also A. Tartaglia's contribution to these proceedings). The ""many faces of
gravito-electromagnetism"" are related to rotation effects in both approximated
and full theory approaches. Here we show that, by using a 1+3 splitting,
relativistic dynamics can be described in terms of gravito-electromagnetic
(GEM) fields in full theory. On the basis of this formalism, we introduce a
""gravito-magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect"", which allows to interpret some
rotation effects as gravito-magnetic effects. Finally, we suggest a way for
measuring the angular momentum of celestial bodies by studying the
gravito-magnetic effects on the propagation of electromagnetic signals.

  http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca/People/cwlai/papers/papers.html For",,,,"gr-qc",,"  We present a numerical study of general relativistic boson stars in both
spherical symmetry and axisymmetry. We consider both time-independent problems,
involving the solution of equilibrium equations for rotating boson stars, and
time-dependent problems, focusing on black hole critical behaviour associated
with boson stars.
  The study of the critical phenomena that arise at the threshold of black hole
formation has been a subject of intense interest among relativists and applied
mathematicians over the past decade. Type I critical phenomena were previously
observed in the dynamics of spherically symmetric boson stars by Hawley and
Choptuik. We extend this work and show that, contrary to previous claims, the
subcritical end-state is well described by a stable boson star executing a
large amplitude oscillation with a frequency in good agreement with that
predicted for the fundamental normal mode of the end-state star from linear
perturbation theory.
  We then extend our studies of critical phenomena to the axisymmetric case,
studying two distinct classes of parametrized families of initial data whose
evolution generates families of spacetimes that ``interpolate'' between those
than contain a black hole and those that do not. In both cases we find strong
evidence for a Type I transition at threshold, and are able to demonstrate
scaling of the lifetime for near-critical configurations of the type expected
for such a transition. This is the first time that Type I critical solutions
have been simulated in axisymmetry.

couples to an asymptotically free gauge theory, the radiative corrections to
the effective inflaton potential can be anomalously large. This occurs for
small values of the inflaton field which are of the order of the gauge theory
strong coupling scale. Radiative corrections cause the inflaton potential to
blow up at small values of the inflaton field. As a result, these corrections
can violate the slow-roll condition at the initial stage of the inflation and
suppress the production of scalar density perturbations.

length scale, providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff and a limit to the
possible resolution of spacetime.
  Motivated by String Theory, the models of large extra dimensions lower the
Planck scale to values soon accessible. These models predict a vast number of
quantum gravity effects at the lowered Planck scale, among them the production
of TeV-mass black holes and gravitons. Within the extra dimensional scenario,
also the minimal length comes into the reach of experiment and sets a

picture for one-particle sector of the theory. The second possibility is based
on the following observation. Besides the nonlinear MS transformations, the MS
energy-momentum relation is invariant also under some inhomogeneous linear
transformations. The latter are induced starting from linearly realized Lorentz
group in five-dimensional position space. Particle dynamics and kinematics are
formulated starting from the corresponding five-dimensional interval. There is

systematic framework to find canonical metrics on Riemannian manifolds and make
advances towards their classification by proving the geometrization conjecture.

is shown to be integrable using an infinite dimensional algebra with
antisymmetric Cartan kernel that incorporates the deformation variable into its
root system. The deformations of two dimensional surfaces also control the
Ricci flow on 3-manifolds and their decomposition into prime factors by
applying surgery prior to the formation of singularities along shrinking

A motivating factor is the existence of many different methods of estimation,
leading to possibly competing estimators.
  We consider here three different types of aggregation: model selection (MS)
aggregation, convex (C) aggregation and linear (L) aggregation. The objective
of (MS) is to select the optimal single estimator from the list; that of (C) is
to select the optimal convex combination of the given estimators; and that of
(L) is to select the optimal linear combination of the given estimators. We are
interested in evaluating the rates of convergence of the excess risks of the
estimators obtained by these procedures. Our approach is motivated by recent
minimax results in Nemirovski (2000) and Tsybakov (2003).
  There exist competing aggregation procedures achieving optimal convergence
separately for each one of (MS), (C) and (L) cases. Since the bounds in these
results are not directly comparable with each other, we suggest an alternative
solution. We prove that all the three optimal bounds can be nearly achieved via
a single ""universal"" aggregation procedure. We propose such a procedure which
consists in mixing of the initial estimators with the weights obtained by
penalized least squares. Two different penalities are considered: one of them
is related to hard thresholding techniques, the second one is a data dependent
$L_1$-type penalty. Consequently, our method can be endorsed by both the
proponents of model selection and the advocates of model averaging.

Euler-Boussinesq-alpha, or \laeba, model of turbulence. We find that the \laeba
model alters the instability in a variety of ways for fixed Rossby number and
Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency. First, it alters the location of the instability
domains in the $(\gamma,\cos\theta)-$parameter plane, where $\theta$ is the
angle of incidence the Kelvin wave makes with the axis of rotation and $\gamma$
is the eccentricity of the elliptic flow, as well as the size of the associated
Lyapunov exponent. Second, the model shrinks the width of one instability band
while simultaneously increasing another. Third, the model introduces bands of
unstable eccentric flows when the Kelvin wave is two-dimensional. We introduce
two similarity variables--one is a ratio of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency
to the model parameter $\Upsilon_0 = 1+\alpha^2\beta^2$, and the other is the
ratio of the adjusted inverse Rossby number to the same model parameter. Here,
$\alpha$ is the turbulence correlation length, and $\beta$ is the Kelvin wave
number. We show that by adjusting the Rossby number and Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a
frequency so that the similarity variables remain constant for a given value of
$\Upsilon_0$, turbulence has little effect on elliptic instability for small
eccentricities $(\gamma \ll 1)$. For moderate and large eccentricities,
however, we see drastic changes of the unstable Arnold tongues due to the
\laeba model.

spectrum at small scales. Shear effects appear at large scales, where a
different, anisotropic behavior is observed. The scalar spectrum is shown to
behave as $k^{-4/3}$ for a shear fixed in intensity and direction. For other
types of shear characteristics, the slope is generally intermediate between the
-5/3 Obukhov-Corrsin's and the -1 Batchelor's values. The physical mechanisms
at the origin of this behaviour are illustrated in terms of the motion of
Lagrangian particles. They provide an explanation to the scalar spectra shallow

resonances, swept by plasma density variation or scanned with generator
frequencies, in combination with detection of the density fluctuations in the
LAW resonances by reflectometry can serve as diagnostic tool for identification
of the effective ion mass number Aef and q-profile in tokamaks. The idea is
based on the simultaneous detection of the position of m=+/-1 local AW
resonances, which are excited by M/N=+/-1/+/-2 antenna modes, and m=0 generated
by poloidal mode coupling effect in tokamaks. According to LAW dispersion, the
m=0 resonance depends only on the effective ion mass number and does not depend
on the q-profile. Then, using these data we can define q-value at the position
of m=+/-1 L AW resonances. Using TAE coils with even toroidal modes (N=2, 4,..)
and AW generator in the frequency band 0.6-1 MHz, an application of this method

  Forum-STAIF 2005. Albuquerque, N.M. 13-17 February 2005 . No funding",,"10.1063/1.1867271",,"physics.gen-ph",,"  We live in a 3+1 space-time that is intended as a description of the universe
with three space dimensions and one time dimension. Space-time dimensionality
seems so natural that it is rarely criticized. Experiments and the highly
successful relativistic theories teach us that there are four fundamental
dimensions, among them is time that is treated as a special dimension. The
specialty of time can be removed, leading to the concept that time is simply a
function of four new fundamental dimensions, which have now identical
properties, in combination with Lorentz invariance. A model is deduced in which
a 4-space, characterized by four space-like coordinates, may host four
""equivalent but orthogonal"" space-times, each with three spatial coordinates
and one temporal coordinate. Coordinates are shared; therefore the 4-space and
the four space-times are all in one. Electromagnetic interaction is confined in
each space-time and the role of the speed of light appears to be that of a
barrier for the electromagnetic interaction. The motion of objects can be
described by four-dimensional optics in the 4-space. Each of the four
space-times may host a universe and, in agreement with recent observations, the
proposed model can be directly applied to problems like the cosmological
matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark-matter issues. Space travel may also
benefit from the concepts presented.

from laser dyes and quantum dots in opal and inverse opal photonic crystals.
Pronounced directional dependencies of the emission spectra are observed:
angular ranges of strongly reduced emission adjoin with angular ranges of
enhanced emission. It appears that emission from embedded light sources is
affected both by the periodicity and by the structural imperfections of the
crystals: the photons are Bragg diffracted by lattice planes and scattered by
unavoidable structural disorder. Using a model comprising diffuse light
transport and photonic band structure, we quantitatively explain the
directional emission spectra. This provides detailed understanding of the
transport of spontaneously emitted light in real photonic crystals, which is
essential in the interpretation of quantum-optics in photonic band-gap crystals
and for applications wherein directional emission and total emission power are
controlled.

correction to the two-photon decay width in hydrogenlike atoms. It is shown
that an effective treatment of the correction using a Lamb-shift ""potential""
leads to equivalent results in both the length as well as the velocity gauges
provided all relevant correction terms are taken into account. Specifically,
the relevant radiative corrections are related to the energies that enter into
the propagator denominators, to the Hamiltonian, to the wave functions, and to
the energy conservation condition that holds between the two photons; the form
of all of these effects is different in the two gauges, but the final result is
shown to be gauge invariant, as it should be. Although the actual calculation
only involves integrations over nonrelativistic hydrogenic Green functions, the
derivation of the leading logarithmic correction can be regarded as slightly
more complex than that of other typical logarithmic terms. The dominant
radiative correction to the 2S two-photon decay width is found to be -2.020536
(alpha/pi) (Zalpha)^2 ln[(Zalpha)^-2] in units of the leading nonrelativistic
expression. This result is in agreement with a length-gauge calculation [S. G.
Karshenboim and V. G. Ivanov, e-print physics/9702027], where the coefficient
was given as -2.025(1).

formulated based on the notion of time and space, both of which are thought a
priori given quantities or notions. However, when we try to define the notion
of velocity or momentum, we encounter a difficulty as we will see in chapter 1.
The problem is that if the notion of time is given a priori, the velocity is
definitely determined when given a position, which contradicts the uncertainty
principle of Heisenberg. We then set the basis of QM on the notion of position
and momentum operators as in chapter 2. Time of a local system then is defined
approximately as a ratio $|x|/|v|$ between the space coordinate $x$ and the
velocity $v$. In this formulation of QM, we can keep the uncertainty principle,
and time is a quantity that does not have precise values unlike the usually
supposed notion of time has. The feature of local time is that it is a time
proper to each local system, which is defined as a finite set of quantum
mechanical particles. We now have an infinite number of local times that are
unique and proper to each local system. Based on the notion of local time, the
motion inside a local system is described by the usual Schr\""odinger equation.
We investigate such motion in a given local system in part II. This is a usual
quantum mechanics. After some excursion of the investigation of local motion,
we consider in part III the relative relation or motion between plural local
systems. In the final part IV, we will prove that there is at least one
Universe wave function $\phi$ in which all local systems have local motions and
thus local times. This concludes our formulation of Quantum Mechanics.
