dipping low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1323-62 during a 2003 January XMM-Newton
observation. These features are superposed on a broad emission feature centered
on 6.6 {+0.1}{-0.2} keV. During dipping intervals the equivalent width of the
Fe XXV feature increases while that of the Fe XXVI feature decreases,
consistent with the presence of less strongly ionized material in the
line-of-sight. As observed previously, the changes in the 1.0-10 keV spectrum
during dips are inconsistent with a simple increase in absorption by cool
material. However, the changes in both the absorption features and the
continuum can be modeled by variations in the properties of an ionized
absorber. No partial covering of any component of the spectrum, and hence no
extended corona, are required. From persistent to deep dipping the
photo-ionization parameter, Xi, expressed in erg cm s^{-1}, decreases from
log(Xi) of 3.9 +/- 0.1 to log(Xi) of 3.13 +/- 0.07, while the equivalent
hydrogen column density of the ionized absorber increases from (3.8 +/- 0.4)
10^{22} atoms cm^{-2} to (37 +/- 2) 10^{22} atoms cm^{-2}. Since highly-ionized
absorption features are seen from many other dip sources, this mechanism may
also explain the overall changes in X-ray spectrum observed during dipping
intervals from these systems.

fluxes from galaxies in order to convert them to star formation rates, namely
for NII contamination and for extinction internal to the galaxy. From an
imaging study using narrow-band filters, we find the NII and H-alpha emission
to be differently distributed. In most disk star formation regions the NII
fraction is small, whereas some galaxies display a diffuse central component
which can be dominated by NII emission. We consider explanations for variations
in the NII/H-alpha ratio, including metallicity variations and different
excitation mechanisms. We then estimate the extinction towards star formation
regions in spiral galaxies, firstly using Br-gamma/H-alpha line ratios. We find
that extinction values are larger in galaxy nuclei than in disks, and that
there is no evidence for heavily dust-embedded regions emerging in the near-IR.
We use optical emission line data from the literature to show only a moderate
dependence of extinction on inclination, consistent with broad-band photometric
studies; typical extinctions are smaller for late-type dwarfs than for spiral
types. Finally, we show that the application of type-dependent extinction
corrections significantly improves the agreement between star formation rates
from H-alpha and IRAS fluxes. This agreement argues against star formation in
normal galaxies being dominated by heavily dust-embedded components.

superimpose a reference spectrum onto a stellar spectrum is currently the most
widely adopted approach to obtain precision radial velocities of solar-type

in its original version, it only allows us to measure precise radial velocities

discuss applications of the technique to stellar astronomy and searches for
extrasolar planets in binary systems. In particular, we combine the
interferometric data collected with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer with our
preliminary precision velocities of the spectroscopic double-lined binary HD
4676 to demonstrate that with such a combination one can routinely obtain

complex pattern of velocities in the ejecta. We show that the large, dusty NW
arc, expanding at 50 km/sec with respect to the embedded star, is kinematically
distinct from the surrounding nebulosity and was ejected about 400 years ago.
Other large, more filamentary loops were probably expelled as much as 800 to
1000 years ago while knots and small arcs close to the star resulted from more
recent events 100 to 200 years ago. The more diffuse, uniformly distributed gas
and dust is surprisingly stationary with little or no velocity relative to the
star. This is not what we would expect for the circumstellar material from an
evolved red supergiant with a long history of mass loss. We therefore suggest
that the high mass loss rate for VY CMa is a measure of the mass carried out by
these specific ejections accompanied by streams or flows of gas through low
density regions in the dust envelope. VY CMa may thus be our most extreme
example of stellar activity, but our results also bring into question the

diblock copolymer poly(butadiene-b-N-methyl 4-vinyl pyridinium) [PBd-b-P4VPQ]
has been studied with phase contrast, polarized light, and fluorescence
microscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Encapsulation was achieved
with a single emulsion technique. For this purpose, an aqueous DNA solution is
emulsified in an organic solvent (toluene) and stabilized by the amphiphilic
diblock copolymer. The PBd block forms an interfacial brush, whereas the
cationic P4VPQ block complexes with DNA. A subsequent change of the quality of
the organic solvent results in a collapse of the PBd brush and the formation of
a capsule. Inside the capsules, the DNA is compacted as shown by the appearance
of birefringent textures under crossed polarizers and the increase in
fluorescence intensity of labeled DNA. The capsules can also be dispersed in
aqueous medium to form vesicles, provided they are stabilized with an osmotic
agent (polyethylene glycol) in the external phase. It is shown that the DNA is
released from the vesicles once the osmotic pressure drops below 105 N/m2 or if
the ionic strength of the supporting medium exceeds 0.1 M. The method has also
proven to be efficient to encapsulate pUC18 plasmid in sub-micron sized

the preparation of the charge inverse system: cationic poly(ethylene imine)

have been suggested: the parametric instability mechanism involving a small
number of modes and the formation of a nearly continuous Kolmogorov-type
cascade. Using a network of oscillators constructed from the eigenmodes of a
perfect fluid incompressible star, we investigate the transition between the
two regimes numerically. Our network includes the 4995 inertial modes up to n<=
30 with 146,998 direct couplings to the r-mode and 1,306,999 couplings with
detuning< 0.002 (out of a total of approximately 10^9 possible couplings).
  The lowest parametric instability thresholds for a range of temperatures are
calculated and it is found that the r-mode becomes unstable to modes with
13<n<15. In the undriven, undamped, Hamiltonian version of the network the rate
to achieve equipartition is found to be amplitude dependent, reminiscent of the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem. More realistic models driven unstable by
gravitational radiation and damped by shear viscosity are explored next. A
range of damping rates, corresponding to temperatures 10^6K to 10^9K, is
considered. Exponential growth of the r-mode is found to cease at small
amplitudes, approximately 10^-4. For strongly damped, low temperature models, a
few modes dominate the dynamics. The behavior of the r-mode is complicated, but
its amplitude is still no larger than about 10^-4 on average. For high
temperature, weakly damped models the r-mode feeds energy into a sea of
oscillators that achieve approximate equipartition. In this case the r-mode
amplitude settles to a value for which the rate to achieve equipartition is
approximately the linear instability growth rate.

possibility to address some of the fundamental and non-perturbative QCD
problems in particle physics, such as hadron spectrum and Regge behavior of the
scattering amplitude at high energies. One of the most fundamental and
long-standing problem is the high energy behavior of total cross-sections.
According to a series of exhaustive tests by the COMPETE group, (1). total
cross-sections have a universal Heisenberg behavior in energy corresponding to
the maximal energy behavior allowed by the Froissart bound, i.e., $A + B ln^2
(s/s_0)$ with $B \sim 0.32 mb$ and $s_0 \sim 34.41 GeV^2$ for all reactions,
and (2). the factorization relation among $\sigma_{pp, even}, \sigma_{\gamma
p}, and \sigma_{\gamma \gamma}$ is well satisfied by experiments. I discuss the
recent interesting application of the gauge/string-gravity duality of $AdS/CFT$
correspondence with a deformed background metric so as to break the conformal
symmetry that can lead to the Heisenberg behavior of rising total
cross-sections, and present some preliminary results on the high energy QCD
from Planckian scattering in $AdS$ and black-hole production.

the noncommutative versions of such important structures as Symm the Hopf
algebra of symmetric functions. Not least because the right noncommmutative
versions are often more beautiful than the commutaive ones (not all cluttered
up with counting coefficients). NSymm and QSymm are not truly the full

cocommutative, the other is maximally non cocommutative but commutative. There
is a common, selfdual generalization, the Hopf algebra of permutations of

vast generalizations leading to the Hopf algebras of endomorphisms and word
Hopf algebras with which this paper is concerned. This point of view also sheds
light on the somewhat mysterious formulas of MPR and on the question where all
the extra structure (such as autoduality) comes from. The paper concludes with
a few sections on the structure of MPR and the question of algebra retractions

thus far with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. In the most central Au+Au collisions
at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high
energy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of
freedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system
are found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of
particle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple
scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in
simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged
particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing
Au+Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of
participants at higher pT (~4 GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse
momentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and
elliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of
pseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the
colliding nuclei, a property we describe as ""extended longitudinal scaling''.
Finally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were
found to factorize to a surprising degree.

  Nice (France)",,"10.1541/ieejfms.125.962",,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  Two-fluid flowing equilibrium configurations of a helicity-driven spherical
torus (HD-ST) are numerically determined by using the combination of the finite
difference and the boundary element methods. It is found from the numerical
results that electron fluids near the central conductor are tied to an external
toroidal field and ion fluids are not. The magnetic configurations change from
the high-$q$ HD-ST ($q$>1) with paramagnetic toroidal field and low-$\beta$
(volume average $\beta$ value, ($<\beta>\approx$ 2 %) through the
helicity-driven spheromak and RFP to the ultra low-$q$ HD-ST (0<q<1) with
diagmagnetic toroidal field and high-$\beta$ ($\beta\approx 18\%) as the
external toroidal field at the inner edge region decreases and reverses the
sign. The two-fluid effecs are more significant in this equilibrium transition
when the ion diagmagnetic drift is dominant in the flowing two-fluid.

Resonance (UHR) layer plays an important role in plasma heating through
cyclotron resonance. Wave generation at UHR and parametric decay at high power
has been observed during Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) heating experiments
in toroidal magnetic fusion devices. A small linear system with ECR and UHR
layer within the system has been used to conduct experiments on X-B conversion
and parametric decay process as a function of system parameters. Direct probing
{\em in situ} is conducted and plasma heating is evidenced by soft x-ray
emission measurement. Experiments are performed with hydrogen plasma produced
with 160-800 W microwave power at 2.45 GHz of operating frequency at $10^{-3}$
mbar pressure. The axial magnetic field required for ECR is such that the
resonant surface (B = 875 G) is situated at the geometrical axis of the plasma
system. Experimental results will be presented in the paper.

In such systems it is possible to control the `super arrival' time in one of

is yet another quantum nonlocal effect. Negative time delays (time advancement)
and `ultra Hartman effect' with negative saturation times have been observed in
