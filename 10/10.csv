  II ESI Spectra: Variations in Outflow Velocity with Galactic Mass","12 pages+figures and tables; submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.621:227-245,2005","10.1086/427277",,"astro-ph",,"  Measurements of interstellar absorption lines in 18 ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIGs) have been combined with published data, in order to reassess
the dependence of galactic outflow speeds on starburst luminosity and galactic
mass. The Doppler shifts reveal outflows of relatively cool gas at $330 \pm
100$km/s. The outflow speeds increase with the star formation rate (SFR) as
roughly $v \propto SFR^{0.35}$. This result is surprising since, in the
traditional model for starburst-driven winds, these relatively cool gas clouds
are accelerated by the ram pressure of a hot, supernova-heated wind that
exhibits weak (if any) \x temperature variation with increasing galactic mass.
The lack of evidence for much hotter winds is partly a sensitivity issue; but
the outflow velocities in ultraluminous starbursts actually are consistent with
acceleration by the tepid wind, indicating a hotter component is unlikely to
dominate the momentum flux. The \nad velocities in the dwarf starburst winds do
not reach the terminal velocity of a hot wind at the measured temperature of kT
~0.73 keV. A dynamically-motivated explanation is that the dwarf starburst
winds simply lack enough momentum to accelerate the clouds to the velocity of
the hot wind. Among the subsample of starbursts with well- constrained
dynamical masses, the terminal outflow velocities approach the galactic escape
velocity. If this relation, which is similar to that observed for stellar
winds, arises from radiation pressure on dust and gas limiting the maximum
luminosity of a starburst, then feedback will be stronger in massive galaxies
than previously thought helping shape the high-mass end of the galaxy
luminosity function.

through considering the accretion flow to drag the field lines aside and dilute
the polar field strength, and as a result the equatorial field strength
increases and is buried inside the crust. The main conclusions of model are as
follows: (i) the polar field decays with increasing the accreted mass; (ii) The
bottom magnetic field strength of about $10^8$ G can occur when neutron star
magnetosphere radius approaches the star radius, which depends on the accretion
rate as $\mdot^{1/2}$; (iii) The neutron star magnetosphere radius decreases
with accretion until it reaches the star radius, and its evolution is little
influenced by the initial field and the accretion rate after accreting $\sim
0.01 \ms$, which implies that the magnetosphere radii of neutron stars in LMXBs
would be homogeneous for Z sources and Atoll sources if they accreted the
comparable masses. As an extension, the physics effects of the possible strong
magnetic zone in the X-ray neutron stars and recycled pulsars are discussed.
Moreover, The strong magnetic fields in the binary pulsars PSR 1831-00 and PSR
1718-19 after accreting about half solar mass in the binary accretion phase,
$8.7\times10^{10}$ G and $1.28\times10^{12}$ G, respectively, can be explained
through considering the incomplete frozen flow in the polar zone. As a model's
expectation, the existence of the low magnetic field ($\sim 3\times 10^{7}$ G)
neutron stars or millisecond pulsars is suggested.

heating process that may even dominate over dissipative heating. Despite the
importance of advection on it's structure, the disk remains geometrically thin.
Global solutions of advective accretion disks, which describe continuously the
transition between optically thick outer region and optically thin inner region

demonstrated that there exists the boomerang behavior, that is, both Tc and the

decreases beyond the saturation point in the overdoped region in agreement with

is demonstrated that the sharpening of the observed quasi-particle peak below

excitations are fractionalized into relativistic bosons (spinons). These holons
and spinons interact via U(1) gauge fluctuations. Effects of Berry phase to the
localized spins disappear due to the presence of Kondo couplings, causing the
spinon excitations gapped. Furthermore, the gauge fluctuations are suppressed
by hole doping. As a result, massive spinons are deconfined to arise in the
localized spins unless the Kondo hybridization is strong enough. When the Kondo
hybridization strength exceeds a certain value, we find that the localized spin
chain becomes critical. This indicates that the present one dimensional Kondo
lattice model exhibits a phase transition from a spin-gapped phase to a

not be neglected. The stability of the solitons predicted for repulsive

supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, making the present constructions at
best incomplete. Whereas these tadpoles are typically large, a closer look at
the problem from a perturbative viewpoint has the potential of illuminating at
least some of its qualitative features in String Theory. A possible scheme to
this effect was proposed long ago by Fischler and Susskind, but incorporating
background redefinitions in string amplitudes in a systematic fashion has long
proved very difficult. In the first part of this paper, drawing from field
theory examples, we thus begin to explore what one can learn by working
perturbatively in a ``wrong'' vacuum. While unnatural in Field Theory, this
procedure presents evident advantages in String Theory, whose definition in
curved backgrounds is mostly beyond reach at the present time. At the field
theory level, we also identify and characterize some special choices of vacua
where tadpole resummations terminate after a few contributions. In the second

to some extent at the full string level, providing some evidence for a new link

the mechanism of the avoidance of crossing between dispersion curves. The
third-order dispersion of the quasi-surface mode is necessary for the existence
of the gap. Numerical investigation reveals that the entire bandgap is filled
with solitons, and they all are stable in direct simulations. The gap-soliton
(GS) family is extended to include pulses moving relative to the given
reference frame, up to limit values of the corresponding boost $\delta $,
beyond which the solitons do not exists. The limit values are nonsymmetric for
$\delta >0$ and $\delta <0$. The extended gap is also entirely filled with the

problem we consider can be reduced to a problem in which the strategy of set
discrimination can be used in designing measurements to discriminate mixed
states unambiguously. We find a necessary and sufficient condition of
unambiguous mixed state discrimination, and also point out that searching the
optimal success probability of unambiguous discrimination is mathematically the
well-known semi-definite programming problem. A upper bound of the optimal
success probability is also presented. Finally, We generalize the concept of
set discrimination to mixed state and point out that the problem of
discriminating it unambiguously is equivalent to that of unambiguously
