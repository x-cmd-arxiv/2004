the metal-deficient open cluster, NGC 2243. Restricting the data to probable
single members of the cluster using the CMD and the photometric indices alone
generates a sample of 100 stars at the cluster turnoff. The average E(b-y) =
0.039 (0.003 s.e.m.) or E(B-V) = 0.055 (0.004 s.e.m.), where the errors refer
to internal errors alone. With this reddening, [Fe/H] is derived from both m_1
and hk, using b-y and Hbeta as the temperature index. The agreement among the
four approaches is excellent, leading to a final weighted average of [Fe/H] =
-0.57 (0.03 s.e.m.) for the cluster, on a scale where the Hyades has [Fe/H] =
+0.12. Using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data, 27 probable
cluster members are identified and used to delineate the red giant branch and a
well-defined clump at V = 13.70, while eliminating the so-called second clump
at V = 14.1. Interpolation between isochrones of appropriate [Fe/H] leads to an
apparent modulus of (m-M) = 13.15 +/- 0.1 and an age of 3.8 +/- 0.2 Gyr. A
differential CMD comparison with Berkeley 29, a cluster with a galactocentric
distance almost twice that of NGC 2243, constrains Berkeley 29 to be at least
as young and as metal-rich as NGC 2243.

spirals were already in place 8 Gyr ago, leading to a very modest recent star
formation in intermediate mass galaxies. This is challenged by a recent
analysis (Heavens et al. 2004) of the fossil record of the stellar populations
of ~10^5 nearby galaxies, which show that intermediate mass galaxies have
formed or assembled the bulk of their stars 4 to 8 Gyr ago. Here we present
direct observational evidence supporting the Heavens et al's findings from a
long term, multi-wavelength study of 195 z>0.4 intermediate mass galaxies,
mostly selected from the CFRS survey. We show that a recent and efficient star
formation is revealed at IR wavelengths since ~15% of intermediate mass
galaxies at z>0.4 are indeed luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs), a phenomenon far
more common than in the local Universe. The star formation in LIRGs is
sufficient in itself to produce 38% of the total stellar mass of intermediate
mass galaxies and then to account for most of the reported stellar mass
formation since z=1. The high occurrence of LIRGs is easily understood only if
they correspond to episodic peaks of star formation, during which galaxies are
reddened through short IREs (infrared episodes). We examine how galaxy IREs can
be related to the emergence at high redshift, of the abundant population of
galaxies with small size, blue core and many irregularities. We show that
recent merging and gas infall naturally explain both morphological changes and
episodic star formation history in a hierarchical galaxy formation frame. We
propose a simple scenario in which 75+-25% of intermediate mass spirals have
experienced recently their last major merger event, leading to a drastic
reshaping of their bulges and disks during the last 8 Gyrs.

the maximum energy along the jet implies particle reacceleration acting along
the entire jet. In addition to the already established global anti-correlation

OB1 association, carried out with the QuEST camera at the Venezuela National
Astronomical Observatory. We identify for the first time the widely spread
low-mass, young population in the Orion OB1a and OB1b sub-associations.
Candidate members were picked up by their variability in the V-band and
position in color-magnitude diagrams. We obtained spectra to confirm
membership. In a region spanning ~ 68 deg^2 we found 197 new young stars; of
these, 56 are located in the Ori OB1a subassociation and 142 in Ori OB1b.
Comparison with the spatial extent of molecular gas and extinction maps
indicates that the subassociation Ori 1b is concentrated within a ring-like
structure of radius ~2 deg (~15 pc at 440 pc), centered roughly on the star
epsilon Ori in the Orion belt. The ring is apparent in 13CO and corresponds to
a region with an extinction Av>=1. The stars exhibiting strong Ha emission, an
indicator of active accretion, are found along this ring, while the center is
populated with weak Ha emitting stars. In contrast, Ori OB1a is located in a
region devoid of gas and dust. We identify a grouping of stars within a ~3
deg^2 area located in 1a, roughly clustered around the B2 star 25 Ori. The
Herbig Ae/Be star V346 Ori is also associated with this grouping, which could
be an older analog of sigma Ori. Using using several sets of evolutionary
tracks we find an age of 7 - 10 Myr for Ori 1a and of ~4 - 6 Myr for Ori OB1b,
consistent with previous estimates from OB stars. Indicators such as the
equivalent width of Ha and near-IR excesses show that while a substantial
fraction of accreting disks remain at ages ~5 Myr, inner disks are essentially
dissipated by 10 Myr.

18um photometry with OSCIR at Gemini for 6 CTTS; of these, all 6 were detected
at 10um while only one was detected at 18um. We estimate mass accretion rates
from the excess luminosity at U, and find that they are consistent with
determinations for a number of other associations, with or without high mass
star formation. The observed decrease of mass accretion rate with age is
qualitatively consistent with predictions of viscous evolution of accretion
disks. We find an overall decrease of disk emission from Taurus to Ori OB1b to
Ori OB1a. This decrease implies that significant grain growth and settling
towards the midplane has taken place in the inner disks of Ori OB1. We compare
the SED of the star detected at both 10um and 18um with disk models for similar
stellar and accretion parameters. We find that the low <= 18 um fluxes of this
Ori OB1b star cannot be due to the smaller disk radius expected from viscous
evolution in the presence of the FUV radiation fields from the OB stars in the
association. Instead, we find that the disk of this star is essentially a flat
disk, with little if any flaring, indicating a a significant degree of dust
settling towards the midplane, as expected from dust evolution in
protoplanetary disks.

dominated by the composite stellar black body curve and peaks at approximately
1.6 microns, the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of active galaxies is
dominated by a power law. Consequently, with sufficient wavelength baseline,
one can easily distinguish AGN from stellar populations. Mirroring the tendency
of AGN to be bluer than galaxies in the ultraviolet, where galaxies (and stars)
sample the blue, rising portion of stellar spectra, AGN tend to be redder than
galaxies in the mid-infrared, where galaxies sample the red, falling portion of
the stellar spectra. We report on Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared colors,
derived from the IRAC Shallow Survey, of nearly 10,000 spectroscopically
identified sources from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. Based on this
spectroscopic sample, we find that simple mid-infrared color criteria provide
remarkably robust separation of active galaxies from normal galaxies and
Galactic stars, with over 80% completeness and less than 20% contamination.
Considering only broad-lined AGN, these mid-infrared color criteria identify
over 90% of spectroscopically identified quasars and Seyfert 1s. Applying these

luminosity evolution. Thus, all AGNs drop in luminosity by almost an order of
magnitude over this redshift range. We show that this observed drop is due to
AGN downsizing. We directly compare our BLAGN HXLFs with the optical QSO LFs
and find that the optical QSO LFs do not probe faint enough to see the downturn
in the BLAGN HXLFs. We rule out galaxy dilution as a partial explanation for
the observation that BLAGNs dominate the number densities at the higher X-ray
luminosities, while optically-narrow AGNs (FWHM<2000 km/s) dominate at the
lower X-ray luminosities by measuring the nuclear UV/optical properties of the
Chandra sources using the HST ACS GOODS-North data. The UV/optical nuclei of
the optically-narrow AGNs are much weaker than expected if they were similar to
the BLAGNs. We therefore postulate the need for a luminosity dependent unified
model. Alternatively, the BLAGNs and the optically-narrow AGNs could be
intrinsically different source populations. We cover both interpretations by
constructing composite spectral energy distributions--including long-wavelength
data from the MIR to the submillimeter--by spectral type and by X-ray
luminosity. We use these to infer the bolometric corrections (from hard X-ray
luminosities to bolometric luminosities) needed to map the accretion history.

precession, internal jet rotation and motion along a global helical magnetic
field. We point out that for non-ballistic helical motion the observed period
may appear strongly shortened due to classical travel time effects. Finally,
the possible relevance of the above mentioned driving mechanisms is discussed

stellar collisions play an important role in their further evolution. In such
environments the same star may participate in several tens to hundreds of
collisions ultimately leading to the collapse of the star to a black hole of
intermediate mass. At later time the black hole may acquire a companion star by
tidal capture or by dynamical --3-body-- capture. When this companion star
evolves it will fill its Roche-lobe and transfer mass to its accompanying black
hole. This then leads to a bright phase of X-ray emission but the binary may
also be visible as a source of gravitational wave radiation in the LISA band.
If the star captured by the intermediate mass black hole is relatively low mass
($\aplt 2$ \msun) the binary will be visible as a bright source in
gravitational waves and X-rays for the entire lifetime of the binary. The
majority of compact binaries which formed from the population of primordial
binaries in young and dense star clusters do not lead to detectable

both magnetic field and column density measurements range over two orders of

self-gravitational pressure. These results together mean that the
one-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigv$ is proportional to the mean \Alf
speed of a cloud $\va$. Global models of MHD turbulence in a molecular cloud
show that this correlation is naturally satisfied for a range of different
driving strengths of the turbulence. For example, an increase of turbulent
driving causes a cloud expansion which also increases $\va$. Clouds are in a
time averaged balance but exhibit large oscillatory motions, particularly in
their outer rarefied regions. We also discuss models of gravitational
fragmentation in a sheet-like region in which turbulence has already
dissipated, including the effects of magnetic fields and ion-neutral friction.
Clouds with near-critical mass-to-flux ratios lead to subsonic infall within
cores, consistent with some recent observations of motions in starless cores.
Conversely, significantly supercritical clouds are expected to produce extended
supersonic infall.

relatively red underlying stellar populations (typically (B-R)>~1mag) show
structural properties compatible with those of dwarf elliptical galaxies (i.e.
a smooth light distribution, fainter extrapolated central surface brightness
and larger scale lengths than BCD galaxies with blue underlying stellar

that the interaction of the jets with a twisted-tilted (wrapped) accretion disk

The proposed scenario is based on two plausible assumptions. (1) There is an
inclination between the jet and the outer parts of the disk; the jet is
perpendicular to the inner part of the disk; Namely, there is a twisted-tilted
(wrapped) disk. (2) The disk-jet interaction slows down the jet as the jet
entrains mass from the disk, with larger decelaration of jet segments closer to

supernovae type Ia put on a phenomenological interaction between dark energy
and dark matter. The interaction can be interpreted as arising from the time
variation of the mass of dark matter particles. We find that the coupling
correlates with the equation of state: roughly speaking, a negative coupling
(in our sign convention) implies phantom energy ($w_{\phi}<-1$) while a
positive coupling implies ``ordinary'' dark energy. The constraints from the
current supernovae Ia Hubble diagram favour a negative coupling and an equation
of state $w_{\phi}<-1$. A zero or positive coupling is in fact unlikely at 99%
c.l. (assuming constant equation of state); at the same time non-phantom values
($w_{\phi}>-1$) are unlikely at 95%. We show also that the usual bounds on the
energy density weaken considerably when the coupling is introduced: values as
large as $\Omega_{m0}=0.7$ become acceptable for as concerns SNIa. We find that
the rate of change of the mass $\dot{m}/m$ of the dark matter particles is
constrained to be $\delta_{0}$ in a Hubble time, with $-10<\delta_{0}<-1$ to
95% c.l.. We show that a large positive coupling might in principle avoid the
future singularity known as ``big rip'' (occurring for $w_{\phi}<-1$) but the
parameter region for this to occur is almost excluded by the data. We also
forecast the constraints that can be obtained from future experiments, focusing
on supernovae and baryon oscillations in the power spectra of deep redshift
surveys. We show that the method of baryon oscillations holds the best
potential to contrain the coupling.

described well by the strongly anisotropic weakly interacting three-dimensional
Bose gas, and thus approximately linear in temperature with an almost

controls which of the two contributions dominates the subgap tails. We observe
that these contributions are related to each other by dimensional reduction. We
apply the theory to estimate the effects of a weak concentration of magnetic
impurities [$\approx 1 {\rm p.p.m}$] on the phase coherence of Josephson

relevant for the dephasing in large qubits, designed around a $10 {\rm \mu m}$

Little-Parks resistance oscillations, highly unusual double resistance
anomalies, two resistance peaks found near the onset of superconductivity, were
observed. Although resistance anomaly featuring a single resistance peak has
been seen in various mesoscopic superconducting samples, double resistance
anomalies have never been observed previously. The dynamical resistance
measurements suggest that there are two critical currents in these samples. In
addition, the two resistance peaks were found to be suppressed at different
magnetic fields. We attribute the observed double resistance anomalies to an
underlying phase separation in which In-rich grains of intermetallic compound
of AuIn precipitate in a uniform In-dilute matrix of Au$_{0.9}$In$_{0.1}$. The
intrinsic superconducting transition temperature of the In-rich grains is
substantially higher than that of the In-dilute matrix. The suppression of the

In-rich grains. We also report the observation of an unusual
magnetic-field-induced metallic state with its resistance higher than the
normal-state resistance, referred to here as excessive resistance, and an h/2e

weakly on temperature.

second magnetization peak (SMP), which is accompanied by thermomagnetic
instabilities (TMI). The characteristic field Hfj, where the first flux jump
occurs, has been studied as a function of the sweep rate of the magnetic field.
Interestingly, in the regime T < 6.4 K, the respective line Hfj(T) is constant,
Hfj(T < 6.4 K) = 40 Oe. A comparison to TMI observed in MgB2 bulk samples is
also performed. Our experimental findings cannot be described accurately by
current theories on TMI. In the second category, films of Tc = 8.3 K were
produced without annealing during deposition. In such films, we observed a peak
effect (PE). In high magnetic fields the PE is accompanied by a sharp drop and
a narrow hysteretic behaviour in the measured magnetoresistance. In contrast to
experimental works presented in the past, the comparison of our magnetic
measurements with the magnetoresistance data suggests that the appearance of
surface superconductivity rather than the melting transition of vortex matter
is the cause of the observed behaviour.

correlation time). Here, in contrast, we study the small dissipation case (we
retain the inertial term) and consider a noise with finite correlation time.
Our analysis is non perturbative and based on a recursive adiabatic elimination
scheme: a reduced effective Langevin dynamics for the slow action variable is
obtained after averaging out the fast angular variable. In the conservative
case, we show that the physical observables grow algebraically with time and
calculate the associated anomalous scaling exponents and generalized diffusion
constants. In the case of small dissipation, we derive an analytic expression
of the stationary Probability Distribution Function (P.D.F.) which differs from
the canonical Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. Our results are in excellent
agreement with numerical simulations.

estimate, Lambda_SM < 2-3 TeV, works reasonably well in most cases and should
be considered a conservative bound, as it ignores other contributions to the
Higgs mass which are potentially large. Besides, the possibility of an
accidental Veltman-like cancellation does not raise significantly Lambda_SM.
One can obtain more precise implications from fine-tuning arguments in specific
examples of NP. Here we consider SUSY and right-handed (seesaw) neutrinos. SUSY
is a typical example for which the previous general estimate is indeed
conservative: the MSSM is fine-tuned a few %, even for soft masses of a few
hundred GeV. In contrast, other SUSY scenarios, in particular those with
low-scale SUSY breaking, can easily saturate the general bound on Lambda_SM.
The seesaw mechanism requires large fine-tuning if M_R > 10^7 GeV, unless there

observing hard processes (dijets) in high-energy pp (pbar p) and pA (dA)
collisions. Such studies can complement the information gained from
measurements of hard exclusive processes in ep scattering. The transverse
spatial distribution of partons determines the distribution over pp impact
parameters of events with hard dijet production. Correlations in the transverse
positions of partons can be studied in multiple dijet production. We find that
the correlation cross section measured by the CDF Collaboration, sigma_eff =
14.5 +/- 1.7^{+ 1.7}_{-2.3} mb, can be explained by ""constituent quark"" type
quark-gluon correlations with r_q ~ r_N / 3, as suggested by the instanton
liquid model of the QCD vacuum. Longitudinal and transverse multiparton
correlations can be separated in a model-independent way by comparing multiple
dijet production in pp and pA collisions. Finally, we estimate the cross
section for exclusive diffractive Higgs production in pp collisions at LHC
(rapidity gap survival probability), by combining the impact parameter
distribution implied by the hard partonic process with information about soft
interactions gained in pp elastic scattering.

Yukawa parameter x_L<0.8, the enhancement of \Delta M_{d} amounts to at most
20%. Similar comments apply to \Delta M_s and \epsilon_{K}. The correction to
\Delta M_{K} is negligible. The dominant new contribution in this parameter
range, calculated here for the first time, comes from the box diagrams with
(W_L^\pm,W_H^\pm) exchanges and ordinary quarks that are only suppressed by the
mass of W_H^\pm but do not involve explicit O(v^2/f^2) factors. This
contribution is strictly positive. The explicit O(v^2/f^2) corrections to the
SM diagrams with ordinary quarks and two W_L^\pm exchanges have to be combined
with the box diagrams with a single heavy T quark exchange for the GIM
mechanism to work. These O(v^2/f^2) corrections are found to be of the same
order of magnitude as the (W_L^\pm,W_H^\pm) contribution but only for x_L
approaching 0.8 they can compete with it. We point out that for x_L>0.85 box
diagrams with two T exchanges have to be included. Although formally
O(v^4/f^4), this contribution is dominant for x_L \approx 1 due to
non-decoupling of T that becomes fully effective only at this order. We
emphasize, that the concept of the unitarity triangle is still useful in the LH
model, in spite of the O(v^2/f^2) corrections to the CKM unitarity involving
only ordinary quarks. We demonstrate the cancellation of the divergences in box

introduced by Givental in his paper ``Homological Geometry''. He conjectured
that the quantum D-module of a symplectic manifold is isomorphic to the
equivariant Floer cohomology for the universal cover of the free loop space.
First, motivated by the work of Guest, we formulate the notion of ``abstract
quantum D-module''which generalizes the D-module defined by the small quantum
cohomology algebra. Second, we define the equivariant Floer cohomology of toric
complete intersections rigorously as a D-module, using Givental's model. This
is shown to satisfy the axioms of abstract quantum D-module. By Givental's
mirror theorem, it follows that equivariant Floer cohomology defined here is
isomorphic to the quantum cohomology D-module.

approximation operator of the form $Q_af=\sum_{\alpha\in A} \Lambda_\alpha (f)
B_\alpha$ where the $B_\alpha$'s are B-splines and the $\Lambda_\alpha (f)$'s
are linear discrete or integral forms acting on the given function $f$. These
forms depend on a finite number of coefficients which are the components of
vectors $a_\alpha$ for $\alpha\in A$. The index $a$ refers to this sequence of
vectors. In order that $Q_a p=p$ for all polynomials $p$ belonging to some
subspace included in the space of splines generated by the $B_\alpha$'s, each
vector $a_\alpha$ must lie in an affine subspace $V_\alpha$, i.e. satisfy some
linear constraints. However there remain some degrees of freedom which are used
to minimize $\Vert a_\alpha \Vert_1$ for each $\alpha\in A$. It is easy to
prove that $\max \{\Vert a_\alpha \Vert_1 ; \alpha\in A\}$ is an upper bound of
$\Vert Q_a \Vert_{\infty}$: thus, instead of minimizing the infinite norm of
$Q_a$, which is a difficult problem, we minimize an upper bound of this norm,
which is much easier to do. Moreover, the latter problem has always at least
one solution, which is associated with a NB QI. In the first part of the paper,
we give a survey on NB univariate or bivariate spline QIs defined on uniform or
non-uniform partitions and already studied by the author and coworkers. In the
second part, we give some new results, mainly on univariate and bivariate
integral QIs on {\sl non-uniform} partitions: in that case, NB QIs are more
difficult to characterize and the optimal properties strongly depend on the
geometry of the partition. Therefore we have restricted our study to QIs having
interesting shape properties and/or infinite norms uniformly bounded
independently of the partition.

recently begun investigation of a potentially important mechanism for
electromagnetic radiation from space, Double Layer Radiation (DL-radiation).
This type of radiation is proposed to come from DL-associated, spatially
localized high frequency (hf) spikes that are driven by the electron beam on
the high-potential side of the double layer. It is known, but only
qualitatively, from laboratory experiments that double layers radiate in the
electromagnetic spectrum. In our experiment the spectrum has high amplitude
close to the plasma frequency, several hundred MHz. No clear theoretical model
exists today. The quantitative evaluation is complicated because measurements
are made in the near field of the radiating structure, and in the vicinity of
conducting laboratory hardware that distorts the field. Because the localized
electrostatic wavelengths (approximately 1 cm) can be relatively small compared
to the emitted electromagnetic wavelengths, the situation is further
complicated. We discuss the mutual influence between the ion density profile
and hf-spike formation, and propose that some kind of self-organization of the
density profile through the ponderomotive force of the hf spike might be
operating. First results regarding the electromagnetic radiation are reported:
the frequency, the time variation of the amplitude, and the spatial
distribution in the discharge vessel.

has been investigated using the fluctuation data measured in the plasma edge

potential and density fluctuations clearly exhibit some of the characteristics
associated with SOC: (1) existence of f -1 power-law dependence in the
frequency spectrum, (2) slowly decaying long tails in the autocorrelation
function, (3) values of Hurst parameters larger than 0.5 at all the detected
radial locations, (4) non-Gaussian PDF of fluctuations and (5) radial
propagation of avalanche-like events in the edge plasma area. During the
biasing phase, with the generation of an edge radial electric field Er and
hence a sheared ErxB flow, the local turbulence is found to be well
decorrelated by the ErxB velocity shear, consistent with theoretical
predictions. Nevertheless, it is concomitantly found that the Hurst parameters
are substantially enhanced in the negative flow shear region and in the
scrape-off layer as well, which is contrary to theoretical expectation.
Implication of these observations to our understanding of plasma transport
mechanisms is discussed.

attempted using the delayed continuous feedback method, i.e., the time-delay

orbit changes to periodic one, maintaining the instability. The chaotic state
is well controlled using the TDAS method. It is found that the control is
achieved when a delay time is chosen near the unstable periodic orbit
corresponding to the fundamental mode. Furthermore, when the delayed feedback
is applied to a periodic nonlinear regime and arbitrary time delay is chosen,
the periodic state is leaded to various motions including chaos. As a related

In the nonrelativistic regime, the dispersion relation has two branches, one
electromagnetic wave, with a low frequency cutoff at
$\sqrt{1+2\omega_p^2/\Omega_p^2}$ (where $\omega_p=(4\pi n e^2/m)^{1/2}$ is the
electron/positron plasma frequency), and an Alfv\'en wave, with high frequency
cutoff at the positron gyrofrequency $\Omega_p$. There is only one forward
propagating mode for a given frequency. However, due to relativistic effects,
there is no low frequency cutoff for the electromagnetic branch, and there
appears a critical wave number above which the Alfv\'en wave ceases to exist.
This critical wave number is given by $ck_c/\Omega_p=a/\eta$, where
$a=\omega_p^2/\Omega_p^2$ and $\eta$ is the ratio between the Alfv\'en wave
magnetic field amplitude and the background magnetic field. In this case, for

characterized by a long parallel connection length in the SOL, L_par ~q2piR. We
report on measurements in discharges, where the edge electric field is modified
by inserting a biased electrode into the edge plasma. In particular, a complex
picture is observed, if the biased electrode is located inside the SOL. The
poloidal distribution of the floating potential appears to be strongly
non-uniform at biasing. The peaks of potential are observed at particular
poloidal angles. This is interpreted as formation of a biased flux tube, which
emanates from the electrode along the magnetic field lines and snakes q times
around the torus. The resulting electric field in the SOL is 2-dimensional,
having the radial as well as the poloidal component. It is demonstrated that
the poloidal electric field E_pol convects the edge plasma radially due to the
E_pol x B_T drift either inward or outward depending on its sign. The
convective particle flux is by two orders of magnitude larger than the
fluctuation-induced one and consequently dominates.

obtained in terms of (a D-dimensional generalization of) the Johnson-Lippmann
operator, an extension of the Runge-Lenz-Pauli vector that relativistically
incorporates spin degrees of freedom. So the extra symmetry (S(2))in the
quantum Kepler problem, which determines the degeneracy of the levels, is so
robust as to accommodate the relativistic case in arbitrary dimensions.

which achieves perfect quantum state transfer and which is efficient with
respect to the number chains employed in the scheme. The system consists of $M$
uncoupled identical quantum chains. Local control (gates, measurements) is only
allowed at the sending/receiving end of the chains. Under a quite general
hypothesis on the interaction Hamiltonian of the qubits a theorem is proved
which shows that the receiver is able to asymptotically recover the messages by
repetitive monitoring of his qubits.

atoms are confined by optical dipole forces at the antinodes of a standing wave
generated by the two counter-propagating modes of a laser-driven high-finesse
ring cavity. By heterodyning the Bragg-scattered light with a reference beam,
we obtain detailed information on phase shifts imparted by the Bragg scattering
process. Being deep in the Lamb-Dicke regime, the scattered light is not
broadened by the motion of individual atoms. In contrast, we have detected
signatures of global translatory motion of the atomic grating.
