absorption in the disk of the Milky Way. We find that OVI absorption occurs
throughout most of the Galactic plane, at least out to several kpc from the
Sun, and that it is distributed smoothly enough for the column density to
decline with height above the disk and with distance in the plane. However, the
OVI absorbing gas is clumpy, and moves at peculiar velocities relative to that
expected from Galactic rotation. We conclude that the observed absorption is
likely to be a direct indicator of the structures formed when violent,
dynamical processes heat the ISM, such as blowout from multiple supernovae
events.

local and a global background correction to take in account the presence of
large scale structures and variations from field to field, respectively. The
composite LF clearly shows two components: a bright-end LF with a classical
slope of -1.25 in each photometric band, and a faint-end LF much steeper (-2.1
<= \alpha <= -1.6) in the dwarf galaxy region. The observed upturn of the faint
galaxies has a location ranging from -16 +5log(h) in the g band to -18.5
+5log(h) in the z band. To study the universality of the cluster LF we compare
the individual cluster LFs with the composite luminosity function. We notice
that, in agreement with the composite LF, a single Schechter component is not a
good fit for the majority of the clusters. We fit a Schechter function to the
bright-end of the individual clusters LFs in the magnitude region brighter than
the observed upturn of the dwarf galaxies. We observe that the distributions of
the derived parameters is close to a Gaussian around the value of the composite
bright-end LF parameters with a dispersion compatible with the statistical
errors. We conclude that the bright-end of the galaxy clusters is universal. To
study the behavior of the individual faint-end LF we define the Dwarf to Giant
galaxy Ratio (DGR) of the single clusters. We notice that the distribution of
DGR has a spread much larger than the statistical errors. Our conclusion is
that the cluster luminosity function is not universal since the cluster
faint-end, differently from the bright-end, varies from cluster to cluster.

  Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 2004",,,,"astro-ph",,"  During the low optical brightness states of AM Herculis systems (polars) when
accretion has declined to a very low value, the underlying magnetic white dwarf
photosphere can be modelled without the complication of thermal bremstrahlung
and cyclotron emission from the luminous accretion column. The far ultraviolet
spectra can be modelled with high gravity solar composition photospheres. In
this way, I present new temperatures and the first chemical abundance estimates
for the white dwarfs in three selected polars from the IUE NEWSIPS archive. For
the white dwarf in V834 Cen with Teff = 16,000$K, Si/H = 0.1 solar, C/H = 0.5
solar, for BY Cam, Teff = 17,000 K, Si/H = 0.1, C/H = 5 solar and for RX
J1313-32, Teff = 22,000 K, Si/H = 0.1 solar, C/H = 0.1 solar. The temperature
distribution of 24 white dwarfs in polars with known temperatures above and
below the period gap is compared with the distribution of the white dwarf
temperatures in dwarf novae during quiescence. In both cases, the magnetic
white dwarfs in polars are significantly cooler than the non-magnetics. For all
CV white dwarfs, magnetic and non-magnetic with Teff < 12,500 K, 91% of the
objects (10 out of 11) are magnetics in polars. This suggests that long term
accretion heating and cooling of white dwarfs in polars differs from the
effects of long term accretion in non-magnetic disk accretors.

radiative cooling of baryons, and the energy feedback from supernovae and
active galactic nuclei or quasars combine to govern the amount and the thermal
state of the hot plasma pervading groups and clusters of galaxies. We show
that, by itself, supernova preheating of the external gas flowing into clusters
falls short of explaining the observed X-ray scaling relations of the plasma
luminosity L_X or the plasma entropy K versus the X-ray temperature T. To
account for the scaling laws from rich to poor clusters takes preheating
enhanced by the energy input from active galactic nuclei. In groups, on the
other hand, the internal impacts of powerful quasars going off in member
galaxies can blow some plasma out of the structure. So they depress L_X and
raise K to the observed average levels; meanwhile, the sporadic nature of such
impulsive events generates the intrinsic component of the wide scatter apparent
in the data. The same quasar feedback gives rise in groups to entropy profiles
as steep as observed, a feature hard to explain with simple preheating schemes.
Finally, we argue a close connection of the L_X-T or the K-T relation with the
M_{\bullet}-\sigma correlation between the host velocity dispersion and the
masses of the black holes, relics of the quasar activity.

There exists a correlation between the strength of the magnetic field, B, at
the peak of it's spectrum and the location of the peak, given at the present
epoch by: B ~ 5x10^{-12} (L/kpc) Gauss, where L is the correlation length
determined by the initial magnetic field. (c) Concerning studies of generation
of cosmic microwave background (CMBR) anisotropies due to primordial magnetic
fields of B~10^{-9} Gauss on ~ 10 Mpc scales, such fields are not only
impossible to generate in early causal magnetogenesis scenarios but also
seemingly ruled out by distortions of the CMBR spectrum due to magnetic field
dissipation on smaller scales and the overproduction of cluster magnetic
fields. (d) The most promising detection possibility of CMBR distortions due to
primordial magnetic fields may be on much smaller scales at higher multipoles
l~10^6 where the signal is predicted to be the strongest. (e) It seems possible
that magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies are entirely of primordial origin,
without invoking dynamo amplification. Such fields would be of (pre-collapse)
strength 10^{-12} - 10^{-11} Gauss with correlation lengths in the kpc range,

The thermal nature of the X-ray-emitting gas is well established, although its
chemical and ionization states remain largely uncertain. The X-ray luminosity
of the gas is proportional to the star formation rate and to the stellar mass
of the galaxies. But the luminosity accounts for at most a few percent of the
expected supernova mechanical energy input. Therefore, there is a ``missing''
energy problem for spiral galaxies. Much of the energy in late-type spirals may
be converted and radiated in lower energy bands. But early-type ones most

molecular clouds, there are three distinct groups of molecules distinguished by
the location of their emission within the nuclear region. N2H+, C18O, HNC and
HCN are widespread and bright, good overall tracers of dense molecular gas. C2H

50-100 pc region, where radiation fields are high. The third group of
molecules, CH3OH and HNCO, correlates well with the expected locations of
bar-induced orbital shocks. The good correlation of HNCO with the established
shock tracer molecule CH3OH is evidence that this molecule, whose chemistry has
been uncertain, is indeed produced by processing of grains. HC3N is observed to
correlate tightly with 3mm continuum emission, demonstrating that the young
starbursts are the sites of the warmest and densest molecular gas. We compare

fields in a group of sdB/OB/O stars. The project was inspired by the discovery
of three super-metal-rich sdOB stars, each having metals (e.g. Ti, V) enhanced
by factors of 10^3 to 10^5. Similar behaviour is observed in chemically
peculiar A stars, where strong magnetic fields are responsible for the
enrichment. With this in mind, we obtained circularly polarised spectra of two
of the super-metal-rich sdOBs, two ""normal"" sdBs and two sdOs using FORS1 on
the ESO/VLT. By examining circular polarisation in the hydrogen Balmer lines
and in helium lines, we have detected magnetic fields with strengths of 1-2 kG
in most of our targets. This suggests that such fields are relatively common in
hot subdwarfs.

Generalized symmetries of the model are defined by a groupoid $\Gamma $ given
by the action of a finite group on a space $E$. The geometry of the model is
constructed in terms of suitable (noncommutative) algebras on $\Gamma $. We
investigate observables of the model, especially its position and momentum
observables. This is not a trivial thing since the model is based on a
noncommutative geometry and has strong nonlocal properties. We show that, in
the position representation of the model, the position observable is a
coderivation of a corresponding coalgebra, ""coparallelly"" to the well known
fact that the momentum observable is a derivation of the algebra. We also study
the momentum representation of the model. It turns out that, in the case of the
algebra of smooth, quickly decreasing functions on $\Gamma $, the model in its
""quantum sector"" is nonlocal, i.e., there are no nontrivial coderivations of
the corresponding coalgebra, whereas in its ""gravity sector"" such coderivations
do exist. They are investigated.

different formulations have appeared trying to describe the dynamics and the
quantization of these curious objects. However two of them have gain special
attention among people working on this area: the gauge invariant formulation
proposed by Siegel and the noninvariant one put forward by Floreanini and
Jackiw. We call these distinct analysis as chiral bosonization schemes (CBS).
In this report we make a study of the relationships among many of these
different chiral bosonization schemes. This is done in the context canonical
framework with two different techniques known as soldering formalism and dual
projection formalism. The first considers the phenomenon of interference
between chiral modes and the second is able to separate dynamics from the
symmetry behavior in a quantum field theory. While the soldering formalism
discloses phenomena analogous to the double slit interference phenomena in
classical-quantum physics with important consequences to the bosonization
program, the dual projection, in particular, is able to disclose the presence
of a noton, a nonmover field, in different formulations for chiral bosons. The
importance of this last result is that it proves the duality between Siegel and
Floreanini-Jackiw model without invoking gauge-fixing: while the
Floreanini-Jackiw component describes the dynamics, it is the noton that
carries the symmetry contents, acquiring dynamics upon quantization and is
fully responsible for the Siegel anomaly.

bound states and correlations of the constituents. As a consequence quantum
chromodynamics has a rich phase structure with spontaneous symmetry breaking,
superconductivity, condensates of different kinds. All this appears in many
astrophysical scenarios. Among them is the formation of hadrns during the early
stage of the Universe, the structure of a neutron star, the formation of nuclei
during a supernova explosion. Some of these extreme conditions can be simulated
in heavy ion colliders. To treat such a hot and dense system we use the Green
function formalism of many-body theory. It turns out that a systematic Dyson
expansion of the Green functions leads to modified few-body equations that are
capable to describe phase transitions, condensates, cluster formation and more.
These equations include self energy corrections and Pauli blocking. We apply
this method to nonrelativistic and relativistic matter. The latter one is
treated on the light front. Because of the medium and the inevitable truncation
of space, the few-body dynamics and states depend on the thermodynamic
parameters of the medium.

particle/hole line insertion and two-particle/two-hole

these insertions and formulate iterative equations. We illustrate the dressing
equations in the case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and

highlight a relation to pertinent fourth-order diagrams. We illustrate our
