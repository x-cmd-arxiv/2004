that hydrogen at the photosphere will be burned on an extremely rapid timescale
of hours to years, depending on composition of the underlying material.
Improving on our previous studies, we explore the effect of a maximally thick
""inert"" helium layer, previously thought to slow down the burning rate. Since
hydrogen diffuses faster in helium than through heavier elements, we find this
helium buffer actually increases the burning rate for magnetars. We compute
simple analytic scalings of the burning rate with temperature and magnetic
field for a range of core temperature. We conclude that magnetar photospheres
are very unlikely to contain hydrogen. This motivates theoretical work on heavy
element atmospheres that are needed to measure effective temperature from the
observed thermal emission and constrains models of AXPs that rely on magnetar
cooling through thick light element envelopes.

These configurations are of general relevance to the spectrograph performance.
Benchmarks include spectral resolution, sampling, vignetting, scattered light,
and an estimate of the system absolute throughput. Comparisons are made to
other, existing, fiber feeds on the WIYN Bench Spectrograph. Vignetting and
relative throughput are found to agree with a geometric model of the optical
system. An aperture-correction protocol for spectrophotometric standard-star
calibrations has been established using independent WIYN imaging data and the
unique capabilities of the SparsePak fiber array. The WIYN
point-spread-function is well-fit by a Moffat profile with a constant power-law
outer slope of index -4.4. We use SparsePak commissioning data to debunk a
long-standing myth concerning sky-subtraction with fibers: By properly treating
the multi-fiber data as a ``long-slit'' it is possible to achieve precision sky
subtraction with a signal-to-noise performance as good or better than
conventional long-slit spectroscopy. No beam-switching is required, and hence
the method is efficient. Finally, we give several examples of science
measurements which SparsePak now makes routine. These include H$\alpha$
velocity fields of low surface-brightness disks, gas and stellar
velocity-fields of nearly face-on disks, and stellar absorption-line profiles

brightness profile of stars during the course of a microlensing event than
(line-shaped) fold caustics, the effect of lens binarity significantly limits
the achievable accuracy. Therefore, corresponding close-impact events make a
less favourable case for limb-darkening measurements than those events that
involve fold-caustic passages, from which precision measurements can easily and
routinely be obtained. Examples involving later Bulge giants indicate that a ~
10 % misestimate on the limb-darkening coefficient can result with the
assumption of a single-lens model that looks acceptable, unless the precision
of the photometric measurements is pushed below the 1 %-level even for these
favourable targets. In contrast, measurement uncertainties on the proper motion
between lens and source are dominated by the assessment of the angular radius
of the source star and remain practically unaffected by lens binarity. Rather
than judging the goodness-of-fit by means of a chi^2 test only, run tests
provide useful additional information that can lead to the rejection of models
and the detection of lens binarity in close-impact microlensing events.

consequence of the light proton mass) and they have a demonstrable and often
puzzling influence on many physical properties, including spatial order. To
date, the structure of dense hydrogen remains experimentally elusive. Recent
studies of the melting curve of hydrogen indicate that at high (but
experimentally accessible) pressures, compressed hydrogen will adopt a liquid
state, even at low temperatures. In reaching this phase, hydrogen is also
projected to pass through an insulator-to-metal transition. This raises the
possibility of new state of matter: a near ground-state liquid metal, and its
ordered states in the quantum domain. Ordered quantum fluids are traditionally
categorized as superconductors or superfluids; these respective systems feature
dissipationless electrical currents or mass flow. Here we report an analysis
based on topological arguments of the projected phase of liquid metallic
hydrogen, finding that it may represent a new type of ordered quantum fluid.
Specifically, we show that liquid metallic hydrogen cannot be categorized
exclusively as a superconductor or superfluid. We predict that, in the presence
of a magnetic field, liquid metallic hydrogen will exhibit several phase
transitions to ordered states, ranging from superconductors to superfluids.

alkali-like crystal at sufficiently high pressure. However, some theoretical
models have also suggested that compressed hydrogen may form an unusual
two-component (protons and electrons) metallic fluid at low temperature, or
possibly even a zero-temperature liquid ground state. The existence of these
new states of matter is conditional on the presence of a maximum in the melting
temperature versus pressure curve (the 'melt line'). Previous measurements of
the hydrogen melt line up to pressures of 44 GPa have led to controversial
conclusions regarding the existence of this maximum. Here we report ab initio

changes in the intermolecular interactions lead to a decline of the melt line

compressed, it transforms into a low-temperature quantum fluid before becoming
a monatomic crystal. The emerging low-temperature phase diagram of hydrogen and
its isotopes bears analogies with the familiar phases of 3He and 4He, the only
known zero-temperature liquids, but the long-range Coulombic interactions and

particular at a free surface or at a defect plane. Thereby we consider
nonconserved (model-A) dynamics of a system which is prepared in the
high-temperature phase and quenched into the critical point. Using Monte Carlo
simulations we measure single spin relaxation and autocorrelations, as well as
manifold autocorrelations and persistence. We show that, depending on the decay
of critical static correlations, the short time dynamics can be of two kinds.
For slow decay of local correlations the usual domain growth process takes
place with non-stationary and algebraic dynamical correlations. If, however,
the local correlations decay sufficiently rapidly we have the so called cluster
dissolution scenario, in which case short time dynamical correlations are
stationary and have a universal stretched exponential form. This latter
phenomenon takes place in the surface of the three-dimensional Ising model and
should be observable in real ferromagnets.

applications stem from the unique structure of dendrimers. We present a
theoretical framework based on the master equation within which we describe
these applications. The quantities of interest are the first passage time (FPT)

and its characteristics depend on the geometric and energetic structures of the

properties on the number of generations (dendrimer size), and the system bias.
We present analytical expressions for the FPT PDF for very efficient

first passage time scales linearly with the system length, and fluctuations
around the mean first passage time are negligible for large systems.

superconductors from the point of view of doping a Mott insulator. The basic
electronic structure of the cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of
strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a
starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region
of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where
the behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating
valence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data.
The importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the
transition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal
excitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of
projected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to
implement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of
predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper
deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the
RVB idea on a more formal footing. The slave-boson is introduced to enforce the
constraint of no double occupation. The implementation of the local constraint
leads naturally to gauge theories. We give a rather thorough discussion of the
role of gauge theory in describing the spin liquid phase of the undoped Mott
insulator. We next describe the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero
doping. We show that inclusion of gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable
description of the pseudogap phase.

temperature is considered as a reservoir of gravitons. A cross-section of
interaction of a graviton with any particle is assumed to be a bilinear
function of its energies. Any pair of bodies are attracting not due to an
exchange with its own gravitons, but due to a pressure of external gravitons of
this background. A graviton pairing is necessary to obtain classical gravity.
Any divergencies are not possible in such the model because of natural smooth
cut-offs of the graviton spectrum from both sides. Some cosmological
consequences of this scheme are discussed, too. Also it is shown here that the
main conjecture of this approach may be verified at present on the Earth.

attention to spatially circular orbits and search for observable effects which
could eventually discriminate among the standard supplementary conditions

world line chosen for the multipole reduction and whose unit tangent we denote
as $U$ is a circular orbit then also the generalized momentum $P$ of the
spinning test particle is tangent to a circular orbit even though $P$ and $U$
are not parallel four-vectors. These orbits are shown to exist because the spin
induced tidal forces provide the required acceleration no matter what
supplementary condition we select. Of course, in the limit of a small spin the
particle's orbit is close of being a circular geodesic and the (small)
deviation of the angular velocities from the geodesic values can be of an
arbitrary sign, corresponding to the possible spin-up and spin-down alignment
to the z-axis. When two spinning particles orbit around a gravitating source in
opposite directions, they make one loop with respect to a given static observer
with different arrival times. This difference is termed clock effect. We find
that a nonzero gravitomagnetic clock effect appears for oppositely orbiting
both spin-up or spin-down particles even in the Schwarzschild spacetime. This
allows us to establish a formal analogy with the case of (spin-less) geodesics
on the equatorial plane of the Kerr spacetime. This result can be verified
experimentally.

their physical implications in order to decide which is the most natural to
use. We find that if the particle's center of mass world line, namely the one
chosen for the multipole reduction, is a spatially circular orbit (sustained by
the tidal forces due to the spin) then the generalized momentum $P$ of the test
particle is also tangent to a spatially circular orbit intersecting the center
of mass line at a point. There exists one such orbit for each point of the
center of mass line where they intersect; although fictitious, these orbits are
essential to define the properties of the spinning particle along its physical
motion. In the small spin limit, the particle's orbit is almost a geodesic and
the difference of its angular velocity with respect to the geodesic value can
be of arbitrary sign, corresponding to the spin-up and spin-down possible
alignment along the z-axis. We also find that the choice of the supplementary
conditions leads to clock effects of substantially different magnitude. In
fact, for co-rotating and counter-rotating particles having the same spin
magnitude and orientation, the gravitomagnetic clock effect induced by the
background metric can be magnified or inhibited and even suppressed by the
contribution of the individual particle's spin. Quite surprisingly this
contribution can be itself made vanishing leading to a clock effect
undistiguishable from that of non spinning particles. The results of our
analysis can be observationally tested.

inviscid Burgers equation exhibits finite time blow-up in $H^{\alpha}$, for
$\alpha \ge 1/2$, but its dyadic restriction is even more singular, exhibiting
blow-up for any $\alpha > 0$. Friedlander and Pavlovic developed a closely
related model for which they also prove finite time blow-up in

numerous problems of algebraic geometry and mathematical physics, especially in
relationship with the string theory and Gromov--Witten invariants. In
particular, the classical Hurwitz problem about enumeration of topologically
distinct ramified coverings of the sphere with prescribed ramification type
reduces to the study of geometry and topology of these spaces. The cohomology
rings of such spaces are complicated even in the simplest cases of rational
curves and functions. However, the cohomology classes that are the most
important from the point of view of applications (namely, the classes
Poincar\'e dual to the strata of functions with given singularities) can be
expressed in terms of relatively simple ``basic'' classes (which are, in a
sense, tautological). The aim of the present paper is to identify these basic
classes, to describe relations among them, and to find expressions for the
strata in terms of these classes. Our approach is based on R. Thom's theory of
universal polynomials of singularities, which has been extended to the case of
multisingularities by the first author. Although the general Hurwitz problem
still remains open, our approach allows one to achieve a significant progress
in its solution, as well as in the understanding of the geometry and topology

the structure of the electric field lines. By determining the effective area,
we show the optimal interval of the catalyst metal, which is necessary to

for time independent constraints the virtual displacements are the
displacements allowed by the constraints. However this is not so for a general
time dependent case. For simple physical systems, it is shown that, the work

situations. For allowed displacements however, this is not always true. It is
also demonstrated that when constraint forces do zero work on virtual
displacement, as defined here, we have a solvable mechanical problem. We

of zero virtual work by constraint forces are central to both Lagrange's method

show more than a recurrence of the first excited state. Instead of being
subjected to a rising potential between source and accelerating grid, electrons
are now accelerated in less than one excitation mean-free-path by an extra
grid, and then drift towards the second grid across a large equipotential
region. In this arrangement one must face the difficulty that the space
potential between the grids is strongly modified by space charges. A recent
analysis of this experiment with mercury showed that there is a particular form
of discharge that generates and sustains the ideal design dynamically. The
inevitable variations of potential inside the intergrid volume are then
confined within a narrow sheath, a free double layer, joining two field-free
plasma regions. The position of the double layer can be controlled so as to
optimize the experiment. In the present paper, those phenomena are studied
theoretically in steady-state conditions. The essence of the method is to
specify velocity distributions for electrons and ions and use them to solve the
Poisson equation. Vortex-type functions are used for trapped particles and
mono-energetic beams for free particles. The model explains the change of
position of the double layer and provides a natural explanation of a threshold
condition for its amplitude that governs the transition between two critical
configurations, in accordance with experiment. Stability and minimum
field-energy considerations lead to a unique solution in a four-dimensional
parameter space where the Langmuir ratio is equal to one. The method is
adaptable to other experiments on double layer formation under discharge
conditions and correctly predicts the values of several plasma parameters.

firing rate response is between the weakest and strongest response elicited by
each of the stimuli alone (Reynolds et al, 1999, Journal of Neuroscience
19:1736-1753). When attention is directed towards the stimulus eliciting the
strongest response (the preferred stimulus), the response to the pair is
increased, whereas the response decreases when attention is directed to the
other stimulus (the poor stimulus). These experimental results were reproduced
in a model of a V4 neuron under the assumption that attention modulates the
activity of local interneuron networks. The V4 model neuron received
stimulus-specific asynchronous excitation from V2 and synchronous inhibitory
inputs from two local interneuron networks in V4. Each interneuron network was
driven by stimulus-specific excitatory inputs from V2 and was modulated by a
projection from the frontal eye fields. Stimulus competition was present
because of a delay in arrival time of synchronous volleys from each interneuron
network. For small delays, the firing rate was close to the rate elicited by
the preferred stimulus alone, whereas for larger delays it approached the
firing rate of the poor stimulus. When either stimulus was presented alone the
neuron's response was not altered by the change in delay. The model suggests
that top-down attention biases the competition between V2 columns for control
of V4 neurons by changing the relative timing of inhibition rather than by
changes in the degree of synchrony of interneuron networks. The mechanism
proposed here for attentional modulation of firing rate - gain modulation by
inhibitory interference - is likely to have more general applicability to
cortical information processing.

interactions between atoms and off-resonant light which are known as
paramagnetic Faraday rotation and fictitious magnetic field of light. Since the
projection process, squeezed light, or special interactions among the atoms are
not required in this method, it can be widely applied to many systems. The
attainable range of the squeezing parameter is S^{-2/5}, where S is the total
spin, which is limited by additional fluctuations imposed by coherent light and
the spherical nature of the spin distribution.

using linear optics and arbitrarily fast feedforward based on the continuous
detection of photons. In particular, we systematically derive the so-called
Dolinar scheme that achieves the minimum error discrimination of binary
coherent states. Moreover, we show that the Dolinar-type approach can also be
applied to projection measurements in the regime of photonic-qubit signals. Our
results demonstrate that for implementing a projection measurement with linear
optics, in principle, unit success probability may be approached even without
the use of expensive entangled auxiliary states, as they are needed in all
known (near-)deterministic linear-optics proposals.

"quant-ph/0410134","Marek Kwas","Marek Kwas","Complexity of multivariate Feynman-Kac path integration in randomized
  and quantum settings","20 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The Feynman-Kac path integration problem was studied in the worst case
setting by Plaskota et al. (J. Comp. Phys. 164 (2000) 335) for the univariate
case and by Kwas and Li (J. Comp. 19 (2003) 730) for the multivariate case with
d space variables. In this paper we consider the multivariate Feynman-Kac path
integration problem in the randomized and quantum settings. For smooth
multivariate functions, it was proven in Kwas and Li (2003) that the classical
worst case complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality in d. We show
that in both the randomized and quantum settings the curse of dimensionality is
vanquished, i.e., the number of function evaluations and/or quantum queries
required to compute an e-approximation has a bound independent of d and
depending polynomially on 1/e. The exponents of these polynomials are at most 2
in the randomized setting and at most 1 in the quantum setting. Hence we have
exponential speedup over the classical worst case setting and quadratic speedup
of the quantum setting over the randomized setting. However, both the
randomized and quantum algorithms presented here still require extensive
precomputing, similar to the algorithms of Plaskota et al. (2000) and Kwas and
Li(2003).

systems. The only physical requirement we impose is that phase is complementary
to amplitude. To implement this complementarity we use the notion of mutually
unbiased bases, which exist for dimensions that are powers of a prime. For a
d-dimensional system (qudit) we explicitly construct d+1 classes of maximally
commuting operators, each one consisting of d-1 operators. One of this class
consists of diagonal operators that represent amplitudes (or inversions). By
the finite Fourier transform, it is mapped onto ladder operators that can be
appropriately interpreted as phase variables. We discuss the examples of qubits
and qutrits, and show how these results generalize previous approaches.
