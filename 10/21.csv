amassed carbon fuel on the surface of an accreting neutron star to determine
the conditions under which superbursts occur. We reproduce the general
observational characteristics of superbursts, including burst fluences,
recurrence times, and the absence of superbursts on stars with accretion rates
below 10% of the Eddington limit. By comparing our results with observations,
we are able to set constraints on neutron star parameters such as the stellar
radius and neutrino cooling mechanism in the core. Specifically, we find that
accreting neutron stars with ordered crusts and highly efficient neutrino
emission in their cores (due to direct URCA or pionic reactions, for example)
produce extremely energetic (> 10^44 ergs) superbursts which are inconsistent
with observations, in agreement with previous investigations. Also, because of
pycnonuclear burning of carbon, they do not have superbursts in the range of
accretion rates at which superbursts are actually observed unless the crust is
very impure. Stars with less efficient neutrino emission (due to modified URCA
reactions, for example) produce bursts that agree better with observations.
Stars with highly inefficient neutrino emission in their cores produce bursts
that agree best with observations. All systems that accrete primarily hydrogen
and in which superbursts are observed show evidence of H- and He-burning
delayed mixed bursts. We speculate that delayed mixed bursts provide sufficient
amounts of carbon fuel for superbursts and are thus a prerequisite for having
superbursts. We compare our global stability analysis to approximate one-zone
criteria used by other authors and identify a particular set of approximations
that give accurate results for most choices of parameters. (abstract truncated)

population subtraction methods, we determine the radius at which the cluster
galaxy number density is 200/Omega_m times the mean galaxy density, without
assuming a model for the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters. If these
galaxies are unbiased on Mpc scales, this galaxy-density-based R_200 reflects
the characteristic radii of clusters. We measure the scaling of this
characteristic radius with richness over an order of magnitude in cluster
richness, from rich clusters to poor groups. We use this information to examine
the radial profiles of galaxies in clusters as a function of cluster richness,
finding that the concentration of the galaxy distribution decreases with
richness and is systematically lower than the concentrations measured for dark
matter profiles in N-body simulations. Using these scaled radii, we investigate
the behavior of the cluster luminosity function, and find that it is well
matched by a Schechter function for galaxies brighter than M_r = -18 only after
the central galaxy has been removed. We find that the luminosity function
varies with richness and with distance from the cluster center, underscoring
the importance of using an aperture that scales with cluster mass to compare
physically equivalent regions of these different systems. We note that the
lowest richness systems in our catalog have properties consistent with those
expected of the earliest-forming halos; our cluster-finding algorithm, in
addition to reliably finding clusters, may be efficient at finding fossil

resolve the SEDs of the central engines from the surrounding nebulae. A warm
dust component of several hundred degrees can account for the core emission,
while a cooler component of about 100 K produces the more extended emission
from the bipolar lobes. In every case, the dust mass for the unresolved core
region is orders of magnitude less than that in the extended lobes, raising
doubts that the hypothetical disks in the core could have been responsible for
pinching the waists of the nebulae. We find total masses of roughly 0.5-1 Msun

intermediate-mass progenitor stars. The mass of He2-104's nebula is much lower,

around both M2-9 and Mz3 resembles the distribution of ionized gas. Our images

indicating a transition in $dN/dW_0$ near $W_0 \simeq 0.3$\AA. A combination of
two exponentials reproduces the observed distribution well, suggesting that
MgII absorbers are the superposition of at least two physically distinct
populations of absorbing clouds. We also derive a new redshift parameterization
for the number density of $W_0^{\lambda2796} \ge 0.3$\AA lines:
$N^*=1.001\pm0.132(1+z)^{0.226\pm0.170}$ and $W^*=0.443\pm0.032(1+z)^{0.634\pm

with $W^*$ decreasing from $0.80\pm0.04$\AA at $z=1.6$ to $0.59\pm0.02$\AA at
$z=0.7$. The incidence of moderately strong MgII $\lambda2796$ lines does not
show evidence for evolution with redshift. However, lines stronger than
$\approx 2$\AA show a decrease relative to the no-evolution prediction with
decreasing redshift for $z \lesssim 1$. The evolution is stronger for
increasingly stronger lines. Since $W_0$ in saturated absorption lines is an
indicator of the velocity spread of the absorbing clouds, we interpret this as
an evolution in the kinematic properties of galaxies from moderate to low z.

different ages and assuming that the near-infrared excess in the Herbig Ae/Be

frequency in the age range 3 - 10 Myr in intermediate mass stars is lower than
that in the low mass stars (< 1msun). This indicates that the time-scales for
disk evolution are much shorter in the intermediate mass stars, which could be
a consequence of more efficient mechanisms of inner disk dispersal (viscous
evolution, dust growth and settling toward the midplane).

faint to be observed by FUSE. These star forming systems are potential sources
of Lyman continuum (Lyc) radiation and may contribute to the metagalactic
background radiation that ionizes most of the baryons in the universe. By
measuring the level of Lyc radiation leaking from these galaxies we can
quantify the contribution of stars, relative to quasars, to the ionizing
background at low redshift (0.025 <~ z <~ 0.4) and provide insight into the
reionization processes at high redshift. A meter class instrument with a
moderate spectral dispersion, wide-field, multi-object spectrograph can detect
Lyc leak from a statistically significant number of these galaxies, if the
average escape fraction f_{esc} <~ 1%. Such an instrument will have enormous
discovery potential because of the large number of extra-galactic objects that
exist within its grasp. LyContEx will be scientifically productive, synergistic
with existing surveys, and can be developed into a far ultraviolet mission in
the near future.

large cosmological N-body/SPH simulation. We employ a two-temperature model for
the thermal evolution of the ionized gas, in which the relaxation process
between electrons and ions is explicitly included. In the diffuse, hot IGM, the
relaxation time is comparable to the age of the Universe and hence the electron
temperature in post-shock regions remains significantly smaller than the ion
temperature. We show that, at the present epoch, a large fraction of the
warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) has a well-developed two temperature
structure, with typical temperature differences of order a factor of a few.
Consequently, the fraction of metals in various ionization states such as OVI,
OVII, and OVIII, as well as their line emissivities, can differ locally by more
than an order of magnitude from those computed with a single temperature model.
It is thus necessary to follow the evolution of the electron temperature
explicitly to determine absorption and emission by the WHIM. Although
equipartition is nearly achieved in the denser intracluster medium (ICM), we
find an appreciable systematic deviation between the gas-mass weighted electron
temperature and the mean temperature even at half the virial radii of clusters.
There is thus a reservoir of warm (Te < 1keV) gas in and around massive
clusters. Our results imply that relaxation processes need to be considered in
describing and interpreting observational data from existing X-ray telescopes
as well as from future missions designed to detect the WHIM, such as the
Diffuse Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor and the Missing Baryon Explorer.

the different parts of the disk of the host star in a time dependent manner.
Due to the spin of the star, this produces an asymmetric distortion in the line
profiles of the stellar spectrum, leading to an apparent anomaly of the radial
velocity curves, known as the Rossiter - McLaughlin effect. Here, we derive
approximate but accurate analytic formulae for the anomaly of radial velocity
curves taking account of the stellar limb darkening. The formulae are
particularly useful in extracting information of the projected angle between
the planetary orbit axis and the stellar spin axis, \lambda, and the projected
stellar spin velocity, V sin I_s. We create mock samples for the radial curves
for the transiting extrasolar system HD209458, and demonstrate that constraints
on the spin parameters (V sin I_s, \lambda) may be significantly improved by
combining our analytic template formulae and the precision velocity curves from
high-resolution spectroscopic observations with 8-10 m class telescopes. Thus
future observational exploration of transiting systems using the Rossiter -
McLaughlin effect is one of the most important probes to better understanding
of the origin of extrasolar planetary systems, especially the origin of their
angular momentum.

subsamples to search for dependences of the satellite number density profile,
\rho(r_p), on properties of satellites and primaries. We find significant
differences of the behaviour of \rho(r_p) depending on primary characteristics.
In star-forming primaries, the satellite number density profile is consistent
with power laws within projected distance 20<r_p<500 kpc. On the other hand,
passively star forming primaries show flat profiles for 20<r_p<70 kpc, well
fitted by generalized King models with a large core radius parameter (r_c ~ 68
kpc). In the external regions of the haloes (r_p>100 kpc), the density profiles
of all primaries is well described by power laws, although we notice that for
red, early spectral type primaries, the outer slope obtained is steeper than
that corresponding to blue, late spectral type ones. We have tested our results
by control samples of galaxies identical to the samples of satellites in
apparent magnitude and projected distance to the primary, but with a large
relative velocity. This sample of unphysical primary-galaxy pairs shows a flat
radial density beyond r_p=20 kpc indicating that our results are not biased
toward a decrease of the true number of objects due to catalogue selection
effects. Our results can be understood in terms of dynamical friction and tidal
stripping on satellites in the primary haloes. These processes can effectively
transfer energy to the dark matter, flattening the central steep profiles of
the satellite distribution in evolved systems.

However, there are several astrophysical processes that could, in principle,
affect the measurements and in order to be able to take advantage of the
growing supernova statistics, the control of systematic effects is crucial. We
discuss two of these; extinction due to intergalactic grey dust and dimming due
to photon-axion oscillations and show how their effect on supernova
observations can be constrained using observed quasar colours and spectra. For
a wide range of intergalactic dust models, we are able to rule out any dimming
larger than 0.2 magnitudes for a type Ia supernova at z=1. The corresponding
limit for intergalactic Milky Way type dust is 0.03 mag. For the more
speculative model of photons mixing with axions, we find that the effect is
independent of photon energy for certain combinations of parameter values and a
dimming as large as 0.6 magnitudes cannot be ruled out. These effects can have
profound implications for the possibility of constraining dark energy
properties using supernova observations.

Microquasars belong to the much larger class of X-ray binary systems, where
there exists a compact object together with its X-ray emitting accretion disc,
but the relativistic jet is missing. When does an X-ray binary system evolve
into a microquasar? Ideal for studying such kind of a transition is the
periodic microquasar LS I +61303 formed by a compact object accreting from the
equatorial wind of a Be star and with more than one event of super-critical
accretion and ejection along the eccentric orbit. For ejections at periastron
passage the relativistic electrons suffer severe inverse Compton losses by
upscattering the UV photons of the Be star at high energy: At periastron
passage Gamma-ray emission has been observed, whereas radio outbursts have
never been observed in 20 years of radio flux monitoring. For ejections
displaced from periastron passage the losses are less severe and radio
outbursts are observed. The radio emission mapped on scales from a few AU to
hundreds of AU shows a double-sided relativistic (beta=0.6c) S-shaped jet,
similar to the well-known precessing jet of SS 433.

both sides of a central core (Massi et al. 2004) in all evidence has shown the
occurrence of accretion/ejection processes in this system. However, the radio
outbursts do not occur at periastron passage, where the accretion is at its

that hole-doping is much more effective to broaden the excitations along the

much with increasing temperature or doping although the anisotropic interaction
and the interchain interaction are reduced. In the spin-glass phase ($x$=1.5)

anisotropy in the magnetic behavior. However, interestingly, the rho(T) plots
are found to be essentially isotropic, with the data revealing possible
formation of magnetic superzone formation below 7 K.

not depend on the B powder size. On the other hand, the upper limit of the

below 750 C for NanoB-MgB2, much lower than 980 C for the MgB2 prepared using

with the sample directly sintered at 650 C < TN, an interesting, irreversible

that such anomalous I(V) curves are due to the sharp increase of \rho(T) of

with similar \rho(T) should produce similar hysteretic I(V) curves. As example

Compared to semiconductor microelectronics, modeling transport in
single-molecule devices is much more difficult due to the necessity of
including the effects of the device electronic structure and the interface to
the external contacts at the microscopic level. Theoretical formulation of the
problem therefore requires integrating the knowledge base in surface science,
electronic structure theory, quantum transport and device modeling into a
single unified framework starting from the first-principles. In this paper, we
introduce the theoretical framework for modeling single-molecule electronics
and present a simple conceptual picture for interpreting the results of
numerical computation. We model the device using a self-consistent matrix
Green's function method that combines Non-Equilibrium Green's function theory
of quantum transport with atomic-scale description of the device electronic
structure. We view the single-molecule device as ""heterostructures"" composed of
chemically well-defined atomic groups, and analyze the device characteristics
in terms of the charge and potential response of these atomic groups to
perturbation induced by the metal-molecule coupling and the applied bias
voltage. We demonstrate the power of this approach using as examples devices
formed by attaching benzene-based molecules of different size and internal
structure to the gold electrodes through sulfur end atoms.

the singularity at r=0 typical of the RN metric is removed (ii), matching is
smooth. Such a construction could be viewed as a classical model of an
elementary particle balanced by its own forces without support by an external
agent. One choice is the Minkowski interior that goes back to the old Vilenkin
and Fomin's idea who claimed that in this case the bare delta-like stresses at
the horizon vanish if the RN metric is extremal. However, the relevant entity
here is the integral of these stresses over the proper distance which is
infinite in the extremal case. As a result of the competition of these two
factors, the Lanczos tensor does not vanish and the extremal RN cannot be glued
to the Minkowski metric smoothly, so the elementary-particle model as a ball
empty inside fails. We examine the alternative possibility for the extremal RN
metric - gluing to the Bertotti-Robinson (BR) metric. For a surface placed
outside the horizon there always exist bare stresses but their amplitude goes
to zero as the radius of the shell approaches that of the horizon. This limit
realizes the Wheeler idea of ""mass without mass"" and ""charge without charge"".

in the classical phi^4 theory in 3+1 spacetime dimensions. The non-equilibrium
dynamics is studied by numerically solving the equations of motion in a light-
cone-like discretization of the model for a broad range of initial conditions
and energy densities.A smooth cascade of energy towards the ultraviolet is
found to be the basic mechanism of thermalization.After an initial transient
stage,at a time scale of several hundreds inverse masses,the squared of the
field gradient becomes larger than the nonlinear term and a stage of universal
cascade emerges. As the cascade progresses, the modes with higher wavenumbers
exhibit weaker and weaker nonlinearities well described by the Hartree
approximation while the infrared modes retain strong selfinteractions. Two
timescales for equilibration appears.For k^2><phi^2>(t) we observe an effective
thermalization with a time scale in the thousands of inverse masses and the
Hartree approximation holds. By effective thermalization we mean that the
observable acquires the equilibrium functional form with an effective time
dependent temperature Teff, which slowly decreases with time. Infrared modes
with k^2 < <phi^2>(t) equilibrate only by time scales in the millions of
inverse masses. Infrared modes with k^2 < <phi^2>(t) equilibrate only by time
scales in the millions.Virialization and the equation of state start to set
much earlier than effective thermalization.The applicability of these results
in quantum field theory for large occupation numbers and small coupling is
analyzed.

statistics and reduction of systematic errors in the currently operating solar
and KamLAND experiments, are summarised. The potential of LowNu $\nu-e$ elastic
scattering experiment, designed to measure the $pp$ solar neutrino flux, for
high precision determination of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$, is investigated in detail.
The accuracy in the measurement of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$, which can be achieved
in a reactor experiment with a baseline $L \sim (50-70)$ km, corresponding to a
Survival Probability MINimum (SPMIN), is thoroughly studied. We include the
effect of the uncertainty in the value of $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ in the analyses.
A LowNu measurement of the $pp$ neutrino flux with a 1% error would allow to
determine $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ with an error of 14% (17%) at 3$\sigma$ from a
two-generation (three-generation) analysis. The same parameter
$\sin^2\theta_{12}$ can be measured with an uncertainty of 2% (6%) at 1$\sigma$
(3$\sigma$) in a reactor experiment with $L \sim60 $ km, statistics of $\sim$60
GWkTy and systematic error of 2%. For the same statistics, the increase of the
systematic error from 2% to 5% leads to an increase in the uncertainty in
$\sin^2\theta_{12}$ from 6% to 9% at 3$\sigma$. The inclusion of the
$\sin^2\theta_{13}$ uncertainty in the analysis changes the error on
$\sin^2\theta_{12}$ to 3% (9%). The effect of $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ uncertainty
on the $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ measurement in both types of experiments is
considerably smaller than naively expected.

its deviation from maximal mixing is related to the smallness of the ratio
between the solar and atmospheric mass scales. There is also a common origin
for the small values of the solar and reactor angles, but the later is much
smaller due the large mass ratio between the lightest two neutrinos. There is a
high dependence of the neutrino mass differences on the scalar mass $m_0$ and
the gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$, but a smaller one of the mixing angles on the same
sugra parameters. Measurements of branching ratios for the neutralino decays

averages in disordered systems. Among others, this method has been applied to
the theory of S-matrix fluctuations, the theory of universal conductance
fluctuations and the microscopic spectral density of the QCD Dirac operator. We
start this series of lectures with a general review of Random Matrix Theory and
the statistical theory of spectra. An elementary introduction of the
supersymmetric method in Random Matrix Theory is given in the second and third
lecture. We will show that a Random Matrix Theory can be rewritten as an
integral over a supermanifold. This integral will be worked out for the
Gaussian Unitary Ensemble that describes systems with broken time reversal
invariance. We especially emphasize the role of symmetries. As a second example
of the application of the supersymemtric method we discuss the calculation of
the microscopic spectral density of the QCD Dirac operator. which is known to
be given by chiral Random Matrix Theory. Also in this case we use symmetry
considerations to rewrite the generating function for the resolvent as an
integral over a supermanifold. The main topic of the second last lecture is the
recent developments on the relation between the supersymmetric partition
function and the Toda lattice hierarchy. We will show that this relation is an
efficient way to calculate superintegrals. Finally, we will discuss the
quenched QCD Dirac spectrum at nonzero chemical potential. Because of the
nonhermiticity of the Dirac operator the usual supersymmetric method has not
been successful in this case. However, we will show that the supersymmetric
partition function can be evaluated by means of the replica limit of the Toda
lattice equation.

  We prove that the finite dimensional nest representations separate the points
in $\flgee$, and a fortiori, in $\T^{+}(G)$. The irreducible finite dimensional
representations separate the points in $\flgee$ if and only if $G$ is
transitive in components (which is equivalent to being semisimple). Also the
upper triangular nest representations separate points if and only if for every
vertex $x \in \V(G)$ supporting a cycle, $x$ also supports at least one loop
edge.
  We also study \textit{faithful} nest representations. We prove that $\flgee$
(or $\T^{+}(G)$) admits a faithful irreducible representation if and only if
$G$ is strongly transitive as a directed graph. More generally, we obtain a
condition on $G$ which is equivalent to the existence of a faithful nest

plane. The development of this theory was started (in different terminology) by
the Moscow topology group in early 1980s. It was motivated by the needs of
solid state physics, as a partial (nongeneric) case of Hamiltonian foliations
of Fermi surfaces with multivalued Hamiltonian function. The unexpected
discoveries of their topological properties that were made in 1980s and 1990s
have finally led to nontrivial physical conclusions along the lines of the
so-called geometric strong magnetic field limit. A very fruitful new point of
view comes from the reformulation of that problem in terms of quasiperiodic
functions and an extension to higher dimensions made in 1999. One may say that,
for single crystal normal metals put in a magnetic field, the semiclassical
trajectories of electrons in the space of quasimomenta are exactly the level
lines of the quasiperiodic function with three quasiperiods that is the
dispersion relation restricted to a plane orthogonal to the magnetic field.
General studies of the topological properties of levels of quasiperiodic
functions on the plane with any number of quasiperiods were started in 1999
when certain ideas were formulated for the case of four quasiperiods. The last
section of this work contains a complete proof of these results. Some new
physical applications of the general problem were found recently.

This property can be described in an elementary geometric way; for example:
consider the two compositions (2,7,8,2,0,0) and (5,1,2,5,3,3), then the
respective ranks, permutations of the index set {1,2,...,6} sorting the

parameter of spatial dispersion b2=VTe2/c2 is very small (b2<10-6), dispersion
characteristics of the upper hybrid plasma waves is found to be strongly
modified by the thermal motion of plasma electrons. Indeed, the resonance
cone-like dispersion of UH plasma waves has been observed only if the parameter
range satisfies simultaneously two inequalities: wc<w<2wc, wp<w<wuh. In this
parameter range, the maximal refractive index in the resonant directions has
been found to be limited by nmax~15; new UH mode with its dispersion determined
by conical refraction has been found in the vicinity of the upper hybrid
resonance (w=wuh). Wave dispersion at w<2wc, wp<w<wuh does not correspond to
the cold plasma approximation and is determined by thermal plasma waves
propagating along the ambient magnetic field. Special attention is given to the
wave propagation characteristics in the vicinity of the electron cyclotron
resonance. An interesting effect of reduced electron cyclotron damping has been
observed when two electromagnetic waves (w1=wc, w2=wc+Dw) propagate
simultaneously with Dw approximately equal to the lower hybrid frequency. This
effect can be explained as a three-wave parametric process, analogous to the
effect of electromagnetically induced transparency in three-level atomic
system. Reduced electron cyclotron damping is extensively studied as a function
of the beat frequency and the amplitude of the pump wave. Possible applications

evolution and nonlinear saturation of the magnetic curvature driven
Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability. The model set of coupled nonlinear equations
evolve the scalar electric field potential $\phi$, plasma density $n$ and the
parallel component of the magnetic vector potential $\psi$. The simulations
have been carried out in two limits, (i) a low resistivity case in which RT is
the only linearly growing mode, and (ii) a high resistivity case where the
drift wave is unstable and for which the magnetic curvature parameter is set to
zero to ensure the absence of the RT growth. Our simulations show nonlinear
stabilization in both these limits. The stabilization mechanism is similar to
that observed in earlier two dimensional simulations, namely the generation of
zonal shear flows which decorrelate the radially extended unstable modes.
However the nature of the saturated nonlinear state in the 3d case differs from
that of 2d in some important ways such as by having significant levels of power
in short scales and by the presence of electromagnetic fluctuations. Though, in
the linear regime the electromagnetic effects reduce the growth rates, in the
nonlinear regime their presence hinders the process of stabilization by
inhibiting the process of zonal flow formation. Thus the parameter regime for
which nonlinear stabilization takes place is considerably reduced in three
dimensions.

by means of ECE and SXR diagnostics during non-inductively driven discharges on
Tore Supra. These oscillations are sustained by LHCD, do not have a helical
structure and, therefore, cannot be ascribed as MHD phenomena. The most
probable explanation of this oscillating regime (O-regime) is the assumption
that the plasma current density (and, thus, the q-profile) and the electron
temperature evolve as a non-linearly coupled predator-pray system. The
integrated modelling code CRONOS has been used to demonstrate that the coupled
heat transport and resistive diffusion equations admit solutions for the
electron temperature and the current density which have a cyclic behaviour.
Recent experimental results in which the O-regime co-exists with MHD modes will
be presented. Because both phenomena are linked to details of the q-profile,
some interplay between MHD and oscillations may occur. The localisation of
magnetic islands allows to obtain an accurate picture of the q-profile in the
plasma core. In some case, MHD-driven reconnection helps in maintaining a
weakly inverted q-profile that is found to be, in the CRONOS simulations, a
necessary condition to trigger the oscillations.

toroidal force-free plasma having circular cross section is developed. The
method is quite general and can be applied to any circular low-beta plasma once
suitable boundary conditions are imposed. In particular, due to its
characteristics, it is appropriate for describing the Reversed Field Pinch
(RFP) configuration. The curvilinear metric of the toroidal geometry is
described by adopting flux co-ordinates, and the magnetic field is expressed by
the contravariant representation with two independent potentials. The method
leads to a system of Newcomb-like equations in the two independent potentials
for modes with the same toroidal n-number and poloidal mode number m coupled by
toroidicity. The advantage of this description is that the potentials together
with the metric coefficients can be related in a straightforward manner to the
magnetic field. Moreover it is formally simple and maintains a similarity with
the cylindrical treatment. Indeed it is customary in RFPs to approach the
analysis of MHD instabilities by using cylindrical geometry. Nonetheless the
effect of a more realistic toroidal geometry can play an important role, and
indeed by applying the method to the Reversed Field eXperiment (RFX) plasma we
found that the toroidal effects on the magnetic perturbations are not

for the measurement of the length of collection region of photodetached

probe is thicker than about 0.1 mm, modification of the temporal evolution of
the LPD signal is observed. By making use of the modification, we evaluated
sheath thickness around a cylindrical probe in the existence of the magnetic
field of 15 mT. It was found that the thickness of electron sheath along the
magnetic field was comparable to the calculated plane-parallel Child-Langmuir
sheath thickness when the probe-bias voltage was high. Furthermore, by
inserting a small screening object in the laser beam channel, we can measure
the sheath thickness from the modification of LPD signal. From the variation of
the signal intensity as scanning the screening object perpendicular to the

and $3\omega$ is reported. By numerically solving the full Maxwell-Bloch
equations beyond the slowly-varying envelope and rotating-wave approximations
in the time domain, the nonlinear coupling to the optical field at frequency
$5\omega$ is found to depend critically on the initial relative phase $\phi$ of
the two propagating pulses; the coupling is enhanced when the pulses interfere
constructively in the center ($\phi=0$), while it is nearly suppressed when
they are out of phase ($\phi=\pi$). The tuning of the initial absolute phase of
the different frequency components of synchronously propapagating
$\omega$-$3\omega$ femtosecond pulses can serve as a means to control coherent
anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) processes.

escape degradation in a functionless pseudogene, any gene duplicate needs to be
guarded by negative (purifying) selection from otherwise inevitable fixation of
degenerative mutations. In the present study we focus on the evolutionary stage
at which new duplicates come under such surveillance.
  Our analyses of several genomes indicate that in about 10% gene pairs,
selection begins to guard a new gene copy very soon after a duplication event
whereas the vast majority (90%) of extra genes remain redundant and
unrecognised by selection. Such duplicates accumulate all mutations (including
degenerative) in neutral fashion and are actually destined to become
pseudogenes. We revealed this ""two-stream"" evolutionary pattern by the analysis
of mutations in 2nd versus 3rd codon positions but not by the routinely used
ratio of amino acid replacements (R) versus silent substitutions (S), i.e. the
'2nd vs. 3rd' metric proved to be more resolving than the traditional 'R vs. S'
one for distinguishing neutrally evolving future pseudogenes from their
functional counterparts controlled by negative selection.
  In gene databases for large genomes, hundreds of future pseudogenes are
annotated as functional genes because they do look like intact and valuable by
standard criteria, including even active transcription and translation.
Apparently, these ""pseudogenes-to-be"" over-cloud and mimic those very
infrequent gene duplicates with increased sequence evolution rates driven by
positive selection.

tighten the connection by replacing the real and complex number basis of
physical theories by sets R_{n},C_{n} of length 2n finite binary string
numbers. The form of the numbers in R_{n} is based on the infinite hierarchy of
2n figure outputs from measurements of any physical quantity with an infinite
range (distance, energy, etc.). A space and time based on these numbers is
described. It corresponds to an infinite sequence of spherical scale sections
R_{n,e} (e an integer). Each section has the same number of points but the size
increases exponentially with increasing e. The sections converge towards an
origin which is a space singularity. Iteration of an order preserving
transformation, F_{<} or its inverse shows exponential expansion or contraction
of the space with the origin as a source or sink of space points. The
suitability of R_{n} space as a framework for inflationary cosmology is based
on a constant iteration rate for F_{<} and time dependent e and n=n(t). At t=0
all space is restricted to a region of scale sections R_{n_{0},e} with n_{0}
(small) and e\leq e_{0} (negative). Inflation, which occurs naturally, is
stopped automatically at time t_{I} by increasing n from n_{0} to n_{I}>>n_{0}.
Here n_{I} is such that the outermost \Delta scale sections of R_{n_{0}} space,
which are moving at velocities >c at time t_{I}, are contained in the scale
section R_{n_{I},0} of R_{n_{I}} space. This is needed if R_{n_{I},0} space is
to be similar to the usual R space. Hubble expansion and the redshift are
accounted for by a continuing slow increase in n. Comparison with experimental
data suggests that the rate of increase must be at least one n unit every 30-60
million years.
