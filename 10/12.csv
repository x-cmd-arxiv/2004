re-analyzed. We found evidence for a new periodicity that we interpret as a
superhump in Algol, in which it may have been expected according to its
semi-detached nature and low binary mass ratio. This is the first detection of
the superhump phenomenon in the radio and the first observation of superhumps
in Algol systems. According to our result, the accretion disk in Algol
precesses in spite of its non-Keplerian nature and therefore this phenomenon is
not restricted to the classical Keplerian disks in compact binaries.We propose
that in Algol systems with short orbital periods, the disk is magnetically
active as well as the secondary star. The magnetic field in the disk originates
from amplification of the seed field in the magnetized material transferred
from the secondary. The disk and stellar fields interact with each other, with
reconnection of the field lines causing flares and particle acceleration.
Relativistic particles are trapped in the field and directed toward the polar
regions of the secondary star because of the dipole structure of its magnetic
field. Our proposed model for the magnetic activity in Algol systems provides a
simple explanation to the observed properties of Algol in the radio
wavelengths, and to the presence of quiescent gyrosynchrotron emission near the
polar region of the secondary star, where electrons are difficult to be
confined if the field lines are open as in normal single magnetic stars. We
propose that the superhump variation in the radio is generated by enhanced
reconnection when the elongated side of the elliptic disk is the closest to the
cool star. This leads to flares and enhancement in particle acceleration and is
manifested as stronger gyrosynchrotron radiation.

fast magnetosonic waves propagating across an applied non-uniform magnetic
field can parametrically amplify the Alfv\'en waves propagating along the field
through the periodical variation of the Alfv\'en speed. The resonant Alfv\'en
waves have half the frequency and the perpendicular velocity polarization of
the fast waves. The wavelengths of the resonant waves have different values
across the magnetic field, due to the inhomogeneity in the Alfv\'en speed.
Therefore, if the medium is bounded along the magnetic field, then the
harmonics of the Alfv\'en waves, which satisfy the condition for onset of a
standing pattern, have stronger growth rates. In these regions the fast
magnetosonic waves can be strongly 'absorbed', their energy going in
transversal Alfv\'en waves. We refer to this phenomenon as 'Swing Absorption'.
This mechanism can be of importance in various astrophysical situations.

statistics to a large sample of XRBs and AGN, we derive a limit on the width of

X-rays are unbeamed (e.g., if they originate in the accretion disk or in the
slower, innermost part of the jet), the width of the \beta\Gamma distribution
should be about one order of magnitude or less. If the scatter about the
``fundamental plane'' is entirely dominated by relativistic beaming, a lower
limit on the mean Lorentz factor <\beta\Gamma> > 5 can be derived. On the other

full size galactic disks, hosting a double inner Lindblad resonance. Becoming
increasingly massive and self-gravitating, the nuclear bars lose internal

Developing chaos within these bars triggers a rapid gas collapse -- bar
contraction. During this time period, the secondary bar pattern speed
Omega_s~a^{-1}, where ""a"" stands for the bar size. As a result, Omega_s
increases dramatically until a new equilibrium is reached (if at all), while
the gas specific angular momentum decreases -- demonstrating the dynamical

to be a necessary condition for the prograde decoupling of nested bars. This
process maintains an inflow rate of ~1 M_o/yr over ~10^8 yrs across the central

that magnetic fields external to, but concentrated near, the surface of the
cloud suppress the growth of destructive hydrodynamic instabilities. External
fields also increase the compression of the cloud by effectively acting as a
confinement mechanism driven by the interstellar flow and local field
stretching. This can have a dramatic effect on both the efficiency of radiative
cooling, which tends to increase with increasing magnetic field strength, and
on the size and distribution of condensed cooled fragments. In contrast, fields
acting predominately internally to the cloud tend to resist compression,
thereby inhibiting cooling. We observe that, even at modest strengths, internal
fields can completely suppress low-temperature cooling.

photographic photometry, with typical error sigma_(U-B)=0.38. Spectroscopic
detection of the Ca II K line in color-selected candidates was thought to
indicate that a metal-weak cool star (sdF-sdG) had entered the list owing to
photometric errors. About 1100 such ""K-line"" stars were rejected on this basis
from the final published PG catalogue, as not having ""genuine"" UV excesses.
However, another possibility is that some of these objects are composite
(binary) stars, consisting of a hot subdwarf (sdB or sdO) and a cool companion
(F-G-K).
  Recent interest in binary-star formation channels for sdB stars in particular
has brought renewed attention to the issue of completeness of lists of known
hot subdwarfs, especially ones with cool companions. We have studied the nature
of the ""rejected"" PG candidate stars, by assembling available information for a
subset of 173 stars between r magnitudes 14.0 and 16.0 that have photometric
data from both Data Release 2 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the
Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Two of the stars have SDSS spectra. Both
from their location in (u-g,g-r) and (g-r,r-K_s) two-color diagrams and from
detailed fitting of single-star models to the spectral energy distributions, we
conclude that the vast majority of these stars can be interpreted as metal-poor
F and G subdwarfs, consistent with the original interpretation by the authors
of the PG survey. We discuss the seven outliers individually; these may
plausibly be binary systems that include a hot subdwarf star as a member, or
they are hot stars that entered the list of rejected stars by accident.

comparing the inner rotation curves of the galaxies with the velocity at large

predicted ones. In light of these results we conclude that in a typical galaxy

luminosity upper limits (corresponding to $L_x\mincir 5\times 10^{42}$ ergs/sec

structures, these galaxy aggregations correspond to poor groups of galaxies.
Using the SDSS photometric catalogue we also derive the cluster optical
$r$-band luminosities. The resulting scaling relations ($L_{\rm opt}-L_x$,
$L_{\rm opt}-T_x$) are consistent with those of other recent studies.

confirm the earlier finding that in the first phase of mass transfer in the
binary evolution leading to a close pair of white dwarfs, the standard
common-envelope formalism equating the energy balance in the system, does not
work. An algorithm equating the angular momentum balance can explain the
observations. This conclusion is now based on ten observed systems rather than
three. With the latter algorithm the separation does not change much for
approximately equal mass binaries. Assuming constant efficiency in the standard
\alpha-formalism and a constant value of \gamma, we investigate the effect of
both methods on the change in separation in general and conclude that when
there is observational evidence for strong shrinkage of the orbit, the
\gamma-algorithm also leads to this. We then extend our analysis to all close
binaries with at least one white dwarf component and reconstruct the mass
transfer phases that lead to these binaries. We find that all observations can
be explained with a single value of \gamma, making the \gamma-algorithm a
useful tool to predict the outcome of common-envelope evolution. We discuss the

delocalization transition of a thin Ising film with antisymmetric competing
walls for a set of parameters where the transition is strongly first-order.
This is achieved by estimating the density of states (DOS) of the model by
means of Wang-Landau sampling (WLS) in the space of energy, using both,
single-spin-flip as well as N-fold way updates. From the DOS we calculate
canonical averages related to the configurational energy, like the internal
energy, the specific heat, as well as the free energy and the entropy. By
sampling microcanonical averages during simulations we also compute
thermodynamic quantities related to magnetization like the reduced fourth order
cumulant of the order parameter. We estimate the triple temperatures of
infinitely large systems for three different film thicknesses via finite size
scaling of the positions of the maxima of the specific heat, the minima of the
cumulant and the equal weight criterion for the energy probability
distribution. The wetting temperature of the semi-infinite system is computed
with help of the Young equation. In the limit of large film thicknesses the
triple temperatures are seen to converge towards the wetting temperature of the
corresponding semi-infinite Ising model in accordance with standard capillary
wave theory. We discuss the slowing down of WLS in energy space as observed for
the larger film thicknesses and lateral linear dimensions. In case of WLS in
the space of total magnetization we find evidence that the slowing down is
reduced and can be attributed to persisting free energy barriers due to shape
transitions.

superconductivity universality classes which fall into two main categories:
conventional superconductors with their vortex excitations and unconventional
superconductors. These are characterized by a broken $U(1)_{\rm vector} \otimes
U(1)_{\rm axial}$ symmetry and are labeled by an integer level $m$. They
possess neutral spinon excitations of fractional spin and statistics $S =
{\theta \over 2\pi} = {{m-1} \over 2m}$ which carry also an $SU(m)$ isospin
quantum number; this hidden $SU(m)$ symmetry implies that these anyon
excitations are non-Abelian. The simplest unconventional superconductor is
realized for $m=2$: in this case the spinon excitations are semions
(half-fermions). My results show that spin-charge separation in 2D
superconductivity is a universal consequence of the infinite symmetry of the
ground state. This infinite symmetry and its superselection rules realize a
quantum protectorate in which the neutral spinons can survive even as soft

in the past, while investigating the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU)
models. A first result is the numerical evidence of the existence of two
different kinds of transitions in the dynamics of the FPU models: i) a
Stochasticity Threshold (ST), characterized by a value of the energy per degree
of freedom below which the overwhelming majority of the phase space
trajectories are regular (vanishing Lyapunov exponents). It tends to vanish as
the number N of degrees of freedom is increased. ii) a Strong Stochasticity
Threshold (SST), characterized by a value of the energy per degree of freedom
at which a crossover appears between two different power laws of the energy
dependence of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which phenomenologically
corresponds to the transition between weakly and strongly chaotic regimes. It
is stable with N. A second result is the development of a Riemannian geometric
theory to explain the origin of Hamiltonian chaos. The starting of this theory
has been motivated by the inadequacy of the approach based on homoclinic
intersections to explain the origin of chaos in systems of arbitrarily large N,
or arbitrarily far from quasi-integrability, or displaying a transition between
weak and strong chaos.
  Finally, a third result stems from the search for the transition between weak
and strong chaos in systems other than FPU.
  Actually, we found that a very sharp SST appears as the dynamical counterpart
of a thermodynamic phase transition, which in turn has led, in the light of the
Riemannian theory of chaos, to the development of a topological theory of phase
transitions.

temperature in DC. Because of the nonlinearity of the electron-phonon coupling
with respect to temperature, even the DC response will be affected, when the

the GP equations. The various limitations of these equations as used on dilute
inhomogeneous condensed Boson atomic gases are then summarized, reference also
being made to the fact that there is no many-body wave function underlying the

thereby removed, though it is a matter of further study to determine whether a
correlated wave function exists as underpinning for the integral equation

-1. When $\alpha=2$, the kinetic energy $\rho_k$ and the coupling energy

considered with a focus on understanding the difference between large $N_c$ QCD
with an isospin chemical potential and large $N_c$ QCD with a baryon chemical
potential. A simple diagrammatic analysis analogous to `t Hooft's analysis at
$\mu=0$ implies that the free energy with a given baryon chemical potential is
equal to the free energy with an isospin chemical potential of the same value
plus $1/N_c$ corrections. Phenomenologically, these two systems behave quite
differently. A scenario to explain this difference in light of the diagrammatic
analysis is explored. This scenario is based on a phase transition associated
with pion condensation when the isospin chemical potential exceeds $m_\pi/2$;
associated with this transition there is breakdown of the $1/N_c$ expansion--in
the pion condensed phase there is a distinct $1/N_c$ expansion including a
larger set of diagrams. While this scenario is natural, there are a number of
theoretical issues which at least superficially challenge it. Most of these can
be accommodated. However, the behavior of quenched QCD which raises a number of
apparently analogous issues cannot be easily understood completely in terms of
an analogous scenario. Thus, the overall issue remains open.

relaxed. In fact $f_a$ can be as large as the Planck scale, which may enable us

special geometry. We then recover fake supergravity as the effective
description of true supergravity where one restricts the attention to the
flowing scalar field of a given BPS-domain wall. In general, however, true
supergravity can be simulated by fake supergravity at most \emph{locally},
based upon two choices: (i) a suitable adapted coordinate system on the scalar
manifold, such that only one scalar field plays a dynamical role, and (ii) a
gauge fixing of the SU(2) connection on the quaternionic-Kahler manifold, as
this connection does not fit the simple formalism of fake supergravity.

broken to SU(N-1) x U(1) and the dynamics is described by a single N = 2 vector
multiplet corresponding to the U(1) factor of the unbroken group. Using an
off-shell formulation for N = 4 SYM in N = 2 harmonic superspace, within the

to a holomorphic sector of the effective action, which is a supersymmetric
completion of interactions of the form \Omega ((F^+)^2 |Y|^{-4}) (F^+)^2(F^-)^2
|Y|^{-4}, with F^\pm the (anti) self-dual components of the U(1) gauge field
strength, and Y the complex scalar belonging to the vector multiplet. In the
one-loop approximation, \Omega was shown in hep-th/9911221 to be constant. It
is demonstrated in the present paper that \Omega \propto (F^+)^2 |Y|^{-4} at
the two-loop order. The corresponding coefficient proves to agree with the F^6
coefficient in the D3-brane action, after implementing the nonlinear field
redefinition which was sketched in hep-th/9810152 and which relates the N = 2
vector multiplet component fields with those living on the D3-brane. In the

some $g=0$ cases, the amplification with white noise is slightly stronger than
that without white noise. In the $g=0$ cases, the fields are always amplified.
The amplification is maximal at $k_{m} \neq 0$ in some $g=0$ cases. Contrarily,
in the $g = {3 \sqrt{2 \lambda} m}/{2}$ cases, the fields for some finite modes

dimensional three generation model building proposals - using intersecting
D-brane toroidal compactifications [without fluxes] of IIA, IIB string theories
- which have only the SM at low energy. In this context, we focus on these
model building directions, where non-supersymmetric constructions - based on
the existence of the gauge group structure $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times
U(1)_Y$, Pati-Salam $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$, SU(5) and flipped
SU(5) GUTS - appear at the string scale $M_s$. These model building attempts
are based on four dimensional compactifications that use orientifolds of either
IIA theory with D6-branes wrapping on $T^6$, $T^6/Z_3$ and recently on $T^6/Z_3
\times Z_3$ or of IIB theory with D5-branes wrapping on $T^4 \times C/Z_N$.
Models with D5-branes are compatible with the large extra dimension scenario
and a low string scale that could be at the TeV; thus there is no gauge
hierarchy problem in the Higgs sector. In the case of flipped SU(5) GUTS -
coming from $T^6/Z_3$ - the special build up structure of the models
accommodates naturally a see-saw mechanism and a new solution to the
doublet-triplet splitting problem. Baryon number is a gauged symmetry and thus
proton is naturally stable only in models with D5 branes or in models with
D6-branes wrapping toroidal orientifolds of type IIA. Finally, we present new
RR tadpole solutions for the 5- and 6- stack toroidal orientifold models of
type IIA which have only the Standard Model with right handed neutrinos at low

surface in M in which each component is incident to N and no component is a

complex for N represented by boundaries of compressing disks and by boundary
components of Q.
  Theorem: Suppose Q is essential in M, then the distance d(VN, QN) \leq 1 -
\chi(Q).
  Hartshorn showed that an incompressible surface in a closed 3-manifold puts a
limit on the distance of any Heegaard splitting. The theorem above provides a
version of Hartshorn's result for merely compact 3-manifolds.
  In a similar spirit, here is the main result:
  Theorem: Suppose Q is connected, separating and compresses on both its sides,
but not by way of disjoint disks, then either d(VN, QN) \leq 1 - \chi(Q) or Q
is obtained from two nested connected boundary-parallel surfaces by a vertical
tubing.

version of this theorem leads to the same conclusion as in Hartshorn's theorem,
not from an essential surface but from an alternate Heegaard surface. That is,
if Q is a Heegaard splitting of a compact M then then no other irreducible
Heegaard splitting of M has distance greater than twice the genus of Q.

the inertial frame is specified by the rotation matrix, parametrized by a
rotational vector. The approximate solutions of the nonlinear partial
differential equations of motion in quasi-static sense are chosen as the shape
functions with up to third order nonlinear terms of generic nodal
displacements. Based on the Lagrangian constructed by the Cosserat kinetic
energy and strain energy expressions, the principle of virtual work is employed
to derive the ordinary differential equations of motion with third order
nonlinear generic nodal displacements. A simple example is presented to
illustrate the use of the formulation developed here to obtain the lower order
nonlinear ordinary differential equations of motion of a given structure. The
corresponding nonlinear dynamical responses of the structures have been
presented through numerical simulations by Matlab software.

original model in the large c limit. We show that in the BM model, for all c,
the distribution of the asymptotic length of the LCS, suitably scaled, is
identical to the Tracy-Widom distribution of the largest eigenvalue of a random
matrix whose entries are drawn from a Gaussian unitary ensemble. In particular,
in the large c limit, this provides an exact expression for the asymptotic
length distribution in the original LCS problem.

different ``rooms'' of the lab, and before any interaction takes place. In that
case the state of the compound system is necessarily a product state. As a
consequence, Dirac's superposition principle fails, and therefore L_sep cannot
satisfy all Piron's axioms. In previous works, assuming that L_sep is
orthocomplemented, it was argued that L_sep is not orthomodular and fails to
have the covering property. Here we prove that L_sep cannot admit and
orthocomplementation. Moreover, we propose a natural model for L_sep which has
the covering property.

compound systems is far from being clear. In general the information is a
mixture of local, and non-local (""quantum"") information. To make this point
more clear, we develop and investigate the quantum information processing
paradigm in which parties sharing a multipartite state distill local
information. The amount of information which is lost because the parties must
use a classical communication channel is the deficit. This scheme can be viewed
as complementary to the notion of distilling entanglement. After reviewing the
paradigm, we show that the upper bound for the deficit is given by the relative
entropy distance to so-called psuedo-classically correlated states; the lower
bound is the relative entropy of entanglement. This implies, in particular,
that any entangled state is informationally nonlocal i.e. has nonzero deficit.
We also apply the paradigm to defining the thermodynamical cost of erasing
entanglement. We show the cost is bounded from below by relative entropy of
entanglement. We demonstrate the existence of several other non-local
phenomena. For example,we prove the existence of a form of non-locality without
entanglement and with distinguishability. We analyze the deficit for several
classes of multipartite pure states and obtain that in contrast to the GHZ
state, the Aharonov state is extremely nonlocal (and in fact can be thought of
as quasi-nonlocalisable). We also show that there do not exist states, for
which the deficit is strictly equal to the whole informational content (bound
local information). We then discuss complementary features of information in
distributed quantum systems. Finally we discuss the physical and theoretical
meaning of the results and pose many open questions.
