X-ray binary 2S 0921-630 obtained with the Very Large Telescope. We found
sinusoidal radial velocity variations of the companion star with a
semi-amplitude of 99.1+-3.1 km s^-1 modulated on a period of 9.006+-0.007 days,
consistent with the orbital period found before for this source, and a systemic
velocity of 44.4+-2.4 km s^-1. Due to X-ray irradiation the centre-of-light
measured by the absorption lines from the companion star is likely shifted with
respect to the centre-of-mass. We try to correct for this using the so-called
K-correction. Conservatively applying the maximum correction possible and using
the previously measured rotational velocity of the companion star, we find a
lower limit to the mass of the compact object in 2S 0921-630 of M_X sin^3 i >
1.90+-0.25 Msun (1 sigma errors). The inclination in this system is well
constrained since partial eclipses have been observed in X-rays and optical
bands. For inclinations between 60< i<90 degrees we find
1.90+-0.25<M_X<2.9+-0.4 Msun. However, using this maximum K-correction we find
that the ratio between the mass of the companion star and that of the compact
object, q, is 1.32+-0.37 implying super-Eddington mass transfer rates; however,
evidence for that has not been found in 2S 0921-630. We conclude that the
compact object in 2S 0921-630 is either a (massive) neutron star or a low-mass
black hole.

expanding photosphere method (EPM) which yields a distance to SN 1999em that is
50% smaller than the Cepheid distance. We emphasize the differences between

out because of their conspicuous 10^8-9 yr populations. These objects were
called ``Young-TOs'', since they all have TO-like emission line ratios. In this
paper we investigate the radial variations of spectral properties in Low
Luminosity AGN. Our analysis is based on high S/N, 3500-5500 A, long-slit
spectra for 47 galaxies. The data probe distances of typically up to 850 pc
from the nucleus with a resolution of ~ 100 pc and S/N ~ 30. Stellar population
gradients are mapped by the radial profiles of absorption line equivalent
widths and colours along the slit. These variations are further analyzed by
means of a decomposition of each spectrum in terms of template galaxies
representative of very young (<= 10^7 yr), intermediate age (10^8-9 yr) and old
(10^10 yr) populations.
  Our main findings are: (1) Significant stellar population gradients are found
almost exclusively in Young-TOs. (2) The intermediate age population of
Young-TOs, although heavily concentrated in the nucleus, reaches distances of
up to a few hundred pc. (3) Objects with predominantly old populations present
spatially homogeneous spectra, be they LINERs or TOs. (4) Young-TOs have much
more dust in their central regions than other LLAGN. (5) The B-band
luminosities of the central <~ 1 Gyr population in Young-TOs are within an
order of magnitude of M_B = -15, implying masses of order ~ 10^7-10^8 Mo. This
population was 10-100 times more luminous in its formation epoch, at which time
young massive stars would have completely outshone any active nucleus, unless
the AGN too was brighter in the past. (abridged)

from these models are clearly inconsistent with the measured radial velocity

morphologies, with hard (2-10 keV) point sources embedded in diffuse soft

diffuse emission is detected on the scale of the cluster, and 0334-01 (3C 15),

fitted at hard energies by an absorbed powerlaw, with a wide range of photon

likely related to the accretion flow. In an attempt to constrain the nature of

a fitting a synchrotron self-absorption model to the emission spectrum. This
model implies a sub-relativistic ejecta velocity, v ~ 0.2c, and a size of r ~
4.3 x 10^{15} cm at t ~ 10 days. The circumstellar density is suitably fit with
a stellar wind profile, n_e ~ r^{-2} and a constant mass loss rate of M_dot ~
7.5 x 10^{-6} M_{solar}/year. Moreover, the magnetic field follows B ~ r^{-1}
and the kinetic energy of the radio bright ejecta is roughly E ~ 10^{48} erg
assuming equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic
fields. Furthermore, we show that free-free absorption does not contribute
significantly to the radio spectrum, since it implies ejecta velocities which
are inconsistent with size constraints derived from Very Long Baseline Array
observations. In conclusion, we find that although SN 2003L has a radio
luminosity comparable to that seen in SN 1998bw, it shows no evidence for a

to a numerical simulation that is consistent with recent WMAP observations
suggests that galaxies in our samples are associated with dark matter halos of
mass ~ 10^12, and that a small fraction of the halos contain more than one
galaxy that satisfies our selection criteria. Adding recent observations of
galaxy clustering at z~0 and z~1 to the simulation results, we conclude that
the typical object in our samples will evolve into an elliptical galaxy by

intrinsic polarization, with a significant intrinsic polarization of 1% at
5250A, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter distributed in an
asymmetric geometry. The polarization and its position angle are clearly
variable on time scales of hours and nights, in all 3 wavelengths, with a
behavior related to the orbital motion. The variations have the highest
amplitudes seen so far for pre-main-sequence binaries (~1%, ~30deg) and are
sinusoidal with periods similar to the orbital period and half of it. The
polarization variations are generally correlated with the photometric ones:
when the star gets fainter, it also gets redder and its polarization increases.
The color-magnitude diagram B-V, V exhibits a ratio of total to selective
absorption R=4.3 higher than in normal interstellar clouds (R=3.1). The
interpretation of the simultaneous photometric and polarimetric observations is
that a cloud of circumstellar matter passes in front of the star, decreasing
the amount of direct, unpolarized light, and hence increasing the contribution
of scattered (blue) light. We show that the large amplitude of the polarization
variations can not be reproduced with a single scattering model and axially
symmetric circumbinary or circumstellar disks.

as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of
matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies
currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to
collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus, their appearance on
the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them
uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest
things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest
objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial
equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to
determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 10^14 to 10^15
solar masses, and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with
the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of
structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models.
Second, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous
matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active
galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so
deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of
information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the
efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the
resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our
theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic
component of clusters. (Abridged)

galaxy. The host galaxy is undergoing tidal interaction with a nearby
companion, with shells, tidal tails, and knotty star-forming regions all
visible. We analyse the images of the galaxy and its companion pixel-by-pixel,
first using colour-magnitude diagrams, and then fitting stellar population
models to the spectral energy distributions of each pixel. The pixels separate
cleanly in colour-magnitude diagrams, with pixels of different colours
occupying distinct regions of the host galaxy and its companion. We find three
distinct groups of ages: an old population in the outskirts of the host galaxy;
an intermediate-age population around the nucleus and tidal tail, and a young
population in the nucleus and blue ""knots"".
  The correlation of age with position suggests the two most recent episodes
were triggered by tidal interactions with the companion galaxy. The evidence
points to the AGN in the centre of B1221-423 having been ""caught in the act"" of
ignition. However, none of the components we have identified is as young as the

triggering of the AGN is at least 300 My.

rest of the field. All of the sources have a brightness temperature in excess
of 10^5 K; suggesting they are AGN. Optical identifications are available for 8
of the 9 VLBI detections - only VLBI J142906.6095 remains unidentified (I >

significant fraction of these compact radio sources may be located at z > 1.
The VLBI detection rate for sub-mJy radio sources is 8^{+4}_{-5} %. The VLBI
detection rate for mJy sources is higher, 29^{+11}_{-12}%. This trend is
expected if the radio emission associated with fainter sub-mJy and microJy
sources increasingly arises from extended regions of star formation. The 9 VLBI
detections pin-point the precise location of AGN or candidate AGN, and their
VLBI positions can help to anchor the NOAO Bootes field to the ICRF. The
simultaneous detection of several sub-mJy and mJy radio sources, in a single

burst and coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not general characteristics
for impulsive flares. In H$\alpha$ we observed the bright mass ejecta (BME)
followed by drak mass ejecta (DME). Based on the consistence of the onset times
and direction of BME and CME, we conclude that these two phenomena are closely
associated. It is inferred that the energy build-up took place due to
photospheric reconnection between emerging positive parasitic polarity and
predominant negative polarity, which resulted as a consequence of flux
cancellation. The shear increased to $>80^o$ due to further emergence of
positive parasitic polarity causing strongly enhanced cancellation of flux. It
appears that such enhanced magnetic flux cancellation in a strongly sheared
region triggered the impulsive flare.

redshifted lines are intrinsic properties of the powerful outflows that are

inverse Compton emission and of cold fronts and magneto hydrodynamic
simulations. We review the main issues that have led to our knowledge on
magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies. Observations show that cluster fields
are at the $\mu$G level, with values up to tens of $\mu$G at the center of
cooling core clusters. Estimates obtained from different observational
approaches may differ by about an order of magnitude. However, the discrepancy
may be alleviated by considering that the magnetic field is not constant
through the cluster, and shows a complex structure. In particular, the magnetic
field intensity declines with the cluster radius with a rough dependence on the
thermal gas density. Moreover, cluster magnetic fields are likely to fluctuate
over a wide range of spatial scales with values from a few kpc up to hundreds
kpc. Important information on the cluster field are obtained by comparing the
observational results with the prediction from numerical simulations. The
origin of cluster magnetic fields is still debated. They might originate in the
early Universe, either before or after the recombination, or they could have
been deposited in the intracluster medium by normal galaxies, starburst
galaxies, or AGN. In either case, magnetic fields undergo significant
amplification during the cluster merger processes.

three possible periodic driving mechanisms for the origin of helical jet paths,
namely, orbital motion in a binary black hole system (BBHS), jet precession,
and intrinsic jet rotation. It is shown that precessional-driven ballistic
motion is unlikely to result in observable periods of less than several tens of
years. We demonstrate that for non-ballistic helical motion the observed period
is generally strongly shortened relative to the real physical driving period
because of light-travel time effects. Internal jet rotation may thus account
for observed periods $P_{\rm obs} \leq 10$ days. Periodicity due to
orbital-driven (non-ballistic) helical motion, on the other hand, is usually
constrained to periods of $P_{\rm obs} \geq 10$ days, while Newtonian-driven
precession is unlikely to be responsible for periodicity on a timescale $P_{\rm
obs} \leq 100$ days but may well be associated with periods of $P_{\rm obs}
\geq 1$ yr.

while He II reionization was delayed to z ~ 3. Both epochs are in conflict with

been the detection of He II Ly-alpha (Gunn-Peterson) absorption in the spectra
of AGN at redshifts z > 2.03. Spectra of He II absorbers, taken in concert with
corresponding H I (Ly-alpha) lines, allow us to fix the epoch of helium
reionization at z(HeII) ~ 2.8 +/- 0.2. Here, I review FUSE observations of He
II absorption, together with their implications for the sources and transport
of ionizing radiation over 30-50 Mpc distances through the IGM. FUSE
observations of He II absorption toward HE 2347-4342, combined with Keck and
VLT observations of H I, are consistent with photoionization by QSOs, with a
wide range of intrinsic spectral indices, and modified by filtering and
reprocessing in the IGM. The He II/H I ratio (eta) exhibits variations over 1
Mpc distance scales (Delta z ~ 0.001). Intriguingly, this eta-ratio is also
correlated with Ly-alpha filaments and voids. The ionizing radiation field
appears to be softer (higher He II/H I) in the voids. These void regions may be
ionized by local soft sources (dwarf starburst galaxies), or the QSO radiation
may softened by escape from AGN cores and transport through denser regions in
the cosmic web. The differences in ionizing spectra may explain the 1.4 Gyr lag
between H I and He II reionization epochs.

to have a satisfactory model of dark energy, the quintessence field value today
should be as insensible to the initial conditions as possible. Usually, only
the dependence on the initial conditions specified at the end of inflation or,
equivalently, at the beginning of the radiation dominated era, is considered.
Provided the quintessence field is initially within a large but, crucially,
finite interval, its present value becomes independent of the initial value it
started from. The question as to whether inflation naturally drives the
quintessence field to the above-mentioned interval is addressed. Since the
quantum effects turn out to be important, the formalism of stochastic inflation
is used in order to calculate the evolution of the quintessence field.
Moreover, the quantum effects originating from the inflaton field are also
taken into account and are proved to be sub-dominant in most cases. Finally,
the requirement that the quintessence field is on tracks today is shown to
imply quite tight constraints on the initial values of the quintessence and
inflaton fields at the beginning of inflation. In particular, the initial value
of the inflaton field cannot be too large which indicates that the
quintessential scenario seems to be compatible with inflation only if the total
number of e-folds is quite small.

electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated particle
acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating into an

the Weibel instability created in the collisionless shock front accelerates jet
and ambient particles both perpendicular and parallel to the jet propagation
direction. The non-linear fluctuation amplitudes of densities, currents,
electric, and magnetic fields in the electron-positron shock are larger than
those found in the electron-ion shock at the same simulation time. This comes
from the fact that both electrons and positrons contribute to generation of the

responsible for generating and amplifying nonuniform, small-scale (mainly
transverse) magnetic fields which contribute to the electron's (positron's)
transverse deflection behind the jet head. This small scale magnetic field
structure is appropriate to the generation of ``jitter'' radiation from

calculations of the spin Hall conductance in two-dimensional quantum wells in a
strong perpendicular magnetic field. The Rashba coupling, generated by
spin-orbit interaction in wells lacking bulk inversion symmetry, introduces a
degeneracy of Zeeman-split Landau levels at certain magnetic fields. This
degeneracy, if occuring at the Fermi energy, will induce a resonance in the
spin Hall conductance below a characteristic temperature of order of the Zeeman
energy. At very low temperatures, the spin Hall current is highly non-ohmic.
The Dresselhaus coupling due to the lack of structure inversion symmetry
partially or completely suppresses the spin Hall resonance. The condition for
the resonant spin Hall conductance in the presence of both Rashba and
Dresselhaus couplings is derived using a perturbation method. In the presence
of disorder, we argue that the resonant spin Hall conductance occurs when the
two Zeeman split extended states near the Fermi level becomes degenerate due to
the Rashba coupling and that the the quantized charge Hall conductance changes
by 2e^2/h instead of e^2/h as the magnetic field changes through the resonant

  excitable elements arranged on regular networks: effects of network topology","11 pages and 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB",,"  The question of how network topology influences emergent synchronized
oscillations in excitable media is addressed. Coupled van der
Pol-FitzHugh-Nagumo elements arranged either on regular rings or on clusters of
the square lattice are investigated. Clustered and declustered rings are
constructed to have the same number of next-nearest-neighbors (four) and a
number of links twice that of nodes. The systems are chosen to be
close-to-threshold, allowing global oscillations to be triggered by a weak
diversity among the constituents that, by themselves, would be non-oscillating.
The results clearly illustrate the crucial role played by network topology. In
particular we found that network performance (oscillatory behavior and
synchronization) is mainly determined by the network average path length and by
the standard deviation of path lengths. The shorter the average path length and
the smaller the standard deviation, the better the network performance. Local
properties, as characterized by the clustering coefficient, are less important.
In addition we comment on the mechanisms that sustain synchronized oscillations
and on the transient times needed to reach these stationary regimes.

as the capillary keeps its linear shape, we show that a nonzero chiral
cholesteric pitch favors the SmA*-SmC* transition. However, neither the
cholesteric pitch nor the presence of an intrinsic bending stress are able to
give rise to a curved capillary shape.
  The key ingredient for the telephone-cord instability is spontaneous
polarization. The free energy minimizer of a spontaneously polarized SmA* is
attained on a planar capillary, characterized by a nonzero curvature. More
interestingly, in the SmC* phase the combined effect of the molecular tilt and
the spontaneous polarization pushes towards a helicoidal capillary shape, with
nonzero curvature and torsion.

thermodynamic states lying close to the liquid binodal, where the chemical
potential deviation $\delta \mu\equiv \mu - \mu_{co}(T)$ is very small and
positive, complete wetting by gas (drying) occurs and two regimes of
interfacial behavior can be identified. These are characterized by the length
scale $R_c=2 \gamma_{gl}^\infty/(\Delta \rho \delta \mu)$, where
$\gamma_{gl}^\infty$ is the planar gas-liquid surface tension and $\Delta \rho$
is the difference in coexisting densities at temperature $T$. For $R>R_c$, the
interfacial free energy and the density profile of the fluid near the hard wall
can be expanded in powers of the curvature $R^{-1}$, in keeping with the
analysis of Stillinger and Cotter, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 55}, 3449 (1971). In the
other regime, $R<R_c$, the interfacial free energy and its derivatives acquire
terms depending on $\ln R$. Since $R_c^{-1}$ can be made arbitrarily small this
implies non-analytic behavior, as $R^{-1}\to 0$, of the work of formation of a
hard spherical cavity and of the Gibbs adsorption and the fluid density at
contact with the wall. Our analysis, which is based on an effective interfacial
Hamiltonian combined with exact statistical mechanical sum rules, is confirmed

to study the possible evolution of the cosmological parameters from the point
of view of quantum field theory in curved space-time. In this work we continue
our previous investigations of the RG method based on potential low-energy
effects induced from physics at very high energy scales M_X near M_P. In the
present instance we assume that both the Newton constant, G, and the
cosmological term, \Lambda, can be functions of a scale parameter \mu. It turns
out that G(\mu) evolves according to a logarithmic law which may lead to
asymptotic freedom of gravity, similar to the gauge coupling in QCD. At the
same time \Lambda(\mu) evolves quadratically with \mu. We study the consistency
and cosmological consequences of these laws when \mu=H. Furthermore, we propose
to extend this method to the astrophysical domain after identifying the local
RG scale at the galactic level. It turns out that Kepler's third law of
celestial mechanics receives quantum corrections that may help to explain the
flat rotation curves of the galaxies without introducing the dark matter
hypothesis. The origin of these effects (cosmological and astrophysical) could
be linked, in our framework, to physics at M_X= 10^{16-17} GeV.

global flavor symmetry generates well-definite mass textures that correctly
reproduce the mass hierarchies and mixings of quarks and leptons. The model is
more constrained than usual little- Higgs models because of bounds on weak and

properly taken into account. In particular, the current lower limits on
sparticle and Higgs masses that can be derived within mSUGRA do not change
appreciably when the DM relic density constraint is imposed. I also show that

distribution of r balls in n cells, with each ball assigned independently to a
given cell with probability 1/n. Although closed form expressions can be given
for the distribution of various interesting quantities (such as the fraction of
cells that contain a given number of balls), these expressions are often of
limited practical use. Approximations provide an attractive alternative, and in
the present paper we consider a large deviation approximation as r and n tend
to infinity. In order to analyze the problem we first consider a dynamical
model, where the balls are placed in the cells sequentially and ``time''
corresponds to the number of balls that have already been thrown. A complete
large deviation analysis of this ``process level'' problem is carried out, and
the rate function for the original problem is then obtained via the contraction
principle. The variational problem that characterizes this rate function is
analyzed, and a fairly complete and explicit solution is obtained. The
minimizing trajectories and minimal cost are identified up to two constants,
and the constants are characterized as the unique solution to an elementary
fixed point problem. These results are then used to solve a number of
interesting problems, including an overflow problem and the partial coupon
collector's problem.

to deal with several technical difficulties due to the non-compactness of the

Our approach, which involves the study of layer potentials depending on a
parameter on compact manifolds as an intermediate step, yields the
invertibility of the relevant boundary integral operators in the global,
non-compact setting, which is rather unexpected. As an application, we prove
the well-posedness of the non-homogeneous Dirichlet problem on manifolds with
boundary and cylindrical ends. We also prove the existence of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, which we show to be a pseudodifferential operator in
the calculus of pseudodifferential operators that are ``almost translation

  results","21 pages",,,,"math.KT math.OA",,"  We survey some of the known results on the relation between the homology of
the {\em full} Hecke algebra of a reductive $p$-adic group $G$, and the
representation theory of $G$. Let us denote by $\CIc(G)$ the full Hecke algebra
of $G$ and by $\Hp_*(\CIc(G))$ its periodic cyclic homology groups. Let $\hat
G$ denote the admissible dual of $G$. One of the main points of this paper is
that the groups $\Hp_*(\CIc(G))$ are, on the one hand, directly related to the
topology of $\hat G$ and, on the other hand, the groups $\Hp_*(\CIc(G))$ are
explicitly computable in terms of $G$ (essentially, in terms of the conjugacy
classes of $G$ and the cohomology of their stabilizers). The relation between
$\Hp_*(\CIc(G))$ and the topology of $\hat G$ is established as part of a more
general principle relating $\Hp_*(A)$ to the topology of $\Prim(A)$, the
primitive ideal spectrum of $A$, for any finite typee algebra $A$. We provide
several new examples illustrating in detail this principle. We also prove in
this paper a few new results, mostly in order to better explain and tie
together the results that are presented here. For example, we compute the
Hochschild homology of $\maO(X) \rtimes \Gamma$, the crossed product of the
ring of regular functions on a smooth, complex algebraic variety $X$ by a
finite group $\Gamma$. We also outline a very tentative program to use these
results to construct and classify the cuspidal representations of $G$. At the
end of the paper, we also recall the definitions of Hochschild and cyclic
homology.

graph has no separating edge or vertex we show that the Artin group is not
abstractly commensurable to any other CLTTF Artin group. If, moreover, the
defining graph satisfies a further `vertex rigidity' condition, then the
abstract commensurator group of the Artin group is isomorphic to its
automorphism group and generated by inner automorphisms, graph automorphisms
(induced from automorphisms of the defining graph), and the involution which
maps each standard generator to its inverse. We observe that the techniques
used here to study automorphisms carry over easily to the Coxeter group
situation. We thus obtain a classification of the CLTTF type Coxeter groups up

given for the Artin groups.

also find that $\sqrt{3/5}a$ systematically deviates from the empirically

less than about 50, while it almost completely agrees with the deduced values

charged and suspended in a low pressure discharge background is a good
candidate to study the generic spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors at the
kinetic level through direct optical video-microscopy, because of the sub-mm
interparticle spacing and the slow time scale. In this paper, starting from the
basic picture of the avalanche type stick-slip cooperative hopping process
under the interplay of mutual coupling and the stochastic thermal agitation, we
briefly review our recent study on particle micro-motion and the associated

slow shear drive are also discussed.

dynamic system described by the Dirac equation. For investigation of S_D and
construction of S_{Dcl} one uses a new dynamic method: dynamic disquantization.
This relativistic purely dynamic procedure does not use principles of quantum
mechanics. The obtained classical analog S_{Dcl} is described by a system of
ordinary differential equations, containing the quantum constant $\hbar$ as a
parameter. Dynamic equations for S_{Dcl} are determined by the Dirac equation
uniquely. The dynamic system S_{Dcl} has ten degrees of freedom and cannot be a
pointlike particle, because it has an internal structure. There are two ways of
interpretation of the dynamic system S_{Dcl}: (1) dynamical interpretation and
(2) geometrical interpretation. In the dynamical interpretation the classical
Dirac particle S_{Dcl} is a two-particle structure (special case of a
relativistic rotator). It explains freely such properties of S_D as spin and
magnetic moment, which are strange for pointlike structure. In the geometrical
interpretation the world tube of S_{Dcl} is a ''two-dimensional broken band'',
consisting of similar segments. These segments are parallelograms (or
triangles), but not the straight line segments as in the case of a
structureless particle. Geometrical interpretation of the classical Dirac
particle S_{Dcl} generates a new approach to the elementary particle theory.

tolerances and tradeoffs (HOT) for functional requirements of flexibility,

a highly structured modularity that is self-dissimilar and scale-rich, with
extremes in low and high variability, including power laws, in both metabolite

the well-understood stoichiometry of metabolic networks in bacteria, and a

concatenated coding using the 7-qubit CSS code in the local and `nonlocal'

estimate. Second, the threshold, beyond the 1/r dependence, does not depend too
strongly on the noise levels for transporting qubits. Beyond these results, we
find that it is important to look at more than one level of concatenation in
order to estimate the threshold and that it may be beneficial in certain
places, like in the transportation of qubits, to do error correction only
infrequently.

continuous variable tangle ({\em contangle}), with the purpose of quantifying
the distributed (shared) entanglement in multimode, multipartite Gaussian
states. This is achieved by a proper convex roof extension of the squared
logarithmic negativity. We prove that the contangle satisfies the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality in all three--mode Gaussian states,
and in all fully symmetric $N$--mode Gaussian states, for arbitrary $N$. For
three--mode pure states we prove that the residual entanglement is a genuine
tripartite entanglement monotone under Gaussian local operations and classical
communication. We show that pure, symmetric three--mode Gaussian states allow a
promiscuous entanglement sharing, having both maximum tripartite residual
entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between any pair of modes.
These states are thus simultaneous continuous-variable analogs of both the GHZ
and the $W$ states of three qubits: in continuous-variable systems monogamy
does not prevent promiscuity, and the inequivalence between different classes
of maximally entangled states, holding for systems of three or more qubits, is
removed.
