massive ONe white dwarf is involved. In doing so we follow the evolution of

strongest sources of gravitational waves to be observed by LISA. While the
formation of binary SBHs during galaxy mergers is almost inevitable,
coalescence requires that the separation between binary components first drop
by a few orders of magnitude, due presumably to interaction of the binary with
stars and gas in a galactic nucleus. This article reviews the observational
evidence for binary SBHs and discusses how they would evolve. No completely
convincing case of a bound, binary SBH has yet been found, although a handful
of systems (e.g. interacting galaxies; remnants of galaxy mergers) are now
believed to contain two SBHs at projected separations of roughly one kpc.
N-body studies of binary evolution in gas-free galaxies have reached large
enough particle numbers to reproduce the slow, ""diffusive"" refilling of the
binary's loss cone that is believed to characterize binary evolution in real
galactic nuclei. While some of the results of these simulations -- e.g. the
binary hardening rate and eccentricity evolution -- are strongly $N$-dependent,
others -- e.g. the ""damage"" inflicted by the binary on the nucleus -- are not.
Luminous early-type galaxies often exhibit depleted cores with masses of 1-2
times the mass of their nuclear SBHs, consistent with the predictions of the
binary model. Studies of the interaction of massive binaries with gas are still
in their infancy, although much progress is expected in the near future. Binary
coalescence has a large influence on the spins of SBHs, even for mass ratios as
extreme as 10:1, and evidence of spin-flips may have been observed.

shown that modelling the experimental time series by means of the stochastic

example, the use of SDE permits to make the analysis of a continuous signal

study the effect of a piecewise polytropic EOS on the formation of stellar
clusters in turbulent, self-gravitating molecular clouds. We increase the
polytropic exponent gamma from 0.7 to 1.1 at some chosen density n_c, which we
vary from from 4.3x10^4 cm^-3 to 4.3x10^7 cm^-3. The change of thermodynamic
state at n_c selects a characteristic mass scale for fragmentation M_ch, which

lead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper we study the
limitations arising out of the finite size of simulation volume. This finite
size implies that modes larger than the size of the simulation volume are
ignored and a truncated power spectrum is simulated. If the simulation volume
is large enough then the mass in collapsed haloes expected from the full power
spectrum and from the truncated power spectrum should match. We propose a
quantitative measure based on this approach that allows us to compute the
minimum box size for an N-Body simulation. We find that the required box size
for simulations of LCDM model at high redshifts is much larger than is
typically used. We can also use this approach to quantify the effect of
perturbations at large scales for power law models and we find that if we fix
the scale of non-linearity, the required box size becomes very large as the
index becomes small. The appropriate box size computed using this approach is
also an appropriate choice for the transition scale when tools like MAP (Tormen
and Bertschinger, 1996) that add the contribution of the missing power are
used.

a range of sigma_* similar to that of Seyfert 1 galaxies, and a lower M_BH.
Until now the [O III] width has been used in place of the stellar velocity
dispersion, but some indications begin to arise against the effectiveness of
the gaseous kinematics in representing the bulge potential at least in NLS1s.
Bian & Zhao (2004) stressed the urgency to produce true sigma_* measurements.
Here we present new stellar velocity dispersions obtained through direct
measurements of the Ca II absorption triplet (~ 8550 A) in the nuclei of 8 NLS1

confirm our suspects (see Botte et al. 2004) that [O III] typically
overestimates the stellar velocity dispersion and demonstrate that NLS1s follow
the M_BH-sigma_* relation as Seyfert 1, quasars and non-active galaxies.

interpolates between the limits of a square-lattice ($J_1=0$), a
triangular-lattice ($J_2=J_1$), and decoupled linear chains ($J_2=0$). In all
cases, the susceptibility which has a Curie-Weiss behavior at high
temperatures, rolls over and begins to decrease below a peak temperature,
$T_p$. Scaling the exchange constants to get the same peak temperature, shows
that the susceptibilities for the square-lattice and linear chain limits have
similar magnitudes near the peak. Maximum deviation arises near the
triangular-lattice limit, where frustration leads to much smaller
susceptibility and with a flatter temperature dependence. We compare our
results to the inorganic materials Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ and Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$ and to a

different shaped solutions including twin peaks. We show that a ""singlet pair""

also analyze collisional effects between solitons in the same or different spin

the on-site and inter-site molecular fields coming from different Coulomb

growing magnetic moment coming from the dependence of the hopping integrals on
occupation of the neighboring sites involved in hopping. This effect is
described by the hopping interaction, $\Delta t$, and by what we call the
exchange-hopping interaction, $t_{ex}$. The exchange-hopping interaction, which
is the difference in hopping integrals for different occupation of neighboring
lattice sites, acts in analogous way to the Hund's magnetic exchange
interaction. The results are calculated for semi-elliptic density of states

concerning the variational principle of general relativity theory, which
apparently bothered Einstein and Hilbert, is shown and cleared up. Some
historical confusion seems caused by the impossibility to use the conventional
Euler-Lagrange formalism directly there, which even otherwise is nothing but
one of various possible procedures to apply the superior principle of least
action. Correspondingly to the absence of any direct calculation in the
literature so far, only a numerical modification in parts - explicitly taken
into account now after once mentioned by Hilbert without implementation - would
allow to compute the fundamental Einstein tensor density from these authors'
initial formulae, which must not be taken literally. Nevertheless adhering to a
merely symbolic Euler-Lagrange formalism, this needs a clear distinction
between 'component differentiation' and 'tensor differentiation' defined here.
Various corresponding solutions are shown including the probably most natural
one. Two of them are additionally verified in the detailed supplementary
material appended to the electronic edition of the note.

which can be obtained starting from the linear Fiertz-Pauli Lagrangian. It is
the aim of the present paper to study whether, under certain requirements, a
different and consistent theory can be found. These requirements will be the
common ones encountered in flat field theory: removal of the non physical
degrees of freedom and conservation of the energy momentum currents determined
by Noether's Theorem. It will be shown that imposing certain constraint
(related to the elimination of the undesired components of the reducible
representation) on the field manifold, a consistent theory (at least to first
order in nonlinearties) is achieved. The theory obtained proceeding this way is
characterizd, to the lowest nonlinear order, by certain parameter epsilon.
General Relativity's corresponding term is found to be a limit case when the
parameter tends to zero. So, epsilon measures at this level the size of the
breaking of the global symmetry appearing in General Relativity i.e.
diff.invariance. It remains as open questions the matters of the theory's
solvability to all orders and the appearence of it's quantized version.

We show that a global symmetry, remnant of the internal rotation group after

we consider the classes of orbifold compactifications T^d/Z_N (d even, N>2) and

sea s-s bar pairs may play a special role in the low-energy dynamics of QCD by
inducing significantly different patterns of chiral symmetry breaking in the
chiral limits N_f=2 (m_u=m_d=0, m_s physical) and N_f=3 (m_u=m_d=m_s=0). This
effect of vacuum fluctuations of s-s bar pairs is related to the violation of
the Zweig rule in the scalar sector, described through the two O(p^4)
low-energy constants L_4 and L_6 of the three-flavour strong chiral lagrangian.
In the case of significant vacuum fluctuations, three-flavour chiral expansions
might exhibit a numerical competition between leading- and
next-to-leading-order terms according to the chiral counting, and chiral
extrapolations should be handled with a special care. We investigate the impact
of the fluctuations of s-s bar pairs on chiral extrapolations in the case of
lattice simulations with three dynamical flavours in the isospin limit.
Information on the size of the vacuum fluctuations can be obtained from the
dependence of the masses and decay constants of pions and kaons on the light
quark masses. Even in the case of large fluctuations, corrections due to the
finite size of spatial dimensions can be kept under control for large enough
boxes (L around 2.5 fm).

under certain extreme circumstances is provided by two effects. The first is
simply the exponential enhancement of the rate at which a macrostate with large
entropy is emitted in any thermal process. The second is a new sense in which
the entropy of an ``object'' depends on the observer making the measurement, so
that observers crossing the horizon measure a different entropy flux across the
horizon than do observers remaining outside. In addition to the review, some
recent criticisms are addressed. In particular, additional arguments and
detailed numerical calculations showing the observer dependence of entropy are
presented in a simple model. This observer-dependence may have further
interesting implications for the thermodynamics of black holes.

observed since hardly a decade ago, are an exciting paradigm of a nonlinear
chain. In laboratory discharge experiments, these quasi-lattices are formed
spontaneously in the sheath region near a negative electrode, usually at a
levitated horizontal equilibrium configuration where gravity is balanced by an
electric field. It is long known (and experimentally confirmed) that
dust-lattices support linear oscillations, in the longitudinal (acoustic mode)
as well as in the transverse, in plane (acoustic-) or off-plane (optic-like
mode) directions. Either due to the (typically Yukawa type) electrostatic
inter-grain interaction forces or to the (intrinsically nonlinear) sheath
environment, nonlinearity is expected to play an important role in the dynamics
of these lattices. Furthermore, the coupling between the different modes may
induce coupled nonlinear modes. Despite this evidence, the elucidation of the
nonlinear mechanisms governing dust crystals is in a rather preliminary stage.
In this study, we derive a set of (coupled) discrete equations of motion for
longitudinal and transverse (out-of-plane) motion in a one dimensional model
chain of charged dust grains. In a continuum approximation, i.e. assuming a
variation scale which is larger than the lattice constant, one obtains a set of
coupled modified Boussinesq-like equations. Different nonlinear solutions of

and on coupled equations for the envelopes of co-propagating quasi-linear

not organized so the conformation is essentially linear. Reconstruction of free

because of their complex interactions, the understanding of their collective
behaviour requires mathematical modelling. Intriguingly, it has been observed
in numerous developmental contexts, and particularly hematopoiesis, that genes
regulating differentiation are initially co-expressed in progenitors despite
their antagonism, before one is upregulated and others downregulated. We
characterise conditions under which 3 classes of generic ""master regulatory
networks"", modelled at the molecular level after experimentally-observed
interactions (including bHLH protein dimerisation), and including an arbitrary
number of antagonistic components, can behave as a ""multi-switch"", directing
differentiation in an all-or-none fashion to a specific cell-type chosen among
more than 2 possible outcomes. bHLH dimerisation networks can readily display
coexistence of many antagonistic factors when competition is low (a simple
characterisation is derived). Decision-making can be forced by a transient
increase in competition, which could correspond to some unexplained
experimental observations related to Id proteins; the speed of response varies
with the initial conditions the network is subjected to, which could explain
some aspects of cell behaviour upon reprogramming. The coexistence of
antagonistic factors at low levels, early in the differentiation process or in
pluripotent stem cells, could be an intrinsic property of the interaction
between those factors, not requiring a specific regulatory system.

  my webpage",,,,"quant-ph nlin.CD",,"  The Loschmidt echo (LE) is a measure of the sensitivity of quantum mechanics
to perturbations in the evolution operator. It is defined as the overlap of two
wave functions evolved from the same initial state but with slightly different
Hamiltonians. Thus, it also serves as a quantification of irreversibility in
quantum mechanics.
  In this thesis the LE is studied in systems that have a classical counterpart
with dynamical instability, that is, classically chaotic. An analytical
treatment that makes use of the semiclassical approximation is presented. It is
shown that, under certain regime of the parameters, the LE decays
exponentially. Furthermore, for strong enough perturbations, the decay rate is
given by the Lyapunov exponent of the classical system. Some particularly
interesting examples are given.
  The analytical results are supported by thorough numerical studies. In
addition, some regimes not accessible to the theory are explored, showing that
the LE and its Lyapunov regime present the same form of universality ascribed
to classical chaos. In a sense, this is evidence that the LE is a robust
temporal signature of chaos in the quantum realm.
  Finally, the relation between the LE and the quantum to classical transition
is explored, in particular with the theory of decoherence. Using two different
approaches, a semiclassical approximation to Wigner functions and a master
equation for the LE, it is shown that the decoherence rate and the decay rate
of the LE are equal. The relationship between these quantities results mutually
beneficial, in terms of the broader resources of decoherence theory and of the
possible experimental realization of the LE.
