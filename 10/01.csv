these stars should have drastically reduced equatorial winds (mass loss) while
on the main sequence, and as such should retain most of their angular momentum.
Observations of both the Be/(B+Be) ratio and the blue-to-red supergiant ratio
appear to have a metallicity dependence that may be caused by high rotational
velocities. We have analyzed 39 archival Hubble Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS), high resolution, ultraviolet spectra of O-type stars in
the Magellanic Clouds to determine their projected rotational velocities V sin
i. Our methodology is based on a previous study of the projected rotational
velocities of Galactic O-type stars using International Ultraviolet Explorer
(IUE) Short Wavelength Prime (SWP) Camera high dispersion spectra, which
resulted in a catalog of V sin i values for 177 O stars. Here we present
complementary V sin i values for 21 Large Magellanic Cloud and 22 Small
Magellanic Cloud O-type stars based on STIS and IUE UV spectroscopy. The
distribution of V sin i values for O type stars in the Magellanic Clouds is
compared to that of Galactic O type stars. Despite the theoretical predictions
and indirect observational evidence for high rotation, the O type stars in the
Magellanic Clouds do not appear to rotate faster than their Galactic
counterparts.

photometric approaches and a reasonable range for the time delay in the system

ratios depending on the wavelength. These new measurements are consistent with
differential extinction in the lens galaxy, the Lyman limit system, the damped
Ly-alpha system, or the host galaxy of the QSO. The possible values for the
differential extinction and the ratio of total to selective extinction in the V
band are reasonable. Moreover, crude probability arguments suggest that the ray
paths of the two components cross a similar dusty environment, including a
network of compact dust clouds and compact dust voids. As an alternative (in
fact, the usual interpretation of the old ratios), we also try to explain the
new ratios as caused by gravitational microlensing in the deflector. From
magnification maps for each of the gravitationally lensed images, using
different fractions of the surface mass density represented by the microlenses,
as well as different sizes and profiles of the V-band and R-band sources,
several synthetic distributions of V-band and R-band ratios are derived. In
some gravitational scenarios, there is an apparent disagreement between the

microlensing pictures work well. To decide between either extinction, or
microlensing, or a mixed scenario (extinction + microlensing), new

After a mass of 0.1 solar mass accumulates in the central cell (forming star),
a series of magnetically driven outflows and associated outward propagating
shocks form in a quasi-periodic fashion. As a result, mass accretion onto the
protostar occurs in magnetically controlled bursts. We refer to this process as
spasmodic accretion. The shocks propagate outward with supermagnetosonic
speeds. The period of dissipation and revival of the outflow decreases in time,
as the mass accumulated in the central sink increases. We evaluate the
contribution of ambipolar diffusion to the resolution of the magnetic flux
problem of star formation during the accretion phase, and we find it to be very
significant although not sufficient to resolve the entire problem yet. Ohmic
dissipation is completely negligible in the disk during this phase of the
evolution. The protostellar disk is found to be stable against interchange-like
instabilities, despite the fact that the mass-to-flux ratio has temporary local
maxima.

recent observations of giant pulses with the Effelsberg telescope at a center

Moreover, there is an evidence for spectral evolution within and between those

model in which multiple interactions have occurred, with the latest strong
encounter involving at least two major components within the last 200 Myr.
Debris from the encounter fuels ongoing star formation at the global level of
$\sim20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, with self-gravity within the tidal tail
possibly providing a mechanism to enhance the star formation rate of the tidal
dwarf candidates, with bursts of star-formation in clumps of mass $\sim2\times

spatial resolution than ASCA, confirmed that G32.45+0.1 has a diffuse
shell-like structure with a radius of ~4'. The spectrum shows featureless
continuum, hence can be fitted with a power-law model of Gamma ~2.2 with an
absorption of N_H~5.2*10^{22}cm^{-2}. From this N_H value, we estimate the
distance to G32.45+0.1 to be ~17kpc, then the luminosity (in the 0.5-10.0keV

The radio complex sources in the NRAO/VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4GHz) are
globally associated to the X-ray shell of G32.45+0.1. Therefore G32.45+0.1 is
likely to be a synchrotron dominant shell-like SNR. No significant diffuse

during the `null' phases, which should therefore be considered to be a
different mode rather than a null. During this weak mode the profile is similar
to that observed in the strong mode at low radio frequency. Using a
phase-tracking method, the pattern of drifting subpulses during the strong mode
is seen to be coherent across the whole profile. The drift rate is variable and
includes positive and negative values. Thirteen subpulse bands have been
directly observed, covering the whole longitude range. The subpulses and their
spacings ($P_2$) are wider in one half of the profile than those in the other
half. This difference, and the variation of observed $P_2$ within the two

code which computes mass transfer implicitly and models irradiation of the
donor star in a point source approximation, thereby allowing for more realistic
simulations than were hitherto possible. We find that low-mass X-ray binaries
and cataclysmic variables with orbital periods less than about 6 hours can
undergo mass transfer cycles only for low angular momentum loss rates. CVs
containing a giant donor or one near the terminal age main sequence are more
stable than previously thought, but can possibly also undergo mass transfer
cycles.

very complex and single stars only perhaps can do the job. (Un)Fortunately at

evolution. Therefore galactic studies that do not account for close binary

interpret this result as evidence in favour of Comptonisation models where the
observed X-rays are produced through Compton up-scattering of thermal UV seed
photons from an accretion disc, as this process naturally predicts the UV
variations to precede similar flux variations in the X-rays. The length of the
time lag favours models where the observed UV and the seed-photon-emitting
regions are connected by perturbations of the accretion flow traveling inwards
through the disc, affecting first the main U-band-emitting radii and then the
innermost region where the bulk of the seed photons is expected to be produced.
Finally, the absence of significant features in the correlation function with
X-ray flux variations preceding those in the UV indicates that the observed
U-band photons are not mainly produced through reprocessing of hard X-rays in
this source.

cannot exceed a few km/s in the Pleiades cluster. In order to discern more

through an adiabatic quantum electron pump. The pumping is through a system of
barriers, whose heights are deformed adiabatically. (Weak) interaction effects
are introduced through a renormalisation group flow of the scattering matrices
and the pumped charge is shown to {\it always} approach a quantised value at
low temperatures or long length scales. The maximum value of the pumped charge
is set by the number of barriers and is given by $Q_{\rm max} = n_b -1$. The
correlation between the transmission and the charge pumped is studied by seeing
how much of the transmission is enclosed by the pumping contour. The (integer)
value of the pumped charge at low temperatures is determined by the number of
transmission maxima enclosed by the pumping contour. The dissipation at finite
temperatures leading to the non-quantised values of the pumped charge scales as
a power law with the temperature ($Q-Q_{\rm int} \propto T^{2\alpha}$), or with
the system size ($Q-Q_{\rm int} \propto L_s^{-2\alpha}$), where $\alpha$ is a
measure of the interactions and vanishes at $T=0 ~(L_s=\infty)$. For a double
barrier system, our result agrees with the quantisation of pumped charge seen
in Luttinger liquids.

  couple of new references",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Given a particular prescription for the Einstein field equations (EFE's), it
is important to have general protective theorems that lend support to it. The
prescription of data on a timelike hypersurface for the (n + 1)-d EFE's arises
in `noncompact Kaluza--Klein theory', and in certain kinds of braneworlds and
low-energy string theory. The Campbell--Magaard (CM) theorem, which asserts
local existence (and, with extra conditions, uniqueness) of analytic embeddings
of completely general n-d manifolds into vacuum (n + 1)-d manifolds, has often
recently been invoked as a protective theorem for such prescriptions. But in
this paper I argue that there are problems with loosening the CM thoerem of
restrictive meanings in its statement, which is worthwhile thing to do in
pursuit of the proposed applications. While I remedy some problems by
identifying the required topology, delineating what `local' can be taken to
mean, and offering a new, more robust and covariant proof, other problems
remain unsurmountable. The theorem lends only inadequate support, both because
it offers no guarantee of continuous dependence on the data and because it
disregards causality. Furthermore, the theorem is only for the analytic
functions which renders it inappropriate for the study of the relativistic
equations of modern physics. Unfortunately, there are no known general theorems
that offer adequate protection to the proposed applications' prescription. I
conclude by making some suggestions for more modest progress.

structure function G(\xi)=(1-\xi^2)(1+r_{+}A\xi)(1+r_{-}A\xi), where r_\pm are
the usual locations of the horizons in the Kerr-Newman black hole. Unlike the
non-rotating case, this new form is not related to the traditional one by a
coordinate transformation. We show that the physical distinction between these
two forms of the rotating C-metric lies in the nature of the conical
singularities causing the black holes to accelerate apart: the new form is free
of torsion singularities and therefore does not contain any closed timelike
curves. We claim that this new form should be considered the natural

that increases monotonically along the flow, based on Perelman's Ricci flow
entropy. One consequence is the absence of periodic solutions, and we are able
to give a second, direct proof of this. If the scalar curvature is everywhere
positive, we instead construct a regularized volume to provide an entropy for
the flow. Our results are, in a sense, the analogue of Zamolodchikov's

The stack reflectivity at this point can be very low, implying nearly total
conversion of the incident light into the frozen mode with huge energy density,
compared to that of the incident light. Supposedly, the frozen mode regime
requires strong birefringence in the anisotropic layers - by an order of
magnitude stronger than that available in common anisotropic dielectric

exploiting higher frequency bands of the photonic spectrum. We prove that a

energetics, structure, growth, and stability of also larger clusters has been
carried through without more or less severe assumptions on the initial
geometries in the structure optimization, on the symmetry, or on bond lengths.
It is shown that cluster growth is predominantly icosahedral with $islands$ of
{\it fcc}, {\it tetrahedral} and {\it decahedral} growth. For the first time in
unbiased computations it is found that Ni$_{147}$ is the multilayer (third
Mackay) icosahedron. Further, we point to an enhanced ability of {\it fcc}
clusters to compete with the icosahedral and decahedral structures in the

hcp}/anti-Mackay kind of icosahedral growth to the {\it fcc}/Mackay one occurs
within a transition layer including several cluster sizes. Moreover, we present
and apply different analytical tools in studying structural and energetic
properties of such a large class of clusters. These include means for
identifying the overall shape, the occurrence of atomic shells, the similarity
of the clusters with, e.g., fragments of the {\it fcc} crystal or of a large
icosahedral cluster, and a way of analysing whether the $N$-atom cluster can be
considered constructed from the $(N-1)$-atom one by adding an extra atom. In
addition, we compare in detail with results from chemical-probe experiment.

quantum error correcting codes (QECCs). The simplification of the
encoder-decoder circuit for a perfect five-qubit QECC can be derived
analytically if the QECC is converted from its equivalent one-way entanglement
purification protocol (1-EPP). In this work, the analytical method to simplify
the encoder-decoder circuit is introduced and a circuit that is as simple as
the existent simplest circuits is presented as an example. The encoder-decoder
circuit presented here involves nine single- and two-qubit unitary operations,
only six of which are controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates.

photon scheme, or entanglement which is not applicable to the current
infrastructure of optical communication network. We are concerned with the
following question: Can we realize the information theoretically secure
symmetric key cipher under ""the finite secret key"" based on quantum-optical
communications? A role of quantum information theory is to give an answer for
such a question. As an answer for the question, a new quantum cryptography was
proposed by H.P.Yuen, which can realize a secure symmetric key cipher with high
speeds(Gbps) and for long distance(1000 Km). Although some researchers claim
that Yuen protocol(Y-00) is equivalent to the classical cryptography, they are
all mistaken. Indeed it has no classical analogue, and also provides a
generalization even in the conventional cryptography.
  At present, it is proved that a basic model of Y-00 has at least the security
such as $H(X|Y_E)=H(K|Y_E)=H(K)$, $H(K|Y_E,X)\sim 0$ under the average photon
number per signal light pulse:$<n> \sim 10000$. Towards our final goal, in this
paper, we clarify a role of classical randomness(secret key) and quantum
randomness in Y-00, and give a rigorous quantum mechanical interpretation of
the security, showing an analysis of quantum collective attack.

The obtained results clearly show that the main reason for the EIA sub-natural

the ground one. In the EIA case we predict the negative structures in the
absortpion resonance at large field detuning. The role of the finite atom-light

pseudo-Hermitian operators to PT-symmetric systems defined on a complex
contour. We apply this method to study the Hamiltonians $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\nu$
with $\nu\in(-2,\infty)$ that are defined along the corresponding anti-Stokes
lines. In particular, we reveal the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of $H$ for the
cases that $\nu$ is an even integer, so that $H=p^2\pm x^{2+\nu}$, and give a
proof of the discreteness of the spectrum of $H$ for all $\nu\in(-2,\infty)$.
Furthermore, we study the consequences of defining a square-well Hamiltonian on
a wedge-shaped complex contour. This yields a PT-symmetric system with a finite
number of real eigenvalues. We present a comprehensive analysis of this system
within the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. We also outline a
direct pseudo-Hermitian treatment of PT-symmetric systems defined on a complex
contour which clarifies the underlying mathematical structure of the
formulation of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics based on the charge-conjugation
operator. Our results provide a conclusive evidence that pseudo-Hermitian
quantum mechanics provides a complete description of general PT-symmetric
systems regardless of whether they are defined along the real line or a complex
contour.

of spontaneous and stimulated transitions in a degenerate V-type three-level
atom with an arbitrary total momentum of each state. Explicit expressions for
the factors in the terms of the relaxation operator and stimulated transition
operator with account of quantum interference effects are obtained. It has been
demonstrated that the condition for the dipole transition moments to be
parallel is insufficient and for conventional atoms the interference cross
terms are zeros for both operators. The conditions when quantum interference
influences the properties of the relaxation operators have been analysed. For
the stimulated transitions this condition is shown to be anisotropy of the
photon field interacting with the atoms. This case is minutely studied for the
