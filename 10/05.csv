all these optical afterglows are bright enough to be detected by the

the possibility of Planck-scale departures from Lorentz symmetry, including

that a meaningful characterization of the progress of experimental bounds on

theories, and I propose to focus on two ``minimal'' test theories, a
pure-kinematics test theory and an effective-field-theory-based test theory. I
illustrate some features of the phenomenology based on these test theories
considering some popular strategies for constraining Planck-scale effects, and
in particular I observe that sensitivities that are already in the Planck-scale
range for some parameters of the two test theories can be achieved using
observations of TeV photons from Blazars, both using the so-called ``gamma-ray
time-of-flight analyses'' and using the now robust evidence of absorption of
TeV photons. Instead the Crab-nebula synchrotron-radiation analyses, whose
preliminary sensitivity estimates raised high hopes, actually do not lead to
any bound on the parameters of the two ``minimal'' test theories. The
Crab-nebula synchrotron-radiation analyses do however constrain some possible
generalizations of one of the minimal test theories. As an example of
forthcoming data which could provide extremely stringent (beyond-Planckian)
limits on the two minimal test theories I consider the possibility of studies
of the GZK cutoff for cosmic-rays.

estimating stellar masses of galaxies. We compare the results of (a) fitting
stellar population synthesis models to broad band colors from SDSS and 2MASS,
(b) the analysis of spectroscopic features of SDSS galaxies (Kauffmann et al.
2003), and, (c) a simple dynamical mass estimate based on SDSS velocity
dispersions and effective radii. Knowing that all three methods can have
significant biases, a comparison can help to establish their (relative)
reliability. In this way, one can also probe the quality of the observationally
cheap broadband color mass estimators for galaxies at higher redshift.
Generally, masses based on broad-band colors and spectroscopic features agree
reasonably well, with a rms scatter of only ~ 0.25 dex over almost 4 decades in
mass. However, as may be expected, systematic differences do exist and have an
amplitude of ~ 0.15 dex, corrleting with Halpha emission strength.
Interestingly, masses from broad-band color fitting are in better agreement
with dynamical masses than masses based on the analysis of spectroscopic
features. In addition, the differences between the latter and the dynamical
masses correlate with Halpha equivalent width, while this much less the case
for the broad-band masses. We conclude that broad band color mass estimators,
provided they are based on a large enough wavelength coverage and use an
appropriate range of ages, metallicities and dust extinctions, can yield fairly
reliable stellar masses for galaxies. This is a very encouraging result as such
mass estimates are very likely the only ones available at significant redshifts
for some time to come.

function of the initial positions of cosmological dark matter halos. In this

of cosmological feedback, we are able to construct cross-correlation functions
of objects with varying masses and formation redshifts and compare them with a
variety of analytical approaches. For the case in which both formation
redshifts are equal, we find good agreement between our numerical results and
the bivariate model of Scannapieco & Barkana (2002; SB02) at all masses,
redshifts, and separations, while the model of Porciani et al. (1998) does well
for all parameters except for objects with different masses at small
separations. We find that the standard mapping between Lagrangian and Eulerian
bias performs well for rare objects at all separations, but fails if the
objects are highly-nonlinear (low-sigma) peaks. In the Lagrangian case in which
the formation redshifts differ, the SB02 model does well for all separations
and combinations of masses, apart from a discrepancy at small separations in
situations in which the smaller object is formed earlier and the difference
between redshifts or masses is large. As this same limitation arises in the
standard approach to the single-point progenitor distribution developed by
Lacey & Cole (1993), we conclude that a more complete understanding of the

dust grains in circumstellar disks have grown to millimeter size or larger.
However, gas drag on such large grains induces rapid accretion of the dust. We
examine the evolution of dust disks composed of millimeter sized grains, and
show that rapid accretion of the dust disk causes attenuation of millimeter
continuum emission. If a dust disk is composed mainly of grains of 1 cm to 1 m,
its millimeter emission goes off within 10^6 yr. Hence, grains in this size
range cannot be a main population of the dust. Considering our results together
with grain growth suggested by the millimeter continuum observations, we expect
that the millimeter continuum emission of disks comes mainly from grains in a
narrow size range of [1 mm -1 cm]. This suggests either that growth of
millimeter sized grains to centimeter size takes more than 10^6 yr, or that
millimeter sized grains are continuously replenished. In the former case,
planet formation is probably difficult, especially in the outer disks. In the
latter case, reservoirs of millimeter grains are possibly large (> 10 m)
bodies, which can reside in the disk more than 10^6 yr. Constraints on the

function methods) represent an efficient way to estimate power spectra of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and their polarization. We
construct the sample covariance properties of such estimators for CMB
polarization, and develop semi-analytic techniques to approximate the
pseudo-C_l sample covariance matrices at high Legendre multipoles, taking
account of the geometric effects of mode coupling and the mixing between the
electric (E) and magnetic (B) polarization that arise for observations covering
only part of the sky. The E-B mixing ultimately limits the applicability of
heuristically-weighted quadratic methods to searches for the gravitational-wave
signal in the large-angle B-mode polarization, even for methods that can
recover (exactly) unbiased estimates of the B-mode power. We show that for
surveys covering one or two per cent of the sky, the contribution of E-mode
power to the covariance of the recovered B-mode power spectrum typically limits
the tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be probed with such methods to around 0.05.

belong to the OriOB1b population in the Orion star-forming complex. In this

RIJHK is consistent with membership of the young population. The variability of
these objects was investigated using a densely sampled I-band time series
covering four consecutive nights with altogether 129 data points per object.
Our targets show three types of variability: Thirty objects, including nine
BDs, show significant photometric periods, ranging from 4h up to 100h, which we
interpret as the rotation periods. Five objects, including two BDs, exhibit
variability with high amplitudes up to 1 mag which is at least partly
irregular. This behaviour is most likely caused by ongoing accretion and
confirms that VLM objects undergo a T Tauri phase similar to solar-mass stars.
Finally, one VLM star shows a strong flare event of 0.3 mag amplitude. The
rotation periods show dependence on mass, i.e. the average period decreases
with decreasing object mass, consistent with previously found mass-period
relationships in younger and older clusters. The period distribution of BDs
extends down to the breakup period, where centrifugal and gravitational forces
are balanced. Combining our BD periods with literature data, we found that the
lower period limit for substellar objects lies between 2h and 4h, more or less
independent of age. Contrary to stars, these fast rotating BDs seem to evolve
at constant rotation period from ages of 3 Myr to 1 Gyr, in spite of the
contraction process. Thus, they should experience strong rotational braking.

companion stars. Out of these 74 candidate companions, 41 have not been
reported before (14 in US; 13 in UCL; 14 in LCC). Companion star masses range
from 0.1 to 3 Msun. The mass ratio distribution follows f(q) = q^-0.33, which
excludes random pairing. No close (rho < 3.75'') companion stars or background
stars are found in the magnitude range 12 < Ks < 14. The lack of stars with
these properties cannot be explained by low-number statistics, and may imply a
lower limit on the companion mass of ~ 0.1 Msun. Close stellar components with
Ks > 14 are observed. If these components are very low-mass companion stars, a
gap in the companion mass distribution might be present. The small number of
close low-mass companion stars could support the embryo-ejection formation
scenario for brown dwarfs. Our findings are compared with and complementary to
visual, spectroscopic, and astrometric data on binarity in Sco OB2. We find an
overall companion star fraction of 0.52 in this association. This paper is the

reach with the new generation of ground-based near-IR interferometers, like the
Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The high contrast between star and
planet requires an excellent calibration of atmospheric distortions. Proposed
techniques are the observation of color-differential or closure phases. The
differential phase, however, is only in a first order approximation independent
of atmospheric influences because of dispersion effects. This might prevent
differential phase observations of extrasolar planets. The closure phase, on
the other hand, is immune to atmospheric phase errors and is therefore a
promising alternative. We have modeled the response of the closure phase
instrument AMBER at the VLTI to realistic models of known extrasolar planetary
systems taking into account their theoretical spectra as well as the geometry
of the VLTI. We present a strategy to determine the geometry of the planetary
system and the spectrum of the extrasolar planet from closure phase
observations in a deterministic way without any a priori assumptions. We show
that the nulls in the closure phase do only depend on the system geometry but
not on the planetary or stellar spectra. Therefore, the geometry of the system
can be determined by measuring the nulls in the closure phase and braking the
remaining ambiguity due to the unknown system orientation by means of
observations at different hour angles. Based on the known geometry, the planet
spectrum can be directly synthesized from the closure phases.

coverage spectra of nuclear and off-nuclear continuum-emitting regions have
been used to estimate the ages, masses and luminosities of the YSP component,
taking full account of reddening effects and potential contamination by
activity-related components. We find that the YSP make a substantial
contribution to the continuum flux in the off-nuclear regions on a radial scale
of 1 - 20kpc in all three objects. Moreover, in two objects we find evidence
for reddened post-starburst stellar populations in the near-nuclear regions of
the host galaxies. The YSP are relatively old (0.1- 2Gyr), massive and make up
a large proportion (~1 - 50%) of the total stellar mass in the regions of
galaxies sampled by the observations. Overall, these results are consistent
with the idea that AGN activity in some radio galaxies is triggered by major
gas-rich mergers. Therefore, these radio galaxies form part of the subset of
early-type galaxies that is evolving most rapidly in the local universe.
Intriguingly, the results also suggest that the radio jets are triggered
relatively late in the merger sequence, and that there is an evolutionary link
between radio galaxies and luminous/ultra-luminous infrared galaxies.

This upper limit for U-V scatter is consistent with z_form>1.2 for the bulk of
the stars in red cluster galaxies, and a maximum age spread of 5.2 Gyr. We note
that none of the slopes exhibit a break as claimed by Metcalf et al., and using
colors from equal-light apertures does not remove the CMR slope. Our findings
expand the single Coma data point and provide a much-needed z=0 base-line for

CMR-relative color represents rough cluster infall times and find that blue

form of small dust grains, to the stage when most solids have condensed into
planetesimals. Then, based on the core accretion - gas capture scenario, we
estimate the planet-bearing capability of the environment defined by the final
planetesimal swarm and the still evolving gaseous component of the disk. We
define the probability of planet-formation, $P_p$, as the normalized fractional
area in the ($M_0$, $\log R_0$) plane populated by disks that have formed
planets inside 5 AU. With such a definition, and under the assumption that the
population of planets discovered at $R$ $<$ 5 AU is not significantly
contaminated by planets that have migrated from $R$ $>$ 5 AU, our results agree
fairly well with the observed dependence between the probability that a star
harbors a planet and the star's metal content. The agreement holds for the disk
viscosity parameter $\alpha$ ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$, and it
becomes much poorer when the redistribution of solids relative to the gas is

$M\sim 10^{11} h^{-1}\msun$, which cannot be probed directly by our groups, is
inferred from the conditional luminosity function (CLF) that matches the
observed galaxy luminosity function and clustering. For a halo of given mass,
the distribution of $L_c$ is rather narrow. The satellite galaxies are found to
follow a Poissonian number distribution. The central galaxies in low-mass
haloes are mostly late type galaxies, while those in massive haloes are almost
all early types. We also measure the CLF of galaxies in haloes of given mass.
Over the mass range that can be reliably probed with the present data ($13.3
\lta {\rm log}[M/(h^{-1}\Msun)] \lta 14.7$), the CLF is reasonably well fit by
a Schechter function. Contrary to recent claims based on semi-analytical models
of galaxy formation, the presence of central galaxies does not show up as a
strong peak at the bright end of the CLF. (Abridged)

difference between the model parameters, precisely their behavior as a function
of the energy, the strong no linearity of the model, we propose a method, which
permits to make the distinction between gamma ray primaries from hadronic
primaries. The possible backgrounds for ground based gamma ray astronomy are
studied and the efficiency of the method is calculated. Different detector
displacements are analyzed using the simulation of simplified mass spectrum of
cosmic ray. The detector response is simulated taking into account the physical
fluctuation of the processes, the statistical and possible systematic errors.
The simulated and reconstructed events are compared and the accuracy in energy

allows for topologically non-trivial static solutions of the equations of
motion, associated with the change of chirality (clockwise or counterclockwise)
of the spiral. We consider two types of these topological defects, single
vortices and vortex-antivortex pairs, and quantize the corresponding solutions
by generalizing the semiclassical approach to a non-Abelian field theory. The
use of the collective coordinates allows us to represent the defect as a
particle coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, which can be integrated out
employing the Feynman-Vernon path-integral formalism. The resulting effective
action for the defect indicates that its motion is damped due to the scattering
by the magnons. We derive a general expression for the damping coefficient of
the defect, and evaluate its temperature dependence in both cases, for a single
vortex and for a vortex-antivortex pair. Finally, we consider an application of
the model for cuprates, where a spiral state has been argued to be realized in
the spin-glass regime. By assuming that the defect motion contributes to the
dissipative dynamics of the charges, we can compare our results with the
measured inverse mobility in a wide range of temperature. The relatively good
agreement between our calculations and the experiments confirms the possible
relevance of an incommensurate spiral order for lightly doped cuprates.

the fundamental time constant for step fluctuations on Ag and Al/Si varies by
orders of magnitude over the temperature ranges of measurement, no dependence

scaling dependence which includes both the sampling interval and the total
measurement time tm. Scaling with t/Dt occurs only when Dt/tm is a constant. We
show that this observation is equivalent to theoretical predictions that the

measured with fixed values of tm or Dt should also show little or no

A discussion of an alternative potential to model screened excitons is given,

scattering phase shifts for this potential with those obtained using the
two-dimensional analogue of the Yukawa potential. The second problem relates to
excitons in a quantising magnetic field in the fractional quantum Hall regime.
An exciton against the background of an incompressible quantum liquid is

corresponding fits lie almost on top of each other over the whole range of the
reduced temperatures t (for bin averaged data) 6.3 x 10^{-10} < t < 8.8 x

this effect diminishes with increasing $n_O$.

directly provide canonical momenta for spatial components of all Cartan

  and Adler sum rules","6 pages. Talks delivered at ICHEP 04 Beijing, and at Quarks2004",,,"IPPP/04/61, DTP/04/122","hep-ph",,"  The Adler sum rule for deep inelastic neutrino scattering measures the
isospin of the nucleus, and is hence exact. In contrast the Gottfried sum rule
for charged lepton scattering does receive perturbative and non-perturbative
corrections. We show that at two-loop level the Gottfried sum rule is
suppressed by a factor 1/Nc^2 relative to higher moments, and we conjecture
that this suppression holds to all-orders, and also for higher-twist effects.
It is further noted that differences between radiative corrections for higher
moments of neutrino and charged lepton deep inelastic scattering, are 1/Nc^2
suppressed at two-loops, and this is also conjectured to hold to all-orders.
The 1/Nc^2 suppression of corrections to the Gottfried sum rule makes it
plausible that the deviations from the parton model value are dominated by a
light quark flavour asymmetry in the nucleon sea. This asymmetry indeed
persists as Nc-->infinity as predicted in a chiral soliton model.

derived with a moduli space approximation (MSA) and agrees with the
corresponding results derived elsewhere. Rather than stabilising the radion, we
look at cosmological evolution of the system stimulated by breaking the BPS
condition on the branes. We examine in detail the range of validity of the MSA
in both the RS and BPS case, paying particular attention to the divergences
that can arise during a collision of the branes. In the absence of
perturbations such an event is finite in the RS model, and accurately described

parameter (the mass gap) responsible for the large scale structure of the true
QCD vacuum. At the microscopic, Lagrangian level it is the nonlinear
fundamental four-gluon interaction. At the level of the corresponding equation
of motion for the full gluon propagator, it is all the skeleton loop
contributions into the gluon self-energy, which contain the four-gluon
vertices. The key role of the four-gluon interaction is determined by the fact
that this interaction survivies when all the gluon momenta involved go to zero,
while the three-gluon vertex vanishes in this limit. The mass gap and the
corresponding infrared singularities are ""hidden"" in these terms, and they show
up explicitly when the gluon momentum $q$ goes to zero. The general iteration
solution (i.e., when the relevant skeleton loop integrals have to be iterated)
for the full gluon propagator unavoidably becomes the exact sum of the two
terms. The first term is the Laurent expansion in the inverse powers of the
gluon momentum squared, starting necessarily from the simplest one $1/(q^2)^2$.
Each severe (i.e., more singular than $1/q^2$) power-type IR singularity is
accompanied by the corresponding powers of the mass gap. The standard second
term is always as much singular as $1/q^2$, otherwise remaining undetermined.
The inevitable existence of the first term makes just the principal difference
between non-Abelian QCD and Abelian QED. Moreover, the infrared renormalization
program of the theory leads to the gluon confinement criterion in the

multiple-comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey. It concerns a
situation where there are many independent tests of significance and one is
interested in rejecting the joint null hypothesis. Tukey suggested comparing
the fraction of observed significances at a given \alpha-level to the expected
fraction under the joint null. In fact, he suggested standardizing the
difference of the two quantities and forming a z-score; the resulting z-score
tests the significance of the body of significance tests. We consider a
generalization, where we maximize this z-score over a range of significance
levels 0<\alpha\leq\alpha_0.
  We are able to show that the resulting higher criticism statistic is
effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal
means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero. The
subtlety of this ``sparse normal means'' testing problem can be seen from work
of Ingster and Jin, who studied such problems in great detail. In their
studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction
of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little
noticeable effect on the distribution of the p-values either for the bulk of
the tests or for the few most highly significant tests.
  In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the
fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely specified
alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses.

stability in the presence of outliers of moderate size, do not possess a
substantially better breakdown behavior than estimation based on Normal
mixtures. If the number of clusters s is treated as fixed, r additional points
suffice for all three methods to let the parameters of r clusters explode. Only
in the case of r=s is this not possible for t-mixtures. The ability to estimate
the number of mixture components, for example, by use of the Bayesian
information criterion of Schwarz [Ann. Statist. 6 (1978)

for an improved breakdown behavior of all three techniques. Furthermore, a

to each providing that to the other. Although Tops\oe described this connection
for the Shannon entropy over 20 years ago, it does not appear to be widely

apply to arbitrary decision problems and loss functions. We indicate how an
appropriate generalized definition of entropy can be associated with such a

above-mentioned duality continues to apply in this extended context.

a tool for finding robust Bayes acts. We also describe the essential identity
between the problem of maximizing entropy and that of minimizing a related
discrepancy or divergence between distributions. This leads to an extension, to
arbitrary discrepancies, of a well-known minimax theorem for the case of
Kullback-Leibler divergence (the ``redundancy-capacity theorem'' of information
theory). For the important case of families of distributions having certain
mean values specified, we develop simple sufficient conditions and methods for

study the problem of obtaining verifiable regularity conditions that suffice to
yield uniform consistency and uniform asymptotic normality for location robust

uniform asymptotic results over contamination neighborhoods. Moreover, we show
how to calculate the maximum size of the contamination neighborhoods where

that the hazard given the covariates and a random frailty unique to each
individual has the proportional hazards form multiplied by the frailty.
  The frailty is assumed to have mean 1 within a known one-parameter family of
distributions. Inference is based on a nonparametric likelihood. The behavior
of the likelihood maximizer is studied under general conditions where the
fitted model may be misspecified. The joint estimator of the regression and
frailty parameters as well as the baseline hazard is shown to be uniformly
consistent for the pseudo-value maximizing the asymptotic limit of the
likelihood. Appropriately standardized, the estimator converges weakly to a
Gaussian process. When the model is correctly specified, the procedure is
semiparametric efficient, achieving the semiparametric information bound for
all parameter components. It is also proved that the bootstrap gives valid
inferences for all parameters, even under misspecification.
  We demonstrate analytically the importance of the robust inference in several
examples. In a randomized clinical trial, a valid test of the treatment effect
is possible when other prognostic factors and the frailty distribution are both
misspecified. Under certain conditions on the covariates, the ratios of the
regression parameters are still identifiable. The practical utility of the
procedure is illustrated on a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma dataset.

observed in Gaussian white noise is set out and investigated. The prior
considered is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero and a heavy-tailed
density \gamma, with the mixing weight chosen by marginal maximum likelihood,
in the hope of adapting between sparse and dense sequences. If estimation is
then carried out using the posterior median, this is a random thresholding
procedure. Other thresholding rules employing the same threshold can also be
used. Probability bounds on the threshold chosen by the marginal maximum
likelihood approach lead to overall risk bounds over classes of signal
sequences of length n, allowing for sparsity of various kinds and degrees.
  The signal classes considered are ``nearly black'' sequences where only a
proportion \eta is allowed to be nonzero, and sequences with normalized \ell_p
norm bounded by \eta, for \eta >0 and 0<p\le 2. Estimation error is measured by
mean qth power loss, for 0<q\le 2. For all the classes considered, and for all
q in (0,2], the method achieves the optimal estimation rate as n\to \infty and
\eta \to 0 at various rates, and in this sense adapts automatically to the
sparseness or otherwise of the underlying signal. In addition the risk is
uniformly bounded over all signals. If the posterior mean is used as the
estimator, the results still hold for q>1. Simulations show excellent
performance.

rings over fields. We are interested in minimal free resolutions of these
ideals (or equivalently the quotients of the polynomial ring by the ideals)
considered as modules over the polynomial ring. There is no simple method of
finding such resolutions but in the case of Stanley-Reisner ideals Hochster's
formula and its variants provide a way to compute the Betti numbers of these
resolutions.
  Even with these formulae it is not in general possible to find especially
explicit or useful descriptions of the Betti numbers. However we restrict our
attention to those ideals which are generated by square free monomials of
degree 2. The purpose of this is to associate these ideals with graphs. This
provides a link between algebraic objects, the monomial ideals, and
combinatorial objects, the graphs. This correspondence enables us do define new
numerical invariants of graphs: the Betti numbers and projective dimension of
the corresponding graph ideals.
  We find explicit descriptions of the Betti numbers and projective dimensions
of cycles and forests. In the case of forests we find a method of describing
the Betti numbers in terms of the Betti numbers of subforests. This also leads
to a description of the projective dimension of a forests in terms of the
projective dimensions of its subforests.
  It turns out that the projective dimension of forests can be defined in
purely combinatorial terms and hence it gives a new combinatorial numerical
invariant of forests.

spin-unstable, since $S(k_{f0})<0$. The inclusion of the chiral $\pi

a $N>1$ array of quantum wells in the presence of a truncated static electric

bi-gaussian distribution. The bi-gaussian distribution is interesting for
studying the possibility of using electron cooling in RHIC. Experiments and
computer studies indicate that in the presence of electron cooling, the beam
distribution changes so that it developes a strong core and a long tail which
is not described well by a gaussian, but may be better described by a
bi-gaussian. Being able to compute the effects of intrabeam scattering for a
bi-gaussian distribution would be useful in computing the effects of electron
cooling, which depend critically on the details of the intrabeam scattering.
The calculation is done using the reformulation of intrabeam scattering theory
given in [1] based on the treatments given by A. Piwinski [2] and J. Bjorken
and S.K. Mtingwa [3]. The bi-gaussian distribution is defined below as the sum
of two gaussians in the particle coordinates $x,y,s,p_x,p_y,p_s$. The gaussian
with the smaller dimensions produces most of the core of the beam, and the
gaussian with the larger dimensions largely produces the long tail of the beam.
The final result for the growth rates are expressed as the sum of three terms
which can be interperted respectively as the contribution to the growth rates
due to the scattering of the particles in the first gaussian from themselves,
the scattering of the particles in the second gaussian from themselves, and the
scattering of the particles in the first gaussian from the particles in the
second gaussian.
