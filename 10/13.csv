dark energy (rho_Lambda, w, etc.). We compute this multivariate probability
distribution for various classes of single-field slow-roll models, exploring
its dependence on the characteristic inflationary energy scales, the shape of
the potential V and and the choice of measure underlying the calculation. We
find that unless the characteristic scale Delta-phi on which V varies happens
to be near the Planck scale, the only aspect of V that matters observationally
is the statistical distribution of its peaks and troughs. For all energy scales
and plausible measures considered, we obtain the predictions Omega_tot ~
1+-0.00001, w=-1 and rho_Lambda in the observed ballpark but uncomfortably
high. The high energy limit predicts n_s ~ 0.96, dn_s/dlnk ~ -0.0006, r ~ 0.15
and n_t ~ -0.02, consistent with observational data and indistinguishable from
eternal phi^2-inflation. The low-energy limit predicts 5 parameters but prefers
larger Q and redder n_s than observed. We discuss the coolness problem, the
smoothness problem and the pothole paradox, which severely limit the viable
class of models and measures. Our findings bode well for detecting an

relativistic leptons from their inner magnetospheres and/or pulsar wind
regions. If the binary system is compact enough, then these leptons can
initiate inverse Compton (IC) $e^\pm$ pair cascades in the anisotropic
radiation field of a massive star. $\gamma$-rays can be produced in the IC
cascade during its development in a pulsar wind region and above a shock in a
massive star wind region where the propagation of leptons is determined by the
structure of a magnetic field around the massive star. For a binary system with
specific parametres, we calculate phase dependent spectra and fluxes of
$\gamma$-rays escaping as a function of the inclination angle of the system and
for different assumptions on injection conditions of the primary leptons (their
initial spectra and location of the shock inside the binary). We conclude that
the features of $\gamma$-ray emission from such massive binaries containing

acceleration of particles by the pulsars, and on interactions of a compact
object with the massive star wind. Predicted $\gamma$-ray light curves and

  The lower D/H values are instead likely due to ""depletion"" of the D onto dust

the missing D, and it appears possible for gas-grain reactions to achieve
extreme deuteration of carbonaceous grain material. Grain destruction will
release D from the grains; the gas phase abundance of D should therefore be
positively correlated with the gas phase abundances of other elements that

the cosmic background in cosmological absorption systems is derived, as a
simple consequence of the conservation of surface brightness. The limit depends
only on the rate of incidence of the absorbers and the mean free path of the
radiation. It is found that, on average, the ionizing radiation intensity from
local sources in Lyman limit systems at z>2 must be less than half of the
intensity of the cosmic background. In absorbers with column densities much
lower than Lyman limit systems, the local source contribution must be
negligible. The limit on the ratio of local source to background intensities is
then applied to the class of damped Lya absorption systems with detectable
excited CII lines. A cooling rate of the gas in these systems has been measured
by Wolfe et al., who assumed that the balancing heating source is photoelectric
heating on dust by light at ~ 1500 A . The intensity from local star formation
at this wavelength in this class of damped Lya systems is found to be at most ~
3 times the background intensity. If the heating source is indeed photoelectric
heating of dust, the background created by sources associated with damped Lya
systems can then be estimated from the average cooling rates measured in the
absorbers. Current results yield a background intensity higher than previous
estimates based on observed galaxy and quasar luminosity functions, although
with a large uncertainty. The possibility of other sources of heating, such as
shock-heating in a turbulent medium, should be explored.

emission and the apparent competition between two accreting poles. However, in

resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope to study the structure and energetics

central black hole masses, star formation histories, and nebular properties.
This paper provides a description of the experimental design, and new findings
from the study of emission lines. The sample targets span a range of nebular
spectroscopic class, from HII to Seyfert nuclei. The line ratios indicative of
nebular ionization show only modest variations over order-of-magnitude
differences in radius, and demonstrate in a systematic way that geometrical
dilution of the radiation field from a central source cannot be assumed as a
primary driver of ionization structure. Comparisons between large- and
small-aperture measurements for the HII/LINER transition objects provide a new
test that challenges conventional wisdom concerning the composite nature of
these systems. We also list a number of other quantitative results that are of
interest for understanding galaxy nuclei, including (1) the spatial
distribution/degree of concentration of H-alpha emission as a function of
nebular type; (2) the radial variation in electron density as a function of
nebular type; and (3) quantitative broad H-alpha estimates obtained at a second
epoch for these low-luminosity nuclei. The resulting measurements provide a new
basis for comparing the nuclei of other galaxies with that of the Milky Way. We
find that the Galactic Center is representative across a wide span of
properties as a low-luminosity emission-line nucleus.

omega, is even a few degrees on sub-parsec scales. The resulting apparent

freedom of an electron in addition to the charge degree of freedom, have been
proposed to provide simultaneous non-volatile storage and signal processing
functionality. Here, we show that some of these transistors unfortunately may
not have sufficient voltage and current gains for signal processing. This is
primarily because of a large output ac conductance and poor isolation between
input and output. The latter also hinders unidirectional propagation of logic
signal from the input of a logic gate to the output. Other versions of these
transistors appear to have better gain and isolation, but not better than those
of a conventional transistor. Therefore, these devices may not improve
state-of-the-art signal processing capability, although they may provide
additional functionality by offering non-volatile storage. They may also have
niche applications in non-linear circuits.

these are defined in terms of two connected effective non-Markovian stochastic

itself (the latter is absent in `fake' history models). The result is an exact
theory, from which one can calculate from first principles both the persistent

estimation of the level of conversational engagement between users of a voice
communication system. We begin by using machine learning techniques, such as
the support vector machine (SVM), to classify users' emotions as expressed in
individual utterances. However, this alone fails to model the temporal and
interactive aspects of conversational engagement. We therefore propose the use
of a multilevel structure based on coupled hidden Markov models (HMM) to
estimate engagement levels in continuous natural speech. The first level is
comprised of SVM-based classifiers that recognize emotional states, which could
be (e.g.) discrete emotion types or arousal/valence levels. A high-level HMM
then uses these emotional states as input, estimating users' engagement in
conversation by decoding the internal states of the HMM. We report experimental
results obtained by applying our algorithms to the LDC Emotional Prosody and
CallFriend speech corpora.

invariance of the background geometry, it is plausible that this effect could
generate some electromagnetic field amplification. We show that this scenario
is equivalent to endowing the photon with a large negative mass during
inflation. This effective mass is negligibly small in a radiation and matter

we show that the seed required by the dynamo mechanism can be generated. We

properties different from those of the SM Higgs boson. Existing searches for
the Higgs boson are sensitive to the possible production and decay of radions

CP-even branching ratios of the third generation squarks show a pronounced
dependence on the phases of A_t, A_b, mu and M_1 in a large region of the
supersymmetric parameter space. This could have important implications for stop
and sbottom searches and the MSSM parameter determination in future collider
experiments. We have estimated the expected accuracy in the determination of
the parameters by global fits of measured masses, decay branching ratios and
production cross sections. We have found that the parameter A_t can be

the order of 50 - 100%. In addition we have studied CP-odd observables, like
asymmetries based on triple product correlations, which are necessary to
unambiguously establish CP violation. We have analysed these asymmetries in
neutralino and chargino production with subsequent three-body decays at the
International Linear Collider with longitudinally polarised beams in the MSSM

IceCube. When the resonant channel dominates in the total \chi-e,\chi-q
scattering cross section, the only model parameters affecting the corresponding
visible signal rates turn out to be the physical masses of the resonant
right-scalar and of the lightest neutralino. We compare the expected number of
supersymmetric events with the rates corresponding to the expected Glashow W
resonance and to the continuum UHE \nu-N scattering for realistic power-law
spectra. We find that the event rate in the leptonic selectron channel is
particularly promising, and can reach a few tens for a one-year exposure in
IceCube. Finally, we note that UHE neutralinos at much higher energies (up to
hundreds ZeV) may produce sneutrino resonances by scattering off relic

polarized structure functions of the constituent quark, the double distribution

both the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi and the
Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage regions, for small values of the momentum
transfer and of the skewedness parameter. In this kinematical region, the

sections relevant to deeply virtual Compton scattering. In particular, we have

equations for gravity coupled to a scalar field theory with two, possibly
degenerate, vacua. In these solutions the scalar field crosses the top of the

how the maximum allowed value of $k$ depends on the parameters of the theory.
For a wide class of potentials $k_{\rm max}$ is determined by the value of the
second derivative of the scalar field potential at the top of the barrier.
However, in other cases, such as potentials with relatively flat barriers, the
determining parameter appears instead to be the value of this second derivative
averaged over the width of the barrier. As a byproduct, we gain additional
insight into the conditions under which a Coleman-De Luccia bounce exists. We

inclusion of the algebraic integers $\oo$ in a number field $\kk$, and we
construct a C*-dynamical system on the corresponding Hecke C*-algebra,
analogous to the one constructed by Bost and Connes for the inclusion of the
integers in the rational numbers. We describe the structure of the resulting
Hecke C*-algebra as a semigroup crossed product and then, in the case of class
number one, analyze the equilibrium (KMS) states of the dynamical system. The
extreme KMS$_\beta$ states at low-temperature exhibit a phase transition with
symmetry breaking that strongly suggests a connection with class field theory.
Indeed, for purely imaginary fields of class number one, the group of
symmetries, which acts freely and transitively on the extreme KMS$_\infty$
states, is isomorphic to the Galois group of the maximal abelian extension over
the field. However, the Galois action on the restrictions of extreme
KMS$_\infty$ states to the (arithmetic) Hecke algebra over $\kk$, as given by
class-field theory, corresponds to the action of the symmetry group if and only
if the number field $\kk$ is $\Q$.

  using microscopic simulators","16 pages, submitted to CTAC 2004",,,,"math.DS math.NA",,"  We are developing a framework for multiscale computation which enables models
at a ``microscopic'' level of description, for example Lattice Boltzmann, Monte
Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators, to perform modelling tasks at the
``macroscopic'' length scales of interest. The plan is to use the microscopic
rules restricted to small patches of the domain, the ``teeth'', followed by
interpolation to estimate macroscopic fields in the ``gaps''. The challenge
addressed here is to find general boundary conditions for the patches of
microscopic simulators that appropriately connect the widely separated
``teeth'' to achieve high order accuracy over the macroscale. Here we start
exploring the issues in the simplest case when the microscopic simulator is the
quintessential example of a partial differential equation. For this case
analytic solutions provide comparisons. We argue that classic high-order
interpolation provides patch boundary conditions which achieve arbitrarily
high-order consistency in the gap-tooth scheme, and with care are numerically
stable. The high-order consistency is demonstrated on a class of linear partial
differential equations in two ways: firstly using the dynamical systems
approach of holistic discretisation; and secondly through the eigenvalues of
selected numerical problems. When applied to patches of microscopic simulations
these patch boundary conditions should achieve efficient macroscale simulation.

of their zeros in the open interval $(-1,1)$. This property is no longer valid
for other values of the parameters; in general, zeros are complex. In this
paper we study the strong asymptotics of Jacobi polynomials where the real
parameters $\alpha_n,\beta_n$ depend on $n$ in such a way that $$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\alpha_{n}}{n}=A, \quad
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\beta_{n}}{n}=B, $$ with $A,B \in \mathbb{R}$. We
restrict our attention to the case where the limits $A,B$ are not both positive
and take values outside of the triangle bounded by the straight lines A=0, B=0
and $A+B+2=0$. As a corollary, we show that in the limit the zeros distribute
along certain curves that constitute trajectories of a quadratic differential.
  The non-hermitian orthogonality relations for Jacobi polynomials with varying
parameters lie in the core of our approach; in the cases we consider, these
relations hold on a single contour of the complex plane. The asymptotic
analysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method based on the

from nucleon-nucleon interactions of $v_4$ type. The wave function is built as
the product of three terms, a Jastrow correlation factor, a linear correlation
factor and a model wave function. The correlation factors account for both the
short range repulsive and the spin and isospin dependence of the nuclear
potential. The model wave function is antisymmetric and has the values of the
angular momentum and parity of the state under description. For the model wave
function we have used two different schemes. The first one is based on a
Harmonic Oscillator shell model with and without deformation, and the second
one is based on the Margenau-Brink model of alpha clustering. Projection
operators of parity and total angular momentum are used. The performance of
these two models is studied and compared systematically. Wave functions for the
ground state and some members of its rotational band and some other bound
states of these nuclei have been obtained. Binding energies, root mean square
radius and the expectation value of the kinetic energy and the different

decay modes of Lambda-hypernuclei are described: the mesonic mode and the
non-mesonic ones. The latter are the dominant decay channels of medium--heavy
hypernuclei, where, on the contrary, the mesonic decay is disfavoured by Pauli
blocking effect on the outgoing nucleon. In particular, one can distinguish
between one-body and two-body induced decays. Theoretical models employed to
evaluate the (partial and total) decay widths of hypernuclei are illustrated,
and their results compared with existing experimental data. Open problems and
recent achievements are extensively discussed, in particular the determination
of the ratio Gamma_n/Gamma_p, possible tests of the Delta I=1/2 rule in
non-mesonic decays and the puzzling asymmetric non-mesonic decay of polarized

already available, with a central Server running common services and several
clients connecting to it. Mammograms can be acquired in any location; the
related information required to select and access them at any time is stored in
a common service called Data Catalogue, which can be queried by any client. The
result of a query can be used as input for analysis algorithms, which are
executed on nodes that are in general remote to the user (but always local to

nucleotide sequences (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965). Recently we introduced a
novel method, termed `volatility', to estimate selection pressures on protein
sequences from their synonymous codon usage (Plotkin and Dushoff 2003, Plotkin
et al 2004a). Here we provide a theoretical foundation for this approach. We
derive the expected frequencies of synonymous codons as a function of the
strength of selection, the mutation rate, and the effective population size. We
analyze the conditions under which we can expect to draw inferences from biased
codon usage, and we estimate the time scales required to establish and maintain
such a signal. Our results indicate that, over a broad range of parameters,
synonymous codon usage can reliably distinguish between negative selection,
positive selection, and neutrality. While the power of volatility to detect
negative selection depends on the population size, there is no such dependence
for the detection of positive selection. Furthermore, we show that phenomena
such as transient hyper-mutators in microbes can improve the power of
volatility to detect negative selection, even when the typical observed neutral
site heterozygosity is low.

measurements is allowed (which requires classical communication), and show that
the corresponding error probability is exactly equal to the collective one for
any number of copies. We show that this strategy can be regarded as Bayesian
updating.

protective measurements}, more appropriately {\it adiabatic measurements} of a
spin 1/2 system where the {\it apparatus} is also a quantum system with a {\em
finite dimensional Hilbert space}. This circumvents several technical as well
as conceptual issues that arise when dealing with an infinite dimensional
Hilbert space as in the analysis of conventional Stern-Gerlach experiment. Here
also it is demonstrated that the response of the detector is continuous and it
{\it directly} measures {\em expectation values without altering the state of
the system}(when the unknown original state is a {\it nondegenerate eigenstate
of the system Hamiltonian}, in the limit of {\em ideal} adiabatic conditions.
We have also computed the corrections arising out of the inevitable departures
from ideal adiabaticity i.e the time of measurement being large but finite. To
overcome the {\em conceptual} difficulties with a {\it quantum apparatus}, we
have simulated a {\it classical apparatus} as a {\em large} assembly of
spin-1/2 systems. We end this article with a conclusion and a discussion of
some future issues.

initial narrow wavepacket is reconstructed after its dynamics is time-reversed
with a perturbed Hamiltonian. In the semiclassical regime of perturbation, we
show that the variance first rises algebraically up to a critical time $t_c$,
after which it decays. To leading order in the effective Planck's constant
$\hbar_{\rm eff}$, this decay is given by the sum of a classical term $\simeq
\exp[-2 \lambda t]$, a quantum term $\simeq 2 \hbar_{\rm eff} \exp[-\Gamma t]$
and a mixed term $\simeq 2 \exp[-(\Gamma+\lambda)t]$. Compared to the behavior
of the average fidelity, this allows for the extraction of the classical
Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ in a larger parameter range. Our results are
confirmed by numerical simulations.

operator that we call {\em comb} in reference to the {\em hairy-ball theorem}.
For qubits (or spin 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under
$SL(2,\CC)$. This implies that the {\em filters} obtained from the combs are
entanglement monotones by construction. We give alternative formulae for the
concurrence and the 3-tangle as expectation values of certain antilinear
operators. As an application we discuss inequivalent types of genuine
four-qubit entanglement.
