direct measure of the detailed star formation history in a stellar population.
With large investments of observing time, HST can obtain such data for
populations out to 1 Mpc, but its field of view is extremely small in
comparison to the size of Local Group galaxies. This limitation severely
constrains our understanding of galaxy formation. For example, the largest
galaxy in the Local Group, Andromeda, offers an ideal laboratory for studying
the formation of large spiral galaxies, but the galaxy shows substructure on a
variety of scales, presumably due to its violent merger history. Within its
remaining lifetime, HST can only sample a few sight-lines through this complex
galaxy. In contrast, a wide field imager could provide a map of Andromeda's
halo, outer disk, and tidal streams, revealing the spatially-dependent star
formation history in each structure. The same data would enable many secondary
studies, such as the age variation in Andromeda's globular cluster system,
gigantic samples of variable stars, and microlensing tracers of the galaxy's
dark matter distribution.

damage from exposure to soft protons during passages through the Earth's

transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the eight front illuminated CCDs by more than
two orders of magnitude. The ACIS instrument team is continuing to study the
properties of the damage with an emphasis on developing techniques to mitigate
CTI and spectral resolution degradation. We will discuss the characteristics of
the damage, the detector and the particle background and how they conspire to
degrade the instrument performance. We have developed a model for ACIS CTI
which can be used to correct each event and regain some of the lost
performance. The correction uses a map of the electron trap distribution, a
parameterization of the energy dependent charge loss and the fraction of the
lost charge re-emitted into the trailing pixel to correct the pixels in the
event island. This model has been implemented in the standard Chandra data
processing pipeline. Some of the correction algorithm was inspired by the
earlier work on ACIS CTI correction by Townsley et al. (2000; 2002). The
details of the CTI model and how each parameter improves performance will be
discussed, as well as the limitations and the possibilities for future

variables on the H-R diagram, and we propose a connection with the bistability
jump in the winds of early-type supergiants. There appears to be a deficiency
of quiescent LBVs on the S Dor instability strip at luminosities between log
L/Lsun = 5.6 and 5.8. The upper boundary, is also where the
temperature-dependent S Dor instability strip intersects the bistability jump
at about 21,000 K. Due to increased opacity, winds of early-type supergiants
are slower and denser on the cool side of the bistability jump, and we
postulate that this may trigger optically-thick winds that inhibit quiescent
LBVs from residing there. We conduct numerical simulations of radiation-driven
winds for a range of temperatures, masses, and velocity laws at log L/Lsun=5.7
to see what effect the bistability jump should have. We find that for
relatively low stellar masses the increase in wind density at the bistability
jump leads to the formation of a modest to strong pseudo photosphere -- enough
to make an early B-type star appear as a yellow hypergiant. Thus, the proposed
mechanism will be most relevant for LBVs that are post-red supergiants. Yellow
hypergiants like IRC+10420 and rho Cas occupy the same luminosity range as the
``missing'' LBVs, and show apparent temperature variations at constant
luminosity. If these yellow hypergiants do eventually become Wolf-Rayet stars,
we speculate that they may skip the normal LBV phase, at least as far as their
apparent positions on the HR diagram are concerned.

ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum of QSOs at z < 0.67. After consideration of many
possible sources of systematic error in our analysis, we find that the spectral
slope of the FUSE composite spectrum, \alpha= -0.56^+0.38_-0.28 for F_\nu

prominent emission lines in the \fuse composite and find that the
high-ionization O VI and Ne VIII emission lines are enhanced relative to the
HST composite. Power law continuum fits to the individual FUSE AGN spectra
reveal a correlation between EUV spectral slope and AGN luminosity in the FUSE
and FUSE + HST samples in the sense that lower luminosity AGNs show harder
spectral slopes. We find an anticorrelation between the hardness of the EUV
spectral slope and AGN black hole mass, using estimates of this quantity found
in the literature. We interpret these results in the context of the well-known
anticorrelation between AGN luminosity and emission line strength, the Baldwin

low temperatures is the ""normal"" (as opposed to the Umklapp) spin-phonon
scattering in which the non-equilibrium momentum is transferred from the spin
subsystem to phonons where it quickly relaxes through the ""phonon bath"".
Because of the lower dimensionality of the spin excitations it is only the
momentum along the chains which is conserved in such a scattering. We find that
this effect leads to a particular momentum- and temperature-dependence of the
spin-phonon relaxation rate valid for the broad class of low-dimensional spin
systems. Subsequently we demonstrate that the spin-phonon relaxation mechanism
is insufficient for the low-energy, long-wavelength 1D spin-chain excitations,
which make the thermal conductivity diverge. We complete our consideration by
taking into account the impurity scattering, which in 1D cuts off the
quasi-ballistic spin excitations and renders the thermal conductivity finite.
Our results compare very well with the existing experimental data for Sr2CuO3.
Using our microscopic insight into the problem we propose further experiments
and predict an unusual impurity concentration dependence for a number of
quantities.

the properties of a meron wavefunction and a natural ""quasi-hole"" wave function
are dramatically different due to the broken symmetry and the associated
Goldstone mode in the bulk. Although the (smallest) meron has localized charge
$ 1/2 $ and logarithmically divergent energy, the charge of the quasi-hole
excitation extends over the whole system and its energy diverges linearly with
the area of the system. This indicates that the natural quasi-hole wavefunction
is not a good trial wavefunction for excitations. It also shows that the energy
of the naive candidate for a pair of meron wavefunction written down previously
increases quadratically instead of logarithmically as their separation
increases. Our results indicate that qualitatively good trial wave functions

quantum Hall system at finite $ d $ are still not available and searching for
them remains an important open problem.

viewed as a grand challenge for scientists and engineers. For operation at high

requirement. Although doping has been found to impede degradation, the lack of
atomistic understanding of the pertinent mechanism has hindered optimization.
For example, porous gamma-Al2O3, a widely used catalyst and catalytic support,
transforms to non-porous alpha-Al2O3 at ~1,100C. Doping with La raises the
transformation temperature to ~1,250C, but it has not been possible to
establish if La atoms enter the bulk, adsorb on surfaces as single atoms or
clusters, or form surface compounds. Here, we use direct imaging by
aberration-corrected Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy
coupled with extended X-ray absorption fine structure and first-principles
calculations to demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, stabilization is
achieved by isolated La atoms adsorbed on the surface. Strong binding and
mutual repulsion of La atoms effectively pin the surface and inhibit both
sintering and the transformation to alpha-Al2O3. The results provide the first
guidelines for the choice of dopants to prevent thermal degradation of

amplitude is strongly suppressed, and then the off-diagonal gluon phase shows
strong randomness, which leads to a large effective off-diagonal gluon mass,
$M_{\rm off} \simeq 1.2 {\rm GeV}$. Due to the large off-diagonal gluon mass in
the MA gauge, infrared QCD is abelianized like nonabelian Higgs theories. In
the MA gauge, there appears a macroscopic network of the monopole world-line
covering the whole system. From the monopole current, we extract the dual gluon
field $B_\mu$, and examine the longitudinal magnetic screening. We obtain $m_B
\simeq$ 0.5 GeV in the infrared region, which indicates the dual Higgs
mechanism by monopole condensation. From infrared abelian dominance and
infrared monopole condensation, low-energy QCD in the MA gauge is described
with the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory.

which is invariant with respect to conformal transformations of the metric.
  In this paper we show how conformal relativity is related to the Brans-Dicke
theory and to the low-energy-effective superstring theory. We show that
conformal relativity action is equaivalent to a transformed Brans-Dicke action
for Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega = -3/2$ in contrast to a reduced
(graviton-dilaton) low-energy-effective superstring action which corresponds to
a Brans-Dicke action with Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega = -1$. In fact,
Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega =-3/2$ gives a border between a standard scalar
field evolution and a ghost.
  We also present basic cosmological solutions of conformal relativity in both
Einstein and string frames. The Eintein limit for flat conformal cosmology
solutions is unique and it is flat Minkowski space. This requires the scalar
field/mass evolution instead of the scale factor evolution in order to explain
cosmological redshift.
  It is interesting that like in ekpyrotic/cyclic models, a possible transition
through a singularity in conformal cosmology in the string frame takes place in
the weak coupling regime.

-2 sectors, which is consistent with all of the available experimental binding
energies of $S=0, -1$ and -2 $s$-shell (hyper-)nuclei, can predict a particle
stable bound state of $^4_{\Lambda\Lambda}$H.
  For $^5_{\Lambda\Lambda}$H and $^5_{\Lambda\Lambda}$He, $\Lambda N-\Sigma N$
and $\Xi N-\Lambda\Sigma$ potentials enhance the net $\Lambda\Lambda-N\Xi$
coupling, and a large $\Xi$ probability is obtained even for a weaker
$\Lambda\Lambda-N\Xi$ potential.

arbitrary gas expansion is considered. On the basis of the Thomson circulation
theorem an implicit integral of the flow equations is constructed. With the
help of this integral, a simple explicit expression for the vortex mode of the
burnt gas flow near the flame front is obtained. Furthermore, a dispersion
relation for the potential mode at the flame front is written down, thus
reducing the initial system of bulk equations and jump conditions for the flow
variables to a set of integro-differential equations for the flame front
position and the flow velocity at the front. The developed approach is applied
to the case of thin flames. Finally, an asymptotic expansion of the derived
equations is carried out in the case \theta\to 1 where \theta is the gas
expansion coefficient, and a single equation for the front position is obtained
in the second post-Sivashinsky approximation. It is demonstrated, in
particular, how the well-known problem of correct normalization of the front
velocity is resolved in the new approach. It is verified also that in the first
post-Sivashinsky approximation, the new equation reduces to the
Sivashinsky-Clavin equation corrected according to Cambray and Joulin.
Analytical solutions of the derived equations are found, and compared with the
results of numerical simulations.

equivalent to the Bohmian equations of motion, has been used to obtain
numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation. Problems, however, have been
experienced near wave function nodes (or low probability regions). Here we
attempt to compute wave functions and Bohmian trajectories for the interference
of one particle or of two identical particles. It turns out that the large
number of nodes (i.e. interference minima) makes the hydrodynamic equations
impractical, whereas a more straightforward solution of the Schrodinger
equation gives very good results.
