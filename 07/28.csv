density contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1Mpc, and on spectral type, determined
from principal component analysis. We find that the galaxy populations at both
extremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. The
population in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,
a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudes
brighter than M_bJ-5log10h <-18.5. In contrast, cluster regions have a relative
excess of very bright early-type galaxies with M_bJ-5log10h < -21. Differences
in the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: at
M_bJ-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparable
abundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order of
magnitude. We find that the luminosity functions measured in all density
environments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by Schechter
functions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in a
fashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. These
observed variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of the
overall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, may
prove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

bar-driven evolution in disk galaxies, particularly bulge formation. N-body
simulations are used to construct stellar kinematic bar diagnostics for edge-on
systems and to quantify the expected vertical structure of bars, and they are
compared to observations of 30 edge-on spirals, most with a boxy bulge.
Long-slit spectra of the galaxies show characteristic double-hump rotation
curves, dispersion profiles with secondary peaks and/or flat maxima, and
correlated h3 and V profiles, indicating that most of them harbor edge-on bars.
The presence of cold, quasi-axisymmetric central stellar disks is also
suggested, presumably formed through bar-driven gaseous inflow and star
formation. K-band imaging of the same galaxies spectacularly highlights radial
variations of the bars' scaleheights, as expected from vertical disk
instabilities. The light profiles also vary radially in shape but never
approach a classic de Vaucouleurs law. Filtering of the images further isolates
the specific orbit families at the origin of the boxy structure, which can be
directly related to periodic orbit calculations in 3D barred potentials. Bars
are thus shown to contribute substantially to the formation of both large-scale
triaxial bulges and embedded central disks. Relevant results from the SAURON
survey of the stellar/ionized-gas kinematics and stellar populations of
spheroids are also described. Examples are used to illustrate the potential of
coupling stellar kinematics and linestrengths (age and metallicity), here
specifically to unravel the dynamical evolution and related chemical enrichment

been used to map the position and velocity distributions of tidal debris from
the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy entirely around the Galaxy. We
compare this data set to both test particle orbits and N-body simulations of
satellite destruction run within a variety of rigid Milky Way potentials and
find that the mass of the Milky Way within 50 kpc of its center should be
3.8-5.6 x 10^11 Msun in order for any Sgr orbit to simultaneously fit the
velocity gradient in the Sgr trailing debris and the apocenter of the Sgr
leading debris. Orbital pole precession of young debris and leading debris
velocities in regions corresponding to older debris provide contradictory
evidence in favor of oblate/prolate Galactic halo potentials respectively,
leading us to conclude that the orbit of Sgr has evolved over the past few Gyr.
  Based upon the velocity dispersion and width along the trailing tidal stream
we estimate the current bound mass of Sgr to be M_Sgr = 2 - 5 x 10^8 Msun
independant of the form of the Galactic potential; this corresponds to a range
of mass to light ratios (M/L)_Sgr = 14 - 36 (M/L)_Sun for the Sgr core. Models
with masses in this range best fit the apocenter of leading Sgr tidal debris
when they orbit with a radial period of roughly 0.85 Gyr and have periGalactica
and apoGalactica of about 15 kpc and 60 kpc respectively. These distances will
scale with the assumed distance to the Sgr dwarf and the assumed depth of the
Galactic potential. The density distribution of debris along the orbit in these
models is consistent with the M giant observations, and debris at all orbital
phases where M giants are obviously present is younger (i.e. was lost more

wavelength range 1100-9800 A. A first modeling of the cluster was performed
using integrated properties, such as the spectral energy distribution (SED),
broad band colors, nebular emission Hbeta equivalent width, the main
ultraviolet resonance lines, and the presence of Wolf-Rayet star features. By
applying standard assumptions about the initial mass function (IMF), we were
unable to fit satisfactorily these observational data. This contradictory
result led us to carry out a second modeling, based on a resolved photometric
analysis of individual stars in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, by means
of finding the best fit isochrone in color-magnitude diagrams (CMD), and
assigning a theoretical SED to each individual star. The overall SED of the
cluster, obtained by integrating the individual stellar SEDs, is found to fit
better the observed SED than the best solution found through the integrated
first analysis, but at a significantly later stage of evolution of the cluster
of 4.2 Myr, as obtained from the best fit to the CMD. A comparative analysis of
both methods traces the different results to the effects of statistical
fluctuations in the upper end of the IMF, which are significant in NGC 588,
with a computed cluster mass of 5600 Msun, as predicted by Cervino et al

determination the rate of change of the gravitational constant (G-dot), and an
anomalous constant acceleration (aa) directed towards the Sun (Pioneer

these two parameters are 9.5*10**(-15)/yr for G-dot/G and 2.0*10**(-16) m/s2

present an analysis of the effects of destriping errors on CMB power spectrum
estimates for Planck-like scanning strategies. Analytic formulae are derived
for certain simple scanning geometries that can be rescaled to account for
different detector noise. Assuming {Planck-like low-frequency noise, the noise
power spectrum is accurately white at high multipoles (l<50). D estriping
errors, though dominant at lower multipoles, are small in comparison to the
cosmic variance. These results show that simple destriping map-making methods
should be perfectly adequate for the analysis of Planck data and support the
arguments given in an earlier paper in favour of applying a fast hybrid power
spectrum estimator to CMB data with realistic `1/f' noise.

phase, characterized by the process of jet/ambient mixing and momentum
transfer. Models undergoing qualitatively different non-linear evolution are
clearly grouped in well-separated regions in a jet Lorentz
factor/jet-to-ambient enthalpy diagram. Jets with a low Lorentz factor and
small enthalpy ratio are disrupted by a strong shock after saturation. Those
with a large Lorentz factor and enthalpy ratio are unstable although the
process of mixing and momentum exchange proceeds to a longer time scale due to
a steady conversion of kinetic to internal energy in the jet. In these cases,
the high value of the initial Lorentz seems to prevent transversal velocity
from growing far enough to generate the strong shock that breaks the slower
jets. Finally, jets with either high Lorentz factors and small enthalpy ratios
or low Lorentz factors and large enthalpy ratios appear as the most stable.

interclump emission. Four of the clearly barred galaxies at z~0.8-1.2 have
grand design spirals. The bar fraction was determined as a function of galaxy
inclination and compared with the analogous distribution in the local Universe.
The bar fraction was also determined as a function of galaxy angular size.
These distributions suggest that inclination and resolution effects obscure
nearly half of the bars in our sample. The bar fraction was also determined as
a function of redshift. We found a nearly constant bar fraction of 0.23+-0.03
from z~0 to z=1.1. When corrected for inclination and size effects, this
fraction is comparable to the bar fraction in the local Universe, ~0.4, as

Then, one can use other combinations of frequencies as probes for the

including spiral arm instabilities and supernovae, and it affects the rate and
morphology of star formation, energy dissipation, and angular momentum transfer
in galaxy disks. Star formation is initiated on large scales by gravitational
instabilities which control the overall rate through the long dynamical time
corresponding to the average ISM density. Stars form at much higher densities
than average, however, and at much faster rates locally, so the slow average
rate arises because the fraction of the gas mass that forms stars at any one
time is low, ~10^{-4}. This low fraction is determined by turbulence
compression, and is apparently independent of specific cloud formation
processes which all operate at lower densities. Turbulence compression also
accounts for the formation of most stars in clusters, along with the cluster
mass spectrum, and it gives a hierarchical distribution to the positions of
these clusters and to star-forming regions in general. Turbulent motions appear
to be very fast in irregular galaxies at high redshift, possibly having speeds
equal to several tenths of the rotation speed in view of the morphology of
chain galaxies and their face-on counterparts. The origin of this turbulence is
not evident, but some of it could come from accretion onto the disk. Such high
turbulence could help drive an early epoch of gas inflow through viscous
torques in galaxies where spiral arms and bars are weak. Such evolution may
lead to bulge or bar formation, or to bar re-formation if a previous bar
dissolved. We show evidence that the bar fraction is about constant with
redshift out to z~1, and model the formation and destruction rates of bars
required to achieve this constancy.

to an effective temperature ~3% lower than the actual simulation temperature

agreed to be a result of competition between crystal phases with different
electronic, magnetic, and structural order; a competition which can be strong
enough to cause phase separation between metallic ferromagnet and insulating
charge modulated states. Nevertheless, closer inspection of phase diagrams in
many manganites reveals complex phases where the two order parameters of
magnetism and charge modulation unexpectedly coexist. Here we show that such
experiments can be naturally explained within a phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau theory. In contrast to models where phase separation originates
from disorder or as a strain induced kinetic phenomenon, we argue that magnetic
and charge modulation coexist in new thermodynamic phases. This leads to a rich
diagram of equilibrium phases, qualitatively similar to those seen in
experiment. The success of this model argues for a fundamental reinterpretation
of the nature of charge modulation in these materials from a localised to a
more extended ""charge density wave"" picture. The same symmetry considerations
that favour textured coexistance of charge and magnetic order may apply to many
electronic systems with competing phases. The resulting ""Electronically soft""
phases of matter with incommensurate, inhomogeneous and mixed order may be
general phenomena in correlated systems.

state of (finite) atomic wires deposited on metallic surfaces. A
phenomenological model based on symmetry arguments suggests that the
magnetization of a ferromagnetic wire is aligned either normal to the wire and,
generally, tilted with respect to the surface normal or parallel to the wire.
  From a first principles point of view, this simple model can be best related
to the so--called magnetic force theorem calculations being often used to
explore magnetic anisotropy energies of bulk and surface systems. The second
theoretical approach we use to search for the canted magnetic ground state is
first principles adiabatic spin dynamics extended to the case of fully
relativistic electron scattering. First, for the case of two adjacent Fe atoms
an a Cu(111) surface we demonstrate that the reduction of the surface symmetry
can indeed lead to canted magnetism. The anisotropy constants and consequently
the ground state magnetization direction are very sensitive to the position of
the dimer with respect to the surface. We also performed calculations for a
seven--atom Co chain placed along a step edge of a Pt(111) surface. As far as
the ground state spin orientation is concerned we obtain excellent agreement
with experiment. Moreover, the magnetic ground state turns out to be slightly
noncollinear.

G_A and G_B be two directed graphs. We define a similarity matrix whose (i,

iterates of a linear transformation. In the special case where G_A=G_B=G, the
matrix is square and the (i, j)-th entry is the similarity score between the
vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg's ""hub and authority"" method
to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case
of our definition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a
unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our
similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a
non-negative matrix. Potential applications of our similarity concept are
numerous. We illustrate an application for the automatic extraction of synonyms

by the Two-Step Multi-Bosonic Algorithm (TSMB) for dynamical fermions. A new
set of configurations has been generated on a 16^3x32 lattice at beta=2.3 and

Guided by predictions from low energy Lagrangians, we consider spin-1/2, scalar

investigation because of the extremely noisy correlators. In particular,
meson-like correlators contain disconnected contributions. The larger
time-extention of the 16^3x32 lattice allows to observe two-state signals in
the effective mass. Finite-volume effects are monitored by comparing results
from the two lattice sizes.

simple analytical view and are expressed through finite number of elementary
functions (unlike some reflectionless potentials, which are constructed on the
basis of soliton solutions or are shape invariant in one or many steps with
involving scaling of parameters, and are expressed through series), is
obtained. An analysis of absolute transparency existence for the potential
which has the inverse power dependence on space coordinate (and here tunneling
is possible), i.e. which has the form $V(x) = \pm \alpha / |x-x_{0}|^{n}$
(where $\alpha$ and $x_{0}$ are constants, $n$ is natural number), is
fulfilled. It is shown that such a potential can be reflectionless at n = 2

constructed. Isospectral expansions of this hierarchy is analyzed.

the spin polarization of currents is parallel to the local magnetization vector

current inside the domain wall results in an adiabatical spin transfer torque
on the magnetization. We show that domain wall motion driven by this spin
torque has many unique features that do not exist in the conventional wall
motion driven by a magnetic field. By analytically and numerically solving the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation along with the adiabatic spin torque in
magnetic nanowires, we find the domain wall has its maximum velocity at the
initial application of the current but the velocity decreases to zero as the
domain wall begins to deform during its motion. We have computed domain wall
displacement and domain wall deformation of nanowires, and concluded that the
spin torque based on the adiabatic propagation of the spin current in the
domain wall is unable to maintain wall movement. We also introduce a novel
concept of domain wall inductance to characterize the capacity of the
spin-torque induced magnetic energy stored in a domain wall. In the presence of
domain wall pinning centers, we construct a phase diagram for the domain wall
depinning by the combined action of the magnetic field and the spin current.

possible tool to compute or estimate this norm. In this note we give an
expression for the Fourier coefficients $c(n)$ of $f+1$, when $f$ is a function
defined as above. As an application, we derive an expression for
$M_{f}(s)\adef\int_{0}^{1}(f(x)+1) x^{s-1} dx$ as a series that only depends on
$M_{f}(2k)$, $k\in\nn$. We remark that the Fourier coefficients $c(n)$ depend
on $M_{f}(2k)$ which, for a function $f$ defined as above, can be expressed
also in terms of the $a_{k}$'s and $\theta_{k}$'s. Therefore, a better control
on these parameters will allow to estimate $M_{f}(2k)$ and therefore eventually
to handle $\norma{f+1}$ via our expression for the Fourier coefficients and
Parsevall Identity.

$H$. Our approach is through the {\it branching algebra}, the algebra of
covariants for $H$ in the regular functions on the natural torus bundle over
the flag manifold for $G$. We give concrete descriptions of (natural
subalgebras of) the branching algebra using classical invariant theory. In this
context, it turns out that the ten classes of classical symmetric pairs $(G,H)$
are associated in pairs, $(G,H)$ and $(H',G')$, and that the (partial)
branching algebra for $(G,H)$ also describes a branching law from $H'$ to $G'$.
(However, the second branching law may involve certain infinite-dimensional
highest weight modules for $H'$.) To highlight the fact that these algebras
describe two branching laws simultaneously, we call them {\it reciprocity
algebras}. Our description of the reciprocity algebras reveals that they all
are related to the tensor product algebra for $GL_n$. This relation is
especially strong in the {\it stable range}. We give quite explicit
descriptions of reciprocity algebras in the stable range in terms of the tensor
product algebra for $GL_n$. This is the structure lying behind formulas for
branching multiplicities in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

ray optics is largely based on two-by-two matrices or $ABCD$ matrices, the
Lorentz group is bound to be the basic language for ray optics, including

describes how to exactly simulate an arbitrary unitary on multiple qudits using
a 2d-1 parameter family of single qudit and two qudit gates. Their technique is
based on the spectral decomposition of unitaries. Here we generalize this
argument to show that exact universality follows given a discrete set of single
qudit Hamiltonians and one two-qudit Hamiltonian. The technique is related to
the QR-matrix decomposition of numerical linear algebra. We consider a generic
physical system in which the single qudit Hamiltonians are a small collection
of H_{jk}^x=\hbar\Omega (|k><j|+|j><k|) and H_{jk}^y =\hbar\Omega
(i|k><j|-i|j><k|). A coupling graph results taking nodes 0,... d-1 and edges

follows iff this graph is connected, and complete universality results if the

(iii) two photons in two spatially separate high-Q cavities. It is based on the
interaction via fractional adiabatic passage of a three-level atom traveling
through a cavity mode and a laser beam. The presence of optical phases is
emphasized.

  Scattering","4 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.090406",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a theoretical study of multi-mode scattering of light by optically
random media, using the Mueller-Stokes formalism which permits to encode all
the polarization properties of the scattering medium in a real $4 \times 4$
matrix. From this matrix two relevant parameters can be extracted: the
depolarizing power $D_M$ and the polarization entropy $E_M$ of the scattering
medium. By studying the relation between $E_M$ and $D_M$, we find that {\em
all} scattering media must satisfy some {\em universal} constraints. These
constraints apply to both classical and quantum scattering processes. The
results obtained here may be especially relevant for quantum communication
applications, where depolarization is synonymous with decoherence.

A 70, 052114 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.70.052114",,"quant-ph",,"  A system consisting of two neutral spin 1/2 particles is analyzed for two
magnetic field perturbations: 1) an inhomogeneous magnetic field over all
space, and 2) external fields over a half space containing only one of the
particles. The field is chosen to point from one particle to the other, which
results in essentially a one-dimensional problem. A number of interesting
features are revealed for the first case: the singlet, which has zero potential
energy in the unperturbed case, remains unstable in the perturbing field. The
spin zero component of the triplet evolves into a bound state with a double
well potential, with the possibility of tunneling. Superposition states can be
constructed which oscillate between entangled and unentangled states. For the
second case, we show that changes in the magnetic field around one particle
affect measurements of the spin of the entangled particle not in the magnetic
field nonlocally. By using protective measurements, we show it is possible in
principle to establish a nonlocal interaction using the two particles, provided
the dipole-dipole potential energy does not vanish and is comparable to the
potential energy of the particle in the external field.

and Fano factor, and of mixedness, quantified by quantum von Neumann and linear
entropies, of a pumped dissipative non-linear oscillator are studied. The model
can describe a signal mode interacting with a thermal reservoir in a
parametrically pumped cavity with a Kerr non-linearity. It is discussed that
the initial pure states, including coherent states, Fock states, and finite
superpositions of coherent states evolve into the same steady mixed state as
verified by the quantum relative entropy and the Bures metric. It is shown
analytically and verified numerically that the steady state can be well
approximated by a nonclassical Gaussian state exhibiting quadrature squeezing
and sub-Poissonian statistics for the cold thermal reservoir. A rapid increase
is found in the mixedness, especially for the initial Fock states and
superpositions of coherent states, during a very short time interval, and then
for longer evolution times a decrease in the mixedness to the same, for all the
initial states, and relatively low value of the nonclassical Gaussian state.
