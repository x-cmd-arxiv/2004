Final version published in ApJL","Astrophys.J. 613 (2004) L37","10.1086/425073",,"astro-ph",,"  Anisotropic gravitational radiation from a coalescing black hole binary can
impart a recoil velocity of up to several hundred km/s to the remnant black
hole. We examine the effects of recoiling massive black holes on their host
stellar bulges, both for holes that escape their host and those that return to
the galactic center via dynamical friction. We show that removal of a black
hole via radiation recoil generally results in a rapidly-formed central core in
the stellar system, with the effect being largest when the hole stays bound to
the bulge and the recoil velocity is comparable to the bulge velocity
dispersion. Black hole recoil therefore provides a mechanism for producing
cores in some early type galaxies, but it is expected to be most efficient in
faint ellipticals that are known to have steep density profiles. We argue that
these results may hint at a significant role for gas in facilitating the
coalescence of binary black holes in faint (power-law) early-type galaxies.

direct evidence that the nucleus of PN G 135.9+55.9 is a close binary. The

magnetic field parallel, never antiparallel, to its angular velocity. This and
several other experimental observations point to a special role of charge
asymmetry in superconductivity, which is the foundation of the theory of hole
superconductivity. The theory describes heavy dressed {\it positive} hole
carriers in the normal state that undress by pairing and become light undressed
{\it negative} electron carriers in the superconducting state.
Superconductivity is driven by kinetic energy lowering rather than by
electron-phonon coupling as in BCS. In quantum mechanics, kinetic energy
lowering is associated with $expansion$ of the electronic wave function, and
hence we predict: (1) Superconductors expel $negative$ charge from their
interior which consequently becomes $positively$ charged; (2) Macroscopic
electrostatic fields exist in the interior of superconductors always, and in
certain cases also outside near the surface; (3) Macroscopic spin currents
exist in the superconducting state; (4) Superconductors are 'rigid' with
respect to their response to applied longitudinal electric fields. These
predictions apply to all superconductors and are testable but are as yet
untested. The theory predicts highest $T_c$'s for materials for which normal
state transport occurs through $(positive)$ holes in $negatively$ charged
anions.

large density of states at the Fermi energy. The density of states is also
strongly enhanced for the (6,0) CNTs compared to the results obtained from the
zone-folding method. For the (5,5) CNTs the electron-phonon interaction is
dominated by the in-plane optical phonons, while for the ultrasmall (5,0) and
(6,0) CNTs the main coupling is to the out-of-plane optical phonon modes. We
calculate electron-phonon interaction strengths for all three types of CNTs and
analyze possible instabilities toward superconducting and charge-density wave
phases. For the smallest (5,0) nanotube, in the mean-field approximation and
neglecting Coulomb interactions, we find that the charge-density wave
transition temperature greatly exceeds the superconducting one. When we include
a realistic model of the Coulomb interaction we find that the charge-density
wave is suppressed to very low temperatures, making superconductivity dominant
with the mean-field transition temperature around one K. For the (6,0) nanotube
the charge-density wave dominates even with the inclusion of Coulomb
interactions and we find the mean-field transition temperature to be around
five Kelvin. We find that the larger radius (5,5) nanotube is stable against
superconducting and charge-density wave orders at all realistic temperatures.

like-charged rodlike polyelectrolytes, leading to the formation of
polelectrolyte bundles. In this paper, we calculate the equilibrium bundle size
using a simple model in which the attraction between polyelectrolytes (assumed
to be pairwise additive) is treated phenomenologically. If the counterions are
point-like, they almost completely neutralize the charge of the bundle, and the
equilibrium bundle size diverges. When the counterions are large, however,
steric and short-range electrostatic interactions prevent charge neutralization
of the bundle, thus forcing the equilibrium bundle size to be finite. We also
consider the possibility that increasing the number of nearest neighbors for
each rod in the bundle frustrates the attractive interaction between the rods.
Such a frustration leads to the formation of finite size bundles as well, even
when the counterions are small.

following. The internal deterministic Turing machines can do in $*$-polynomial
time what a classical deterministic Turing machine can do in an arbitrary

$*$-embedding of $HALT$), there is an internal deterministic Turing machine

${}^*Halt$ can not be decided by the internal deterministic Turing machines.
The internal deterministic Turing machines can be viewed as the asymptotic
behavior of finite precision approximation to real number computations. It is
possible to use the internal probabilistic Turing machines to simulate finite
state quantum mechanics with infinite precision. This simulation suggests that
no information can be transmitted instantaneously and at the same time, the
Turing machine model can simulate instantaneous collapse of the wave function.

three and more dimensions there are two kinds of solutions: a body similar to
the solution of classical Newton's problem and a union of two such bodies
``glued together'' by rear parts of their surfaces. In the two-dimensional case
there are solutions of five different types: (a) a trapezium; (b) an isosceles

not secure enough against brute-force attacks, and the third one means that an

keystream. Yet it remains to be clarified if intermittent chaos could be used
for designing secure chaotic cryptosystems.

network inevitably leads to its destabilization, such that a small perturbation
will be able to disrupt the entire system. One of the principal arguments
against this observation is that it is valid only for random networks, and
therefore does not apply to real-world networks, which presumably are
structured. Here we examine how the introduction of small-world topological
structure into networks affect their stability. Our results indicate that, in
structured networks, the parameter values at which the stability-instability
transition occurs with increasing complexity is identical to that predicted by
the May-Wigner criteria. However, the nature of the transition, as measured by
the finite-size scaling exponent, appears to change as the network topology
transforms from regular to random, with the small-world regime as the
cross-over region. This behavior is related to the localization of the largest
eigenvalues along the real axis in the eigenvalue plain with increasing
regularity in the network.

the corresponding one- and two-pion-exchange potentials. We apply these
considerations to a set of existing and prospective PV few-body measurements

the variation of the amino acid background distribution from one residue to the

The resulting dynamical model of independent replacements drawn from
heterogeneous backgrounds is simple and consistent, and provides a unified
