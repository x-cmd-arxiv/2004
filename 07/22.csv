have differed significantly from that of our own. Ancient clusters in M101, and
possibly in NGC 6946, appear to have luminosity distributions which continue to
rise to our detection limit (M_V ~ -6.0), well beyond the expected turnover
(M_V ~ -7.4) in the luminosity function. This is reminiscent of the situation
in M33, a Local Group galaxy of similar Hubble type. The faint ancient cluster
candidates in M101 and NGC 6946 have colors and radii similar to their more
luminous counterparts, and we suggest that these are either intermediate age

the faint, excess GC candidates are excluded, we find that the specific
frequency (S_N) of ancient clusters formed in later-type spirals is roughly
constant, with S_N=0.5 +- 0.2. By combining the results of this study with

become possible with the identification by GALEX of large numbers of sparsely

the ability to efficiently survey these sparse fields and directly measure the
Lyman continuum radiation that may leak into the low redshift (z < 0.4)

the new instrument with a simple long-slit observation of the starburst

that this low-z sub-DLA is a relatively primitive gas cloud. We consider the
nature and origin of the sub-DLA, and we find several possibilities. The
properties of the sub-DLA are similar to those of the interstellar media in
blue compact dwarf galaxies and are also reminiscent of Milky Way HVCs. Or, the
object could simply be a small dark-matter halo, self-enriched by a small
amount of internal star formation but mostly undisturbed since its initial
formation. In this case, the small halo would likely be an ancient building
block of galaxy formation that formed before the epoch of reionization.

calculations of accretion of Solar matter, at a variety of mass accretion
rates, onto hot ($2.3 \times 10^{5}$K), luminous (30L$_\odot$), massive
(1.25M$_\odot$, 1.35M$_\odot$) Carbon-Oxygen WDs. In contrast to our nova
simulations where the WD has a low initial luminosity and a thermonuclear
runaway (TNR) occurs and ejects material, these simulations do not eject
material (or only a small fraction of the accreted material) and the WD grows
in mass. A hydrogen TNR does not occur because hydrogen fuses to helium in the
surface layers, and we call this process Surface Hydrogen Burning (SHB). As the
helium layer grows in mass, it gradually fuses either to carbon and oxygen or
to more massive nuclei depending on the WD mass and mass accretion rate. If
such a WD were to explode in a SN Ia event, therefore, it would show neither
hydrogen nor helium in its spectrum as is observed. Moreover, the luminosities
and effective temperatures of our simulations agree with the observations of
some of the Super Soft X-ray Binary Sources and, therefore, our results
strengthen previous speculation that some of them (CAL 83 and CAL 87 for
example) are probably progenitors of SN Ia explosions. Finally, we have
achieved SHB for values of the mass accretion rate that almost span the
observed values of the Cataclysmic Variables.

to stars and very strong H2 emission lines. The luminosity ratios of H2
emission lines are suggestive of a thermal origin, and the equivalent width of
the H2 1-0 S(1) line is the second largest observed to date in an external
galaxy, after the well-studied strong H2-emitting galaxy NGC 6240. (2) The
infrared L-band spectrum shows a clear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission feature at 3.3 micron, which is usually found in star-forming
galaxies. The estimated star-formation luminosity from the observed PAH
emission can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosity. (3)
Millimeter interferometric observations of the nucleus reveal a high HCN (1-0)
to HCO+ (1-0) luminosity ratio of 1.8, as has been previously found in pure
AGNs. (4) The measurements of HCN (1-0) luminosity using a single-dish

light curves, excluding the brightness maxima, starting from the long
premaximum halt through the late decay phase of the outbursts using a
steady-state optically thick wind model. When the hydrogen-rich envelope of the
white dwarf (WD) is massive enough, the star expands to \sim 100 R_\sun or over
and its surface temperature decreases to below 7000 K. At this supergiant
mimicry stage, the changes in both the photospheric radius and the temperature
are small against the large increase in the envelope mass. These changes cause
a saturation in visual magnitude that lasts a long time before it begins to
decline. This saturation is known as the premaximum halt of a classical nova
outburst. The visual magnitude during the saturation is close to the bolometric
magnitude, which is an upper limit for a given WD mass. Since the WD masses are
estimated to be 0.59 M_\sun for V723 Cas and 1.1 M_\sun for V463 Sct by fitting
the decline rate of nova light curves, we can determine the absolute magnitude
of premaximum halts. It is a refined Eddington luminosity. Thus, the premaximum

interestingly a narrow emission Gaussian line at 5.4 keV (in its rest-frame),
most probably originating from a redshifted iron Kalpha line. No significant
line at or above 6.4 keV is found contrary to other objects showing redshifted
lines, ruling out a strong blue-wing to the line profile. The line is detected
at 99% confidence, from performing Monte Carlo simulations which fully account
for the range of energies where a narrow iron line is likely to occur. The
energy of the line could indicate emission from relativistic (0.17 - 0.23 c)
ejected matter moving away from the observer, as proposed for Mrk 766 by Turner
et al. (2004). Alternatively, the emission from a narrow annulus at the surface
of the accretion disk is unlikely due to the very small inclination angle (i.e.
less than 10 deg) required to explain the narrow, redshifted line in this
intermediate Seyfert galaxy. However emission from a small, localized hot-spot
on the disk, occurring within a fraction of a complete disk orbit, could also
explain the redshifted line. This scenario would be directly testable in a
longer observation, as one would see significant variations in the energy and
intensity of the line within an orbital timescale.

12CO emission towards intergalactic star forming regions located in the tidal
tail stemming from NGC7319, in the Stephan's Quintet compact group of galaxies.
The 13CO emission of the same region was observed with the IRAM 30m telescope
and optical spectroscopy of several HII regions in the area were obtained with
the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope. We recovered with the interferometer about 50%
of the CO(1-0) total emission that had been earlier measured with single dish
observations. We find two main areas of CO emission: (i) an elongated region
towards the area known as SQ B where a Tidal Dwarf Galaxy could currently be
forming (ii) a barely resolved area at the tip of the optical tidal arm. Both
regions follow dust lanes visible on HST images and their CO peak coincides
spatially exactly with the maximum of the Halpha line emission. In SQ B, there
is furthermore very good kinematical agreement between the CO, Halpha and HI
components. We conclude from these coincidences that the gaseous matter found
in quantities in the area is physically associated to the optical tidal tail
and thus that the intergalactic atomic hydrogen there was expelled from
NGC7319. Furthermore, the relatively high oxygen abundances (about solar)
estimated from the optical spectra of the HII regions imply that the gas
feeding the star formation originated from the inner regions of the parent
galaxy. In SQ B, we derive from different tracers a star formation rate of 0.5
\msun/yr. The inferred molecular gas consumption time of 0.5 Gyr lies in the
range of values found for spiral and starburst galaxies. On the other hand, the
ratio of 12CO/13CO>25 is much higher than the values found in disks of spiral
galaxies. A relatively low opacity for the 12CO gas is the most likely reason.

this hot flow with the cool disk extending outward from it. The fundamental
mode of (p-mode) oscillation is most easily excited, and has a frequency near
the Kepler frequency at the inner edge of the cool disk. The strongest
excitation mechanism is a feedback loop involving cooling of the ISAF by soft
photons from the cool disk and heating of the cool disk by the ISAF, while
synchrotron emission can be a relatively strong damping effect. Growth times
are computed by detailed Comptonization calculations of the interaction of an
idealized ISAF with a cool disk. Typical growth times as short as a few
dynamical times are found, while amplitudes can be as large as 10%.

a density of 10$^3$ cm^-3 and an incident far-ultraviolet field 10$^3$ times

continuum model with spatially correlated disorder potentials. The model can be
projected onto a couple of the lowest Landau bands. Levitation of the $n=0$
critical states is observed if at least the two lowest Landau bands are
considered. The dependence on the magnetic length $l_B=(\hbar/(eB))^{1/2}$ and
on the correlation length of the disorder potential $\eta$ is combined into a
single dimensionless parameter $\hat\eta=\eta/l_B$. This enables us to study
the behavior of the critical states for vanishing magnetic field. In the two
Landau band limit, we find a disorder dependent saturation of the critical
states' levitation which is in contrast to earlier propositions, but in accord
with some experiments.

to the coexistence of neutrinos of both types. As a consequence, each Dirac
neutrino testifies in favor of the existence of a kind of Majorana neutrino.
They constitute herewith the united families of massive neutrinos of a
different nature. Therefore, any of the earlier measured properties of

analyticity and discrete symmetries P, C, CP, TCP on the propagator (and on its
spectral function) are deduced. Its poles are the physical masses; this
unambiguously defines the propagating eigenstates. It is diagonalized and its
spectrum thoroughly investigated. The role of ``spurious'' states, of zero norm
at the poles, is emphasized, in particular for unitarity and for the
realization of TCP symmetry. The K_L-K_S mass splitting triggers a tiny
difference between their CP violating parameters \epsilon_L and \epsilon_S,
without any violation of TCP. A constant mass matrix like used in Quantum
Mechanics (QM) can only be introduced in a linear approximation to the inverse
propagator, which respects its analyticity and positivity properties; it is
however unable to faithfully describe all features of neutral mesons as we
determine them in QFT, nor to provide any sensible parameterization of eventual
effects of TCP violation. The suitable way to diagonalize the propagator makes
use of a bi-orthogonal basis; it is inequivalent to a bi-unitary transformation
(unless the propagator is normal, which cannot occur here). Problems linked
with the existence of different ``in'' and ``out'' eigenstates are smoothed
out. We study phenomenological consequences of the differences between the QFT
and QM treatments. The non-vanishing of semi-leptonic asymmetry \delta_S -
\delta_L does not signal, unlike usually claimed, TCP violation, while A_TCP
keeps vanishing when TCP is realized. We provide expressions invariant by the

allow the energy-momentum tensor of matter on the brane to have (step-like)
discontinuities, which are instead admitted in the four-dimensional General
Relativistic case, and compact sources must therefore have an atmosphere. Under
the simplifying assumption that matter is a spherically symmetric cloud of dust
without dissipation, we can find the conditions for which the collapsing star
generically ``evaporates'' and approaches the Hawking behavior as the
(apparent) horizon is being formed. Subsequently, the apparent horizon evolves
into the atmosphere and the back-reaction on the brane metric reduces the
evaporation, which continues until the effective energy of the star vanishes.
This occurs at a finite radius, and the star afterwards re-expands and
``anti-evaporates''. We clarify that the Israel junction conditions across the
brane (holographically related to the matter trace anomaly) and the projection
of the Weyl tensor on the brane (holographically interpreted as the quantum
back-reaction on the brane metric) contribute to the total energy as,
respectively, an ``anti-evaporation'' and an ``evaporation'' term. Concluding,
we comment on the possible effects of dissipation and obtain a new stringent
bound for the brane tension.

ubiquitous in nature. Mathematically, such motion is described by a PDE system
that couples the parabolic and hyperbolic phases, the latter inducing a loss of
regularity which has left the basic question of existence open until now.
  In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of such motions (locally
in time), when the elastic solid is the linear Kirchhoff elastic material. The
solution is found using a topological fixed-point theorem that requires the
analysis of a linear problem consisting of the coupling between the
time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations set in Lagrangian variables and the
linear equations of elastodynamics, for which we prove the existence of a
unique weak solution. We then establish the regularity of the weak solution;
this regularity is obtained in function spaces that scale in a hyperbolic
fashion in both the fluid and solid phases. Our functional framework is
optimal, and provides the a priori estimates necessary for us to employ our
fixed-point procedure.

the factors and z_j's. These vectors are called Bethe vectors.
  The question if the Bethe vectors are non-zero vectors is open. By the
moment, the only way to verify that was based on a relation to critical points
of the master function of the Gaudin model, and non-triviality of a Bethe
vector was proved only in the case when the corresponding critical point is
non-degenerate ([ScV], [MV1]). However degenerate critical points do appear in
the Gaudin model (see Section12 of [ReV]).
  We believe that the Bethe vectors never vanish, and suggest an approach that
does not depend on non-degeneracy of the corresponding critical point. The idea
is for a Bethe vector to choose a suitable subspace in the weight space and to
check that the projection of the Bethe vector to this subspace is non-zero. We
apply this approach to verify non-triviality of Bethe vectors in new examples.

skew-Hermitian versus unitary matrices ($n=1,2,...$), and a rational formal
power series is called \emph{matrix-$J$-unitary} in this case. The close
relationship between minimal realizations and structured Hermitian solutions
$H$ of the Lyapunov or Stein equations is established. The results are
specialized for the case of \emph{matrix-$J$-inner} rational formal power
series. In this case $H>0$, however the proof of that is more elaborated than
in the one-variable case and involves a new technique. For the rational
\emph{matrix-inner} case, i.e., when $J=I$, the theorem of Ball, Groenewald and
Malakorn on unitary realization of a formal power series from the
non-commutative Schur--Agler class admits an improvement: its
finite-dimensionality and uniqueness up to a unitary similarity is proved. A
version of the theory for \emph{matrix-selfadjoint} rational formal power
series is also presented. The concept of non-commutative formal reproducing
kernel Pontryagin spaces is introduced, and in this framework the backward
shift realization of a matrix-$J$-unitary rational formal power series in a
finite-dimensional non-commutative de Branges--Rovnyak space is described.

  - the L2-rho invariant of Cheeger-Gromov
  - the delocalized eta invariant of Lott for a finite conjugacy class of G.

delocalized invariant we only assume the validity of the Baum-Connes conjecture

are, for such groups, homotopy invariant. For the APS and the Cheeger-Gromov

involving the mass-squared differences for three-neutrino oscillations assuming
CP symmetry is conserved. For vacuum oscillation, we derive the expression for
the mixing angles that permit invariance under the interchange of two
mass-squared differences. This symmetry is most easily expressed in terms of an
ascending mass order. This can be used to reduce the parameter space by one
half in the absence of the MSW effect. For oscillations in matter, we derive
within our formalism the known approximate degeneracy between the standard and
inverted mass hierarchies in the limit of vanishing $\theta_{13}$. This is done
with a mass ordering that permits the map $\Delta_{31} \mapsto -\Delta_{31}$.
Our techniques allow us to translate mixing angles in this mass order
convention into their values for the ascending order convention. Using this
dictionary, we demonstrate that the vacuum symmetry and the approximate
symmetry invoked for oscillations in matter are distinctly different.

relativistic quantum mechanics, using a single-particle current. Their
comparison has shown large discrepancies. The comparison is extended here to
instant- and front-form calculations in unusual momentum configurations as well
as to a point-form approach inspired from the Dirac's one (based on a
hyperboloid surface). It is found that these new results depend on the momentum
transfer, Q, through its ratio to the total mass, Q/M, (closely related to the
Breit-frame velocity of the system). They evidence features similar for a part
to those shown by an earlier ``point-form'' implementation (based on
hyperplanes perpendicular to the velocity of the initial and final states). It
thus appears that the standard instant- and front-form calculations, which
generally do well compared either to experiment or to predictions of a
theoretical model, rather represent exceptional cases. An argument explaining
the success of these last approaches is presented and discussed. It is based on
transformations of currents under Poincar\'e space-time translations, going
beyond the energy-momentum conservation property which results from the
Lagrangian invariance under them. Depending on the approach, analytic or
approximate numerical methods are proposed to correct form factors for missing
constraints then expected.

prohibits exact copying of nonorthogonal states. Moreover, if we wish to copy

classical communication (LOCC), then further restrictions apply. We investigate
the problem of copying orthogonal, entangled quantum states with an entangled
blank state under the restriction to LOCC. Throughout, the subsystems have
finite dimension D. We show that if all of the states to be copied are
non-maximally entangled, then novel LOCC copying procedures based on
entanglement catalysis are possible. We then study in detail the LOCC copying
problem where both the blank state and at least one of the states to be copied
are maximally entangled. For this to be possible, we find that all the states
to be copied must be maximally entangled. We obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for LOCC copying under these conditions. For two orthogonal,
maximally entangled states, we provide the general solution to this condition.
We use it to show that for D=2,3, any pair of orthogonal, maximally entangled
states can be locally copied using a maximally entangled blank state. However,
we also show that for any D which is not prime, one can construct pairs of such
states for which this is impossible.
