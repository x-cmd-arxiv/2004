helioseismologically determined sound speed and density as a function of solar
radius, the depth of the convective zone, and the surface helium abundance, as
long as those models do not incorporate the most recent heavy element abundance
determinations. However, sophisticated new analyses of the solar atmosphere
infer lower abundances of the lighter metals (like C, N, O, Ne, and Ar) than
the previously widely used surface abundances. We show that solar models that
include the lower heavy element abundances disagree with the solar profiles of
sound speed and density as well as the depth of the convective zone and the
helium abundance. The disagreements for models with the new abundances range
from factors of several to many times the quoted uncertainties in the
helioseismological measurements. The disagreements are at temperatures below
what is required for solar interior fusion reactions and therefore do not
significantly affect solar neutrino emission. If errors in thecalculated OPAL
opacities are solely responsible for the disagreements, then the corrections in
the opacity must extend from 2 times 10^6 K (R = 0.7R_Sun)to 5 times 10^6 K (R
= 0.4 R_Sun), with opacity increases of order 10%.

projected direction of the local magnetic field. We re-examine this issue in
view of the numerous high angular resolution images of circumstellar disks and
micro-jets now available. The images show that T Tauri stars as a group are
oriented randomly with respect to the local magnetic field, contrary to
previous claims. This indicates that the magnetic field may play a lesser role
in the final stages of collapse of an individual prestellar core than
previously envisioned. The current database also suggests that a subsample of
CTTS with resolved disks but without observations of bright and extended
outflows have a tendency to align perpendicularly to the magnetic field. We
discuss the possibility that this may trace a less favorable topology, e.g.,
quadrupolar, for the magnetic field in the inner disk, resulting in a weaker
collimated outflow.

micro-quasar GRS 1915+105 performed in 2003. Out of a total of six times ~20
ks, we focus here only on the three observations during which GRS 1915+105 is
found in a steady C-state (referred to as class $\chi$) resulting in a total of
\~50 ks. During these observations, we detect low frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations with high (~14 %) rms amplitude in the 2-40 keV energy range.
Contrary to what is usually observed in GRS 1915+105, in most of our
observations the QPO frequency presents no correlation with the RXTE/PCA count
rate, nor with the RXTE/ASM count rate. We present, for the first time, high
resolution (22 spectral channels) 2-40 keV spectral fits of the energy
dependence of the QPO amplitude (``QPO spectra''). The QPO spectra are well
modeled with a cut-off power law except on one occasion where a single power
law gives a satisfactory fit (with no cut-off at least up to ~40 keV). The
cut-off energy evolves significantly from one observation to the other, from a
value of ~21.8 keV to ~30 keV in the other observations where it is detected.
We discuss the possible origin of this behavior and suggest that the compact
jet detected in the radio contributes to the hard X-ray (> 20 keV) mostly
through synchrotron emission, whereas the X-ray emitted below 20 keV would
originate through inverse Compton scattering. The dependence of the QPO
amplitude on the energy can be understood if the modulation of the X-ray flux
is contained in the Comptonized photons and not in the synchrotron ones.

(Gamma=2.00^{+0.03}_{-0.04}). A possible explanation for the higher fraction of
absorbed sources with radio emission at the muJy level is the presence of
circum-nuclear starburst activity that both feeds and obscures the central
engine. For a small sub-sample of z~0.4 radio emitting AGNs with N_H>1e22cm^-2
their combined spectrum exhibits a soft X-ray component that may be associated
with star-formation activity, although other possibilities cannot be excluded.

Green's functions to obtain equations for that part of the correlation which
does not lie in the null space of the matrix. In this paper, we show that this
procedure fails if the projector onto the null space is dependent on the

of the non-null space alone and we show that a solution is possible if one can
find a momentum-independent projector onto some subspace of the non-null space.
To do this, we enlist the aid of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
equation of motion matrix in order to project out the null space, thus reducing
the size of the matrix and eliminating the need for the anti-commutator Green's
function. We extend our previous work, dealing with a ferromagnetic Heisenberg
monolayer and a momentum-independent projector onto the null space, where both
multilayer films and a momentum-dependent projector are considered. We develop
the numerical methods capable of handling these cases and offer a computational

particles in the bulk for some of most popular brane models. Constraints have
been put on the parameter space of these models by calculating the time delay
due to propagation in the bulk of particles created during the interaction of
Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays with protons in the terrestrial atmosphere. The
question was however raised that probability of hard processes in which bulk
modes can be produced is small and consequently, the tiny flux of UHECRs can
not constrain brane models. Here we use Color Glass Condensate (CGC) model to
show that effects of extra dimensions are visible not only in hard processes
when the incoming particle hits a massive Kaluza-Klein mode but also through
the modification of soft/semi-hard parton distribution. At classical level, for
an observer in the CM frame of UHECR and atmospheric hadrons, color charge
sources are contracted to a thin sheet with a width inversely proportional to
the energy of the ultra energetic cosmic ray hadron and consequently they can
see an extra dimension with comparable size. Due to QCD interaction a short
life swarm of partons is produced in front of the sheet and its partons can
penetrate to the extra-dimension bulk. This reduces the effective density of
partons on the brane or in a classical view creates a delay in the arrival of
the most energetic particles if they are reflected back due to the warping of
the bulk. In CGC approximation the density of swarm at different distance from
the classical sheet can be related and therefore it is possible (at least
formally) to determine the relative fraction of partons in the bulk and on the
brane at different scales. Results of this work are also relevant to the test
of brane models in hadron colliders like LHC.

with the extension of the `gauge flip' formalism for the construction of gauge
invariant classes of Feynman diagrams to loop diagrams. In a nonlinear

possible for all neutral Higgs bosons, but not for the charged scalars.
Explicit examples of the equivalence theorem are discussed both in the minimal

is that after the `Feynman rules' for scalar diagrams are used, together with a
particular choice of the reference spinor, no further helicity-spinor algebra
is required to convert the results into a numerically usable form. Expressions
for all relevant individual diagrams are free of singularities at generic phase
space points, and amplitudes are manifestly Lorentz- (and gauge-) invariant. To
illustrate the method, we derive expressions for n-point amplitudes with three

representation theory, for example, modules over artin algebras, Cohen-Macaulay
modules over Cohen-Macaulay rings, lattices over orders, and coherent sheaves
on projective curves. In these Auslander-Reiten theories, the number `2' is
quite symbolic. For one thing, almost split sequences give minimal projective
resolutions of simple functors of projective dimension `2'. For another,
Cohen-Macaulay rings of Krull-dimension `2' provide us with one of the most
beautiful situation in representation theory, which is closely related to
McKay's observation on simple singularities. In this sense, usual
Auslander-Reiten theory should be `2-dimensional' theory, and it be natural to
find a setting for higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory from the
viewpoint of representation theory and non-commutative algebraic geometry.
  We introduce maximal $(n-1)$-orthogonal subcategories as a natural domain of
higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory which should be
`$(n+1)$-dimensional'. We show that the $n$-Auslander-Reiten translation
functor and the $n$-Auslander-Reiten duality can be defined quite naturally for
such categories. Using them, we show that our categories have {\it $n$-almost
split sequences}, which give minimal projective resolutions of simple objects
of projective dimension `$n+1$' in functor categories. We show that an
invariant subring (of Krull-dimension `$n+1$') corresponding to a finite

subcategory. We give a classification of all maximal 1-orthogonal subcategories

measurement operator in an infinite dimensional quantum system. Chaitin's
\Omega is defined as the probability that the universal self-delimiting Turing
machine U halts, and plays a central role in the development of algorithmic
information theory. In the theory, there are two equivalent ways to define the
program-size complexity H(s) of a given finite binary string s. In the standard
way, H(s) is defined as the length of the shortest input string for U to output
s. In the other way, the so-called universal probability m is introduced first,
and then H(s) is defined as -log_2 m(s) without reference to the concept of
program-size.
  Mathematically, the statistics of outcomes in a quantum measurement are
described by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) in the most general
setting. Based on the theory of computability structures on a Banach space
developed by Pour-El and Richards, we extend the universal probability to an
analogue of POVM in an infinite dimensional quantum system, called a universal
semi-POVM. We also give another characterization of Chaitin's \Omega numbers by
universal probabilities. Then, based on this characterization, we propose to
define an extension of \Omega as a sum of the POVM elements of a universal
semi-POVM. The validity of this definition is discussed.
  In what follows, we introduce an operator version \hat{H}(s) of H(s) in a
Hilbert space of infinite dimension using a universal semi-POVM, and study its
properties.

systems can be used for high efficiency transfer of quantum entanglement and
the generation of multi-particle entanglement over large distances and between
arbitrary sites without the requirement of precise spatial or temporal control.
The scheme is largely insensitive to disorder and random coupling strengths in
the chain. We discuss harmonic oscillator systems both in the case of arbitrary
Gaussian states and in situations when at most one excitation is in the system.
The latter case which we prove to be equivalent to an xy-spin chain may be used
to generate genuine multi particle entanglement. Such a 'quantum data bus' may
prove useful in future solid state architectures for quantum information
processing.

classical reversible circuit is addressed. A method based on quantum
information concepts is proposed. The method involves solely concepts from
quantum information - there is no need for an actual physical quantum computer.
The method is illustrated on the example of classical Shannon data compression.
