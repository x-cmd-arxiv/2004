There are several significant improvements over previous work. Firstly, a much
broader range of physically plausible spectral models was used. Secondly, we
have utilized a more rigorous statistical analysis. The standard F-distribution
was not employed, but rather the exact finite statistics F-distribution was
determined by Monte-Carlo simulations. This approach was motivated by the
recent work of Protassov et al. (2002) and Freeman et al. (1999). They
demonstrated that the standard F-distribution is not even asymptotically
correct when applied to assess the signficance of additional absorption
features in a spectrum. With our improved analysis we do not find a third and
fourth spectral feature (Bignami et al. (2003), De Luca et al. (2004)) in
1E1207.4-5209, but only the two broad absorption features previously reported
(Sanwal et al. (2002), Hailey and Mori (2002)). Two additional statistical
tests, one line model dependent and the other line model independent confirmed
our modified F-test analysis. For all physically plausible continuum models
where the weak residuals are strong enough to fit, the residuals occur at the
instrument Au-M edge. As a sanity check we confirmed that the residuals are
consistent in strength and position with the instrument Au-M residuals observed
in 3C273.

usual $\alpha$ effect caused by a hydrodynamic helicity. The nonhelical
$\alpha$ effect vanishes when the rotation is constant on the cylinders which
are parallel to the rotation axis. The mean differential rotation creates also
the shear-current effect which changes its sign with the nonlinear growth of
the mean magnetic field. However, there is no quenching of this effect. These
phenomena determine the nonlinear evolution of the mean magnetic field. An
effect of a uniform rotation on the nonlinear electromotive force is also

studied using the spectral $\tau$ approximation (the third-order closure

if turbulent heating is to balance radiative cooling in a quasi-steady state,
some mechanism must set the turbulent velocity to the required value. This
paper explores one possible regulating mechanism associated with an active
galactic nucleus at cluster center. A steady-state model for the intracluster
medium is presented in which radiative cooling is balanced by a combination of
turbulent heating and thermal conduction. The turbulence is generated by
convection driven by the buoyancy of cosmic rays produced by a central radio
source. The cosmic-ray luminosity is powered by the accretion of intracluster
plasma onto a central black hole. The model makes the rather extreme assumption
that the cosmic rays and thermal plasma are completely mixed. Although the
intracluster medium is convectively unstable near cluster center in the model
solutions, the specific entropy of the thermal plasma still increases outwards
because of the cosmic-ray modification to the stability criterion. The model
provides a self-consistent calculation of the turbulent velocity as a function
of position, but fails to reproduce the steep central density profiles observed
in clusters. The principal difficulty is that in order for the fully mixed
intracluster medium to become convectively unstable, the cosmic-ray pressure
must become comparable to or greater than the thermal pressure within the
convective region. The large cosmic-ray pressure gradient then provides much of
the support against gravity, reducing the thermal pressure gradient near
cluster center and decreasing the central plasma density gradient. A more
realistic AGN-feedback model of intracluster turbulence in which relativistic
and thermal plasmas are only partially mixed may have greater success.

using conventional dynamical methods, but can be determined using the technique
of reverberation mapping. However, it is important to verify that the results
of these different methods are equivalent. This can be done indirectly, using
scaling relations between the black hole and the host galaxy spheroid. For this
purpose, we have obtained new measurements of the bulge stellar velocity
dispersion, sigma, in Seyfert 1 galaxies. These are used in conjunction with
the M_bh -- sigma relation to validate nuclear black hole masses, M_bh, in
active galaxies determined through reverberation mapping. We find that Seyfert
galaxies follow the same M_bh -- sigma relation as non-active galaxies,
indicating that reverberation mapping measurements of M_bh are consistent with
those obtained using other methods. We also reconsider the relationship between
bulge absolute magnitude, M_bulge, and black hole mass. We find that Seyfert
galaxies are offset from non-active galaxies, but that the deviation can be
entirely understood as a difference in bulge luminosity, not black hole mass;
Seyfert hosts are brighter than normal galaxies for a given value of their
velocity dispersion, perhaps as a result of younger stellar populations.

always flows towards the poles. As a surprise, the radial heat-flux $F_r$ peaks
at the equator rather than at the poles (Taylor numbers O(10^6)). The same
behavior is observed for the radial turbulence intensity $<u_r^{\prime 2}>$
which for \emph{free} turbulence is also believed to peak at the poles (see Eq.
(19) below). As we can show, however, the consequences of this unexpected
result (also obtained by Kaepylae, Korpi and Tuominen 2004) for the theory of
differential rotation are small as mainly the $F_\theta$ is responsible to
solve the `Taylor number puzzle'. In all our simulations the azimuthal
component $F_\phi$ proves to be negative so that the rotating turbulence
produces an westwards directed azimuthal heat-flux which should be observable.
Fluctuations with higher temperature are expected to be anticorrelated with
their own angular velocity fluctuations. We find this rotation-induced result

under the influence of an axial magnetic field is considered. For sufficiently
large magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm the magnetorotational instability (MRI)
exists in a finite interval of magnetic field amplitudes, $B$_{min} < $B$ <
$B$_{max}. For Kepler disks the pure MRI needs both rather high Rm
(representing the needed electrical conductivity) as well as $B$_{min} of order
0.1 G. The magnetic field pattern resulting from our global and linear
calculations is of quadrupolar parity. For magnetic fields $antiparallel$ to
the rotation axis the Hall effect reduces the minimum magnetic Reynolds number
by about one order of magnitude. The $B$_{min}, however, is even (sightly)
increased (see Fig. 6). For magnetic fields $parallel$ to the rotation axis the
Hall effect drives its own instability without the action of the Lorentz force.
The corresponding critical magnetic Reynolds number proves to be larger with
Hall effect (Rm ~ 10) than without Hall effect (Rm ~ 7) so that the Hall effect
for parallel fields even disturbs the formation of MHD-instability in cool
protoplanetary disks. If the disk is supercritical then the main result of the
Hall effect for positive fields is the strong reduction of the minimum magnetic
field amplitude which is necessary to start the instability. Observations must
show whether in star-forming regions the rotation axis and the magnetic field
orientation are correlated or are anticorrelated. If the magnetic fields are
high enough then our model predicts the dominance of fields antiparallel to the

and supported by a chemical model which follows the transition of a
circumstellar envelope through the AGB phase and into the PPN phase of
evolution. The model includes the effects of UV radiation, cosmic rays and also
X-rays. Finally, the post-AGB ages of these two objects (200-400 yr) are

the Galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population in
the direction of CMa that cannot be explained by known Galactic components. By
analyzing the radial distribution of counts of M-giant stars in this direction,
we show that the Momany et al. (2004) warp model overestimates the number of
stars in the Northern hemisphere, hence hiding the CMa feature in the South.
The use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology of
the overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distance
of D=7.2\pm 0.3 kpc. To lend further support to the existence of a population
that does not belong to the Galactic disc, we present radial velocities of
M-giant stars in the centre of the CMa structure that were obtained with the
2dF spectrograph at the AAT. The extra population shows a radial velocity of
vr=109\pm4 km/s, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of the
disc at the distance of CMa. This population also has a low dispersion (13\pm4
km/s). The Canis Major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due to
the Galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing a
disrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. This leads to questions on what part
of CMa was previously identified as the Warp and how to possibly disentangle
the two structures.

of parameter-free predictions about stability of the disks, and their turbulent
transport properties, provided the disk structure is available. We discuss how
the latter can be deduced from interferometric observations of circumstellar
material. We use the resulting disk structure to compute the molecular
transport coefficients, including the effect of ionization by the central
object. The resulting control parameter indicates that the disk is well into
the turbulent regime. The analogy is also used to compute the effective
accretion rate, as a function of the disk characteristic parameters (orbiting
velocity, temperature and density). These values are in very good agreement
with experimental, parameter-free predictions derived from the analogy. The
turbulent viscosity is also computed and found to correspond to an
$\alpha$-parameter $2\times 10^{-4}<\alpha<2\times 10^{-2}$. Predictions
regarding fluctuations are also checked: luminosity fluctuations in disks do
obey the same universal distribution as energy fluctuations observed in a
laboratory turbulent flow. Radial velocity dispersion in the outer part of the
disk is predicted to be of the order of 0.1 km/s, in agreement with available
observations. All these issues provide a proof of the turbulent character of
the circumstellar disks, as well as a parameter-free theoretical estimate of
effective accretion rates.

We
show here how the plasma nature of the Sun leads to the self-generation of
solar activity. The release of magnetic, rotational, gravitational, nuclear
energies and that of the gravity mode oscillations deviate from uniformity and
spherical symmetry. Through instabilities they lead to the emergence of
sporadic and localized regions like flux tubes, electric filaments, magnetic
elements and high temperature regions. A systematic approach exploring the
solar collective degrees of freedom, extending to ordering phenomena of the
magnetic features related to Higgs fields, is presented. Handling solar
activity as transformations of energies from one form to another one presents a
picture on the network of the energy levels of the Sun, showing that the Sun is
neither a mere ""ball of gas"" nor a ""quiescent steady-state fusion-reactor
machine"", but a complex self-organizing system. Since complex self-organizing
systems are similar to living systems (and, by some opinion, identical with
them), we also consider what arguments indicate the living nature of the Sun.
Thermodynamic characteristics of the inequilibrium Sun are found important in
this respect and numerical estimations of free energy rate densities and
specific exergies are derived.

a two dimensional electron system (2DES) is an unexpected and surprising
phenomena. In these experiments the magnetoresistance of a high mobility 2DES
under the influence of microwave radiation of frequency $\omega$ at moderate
values of the magnetic field, exhibits strong oscillations with zero-resistance
states (ZRS) governed by the ratio $\omega /\omega_c$, where $\omega_c$ is the
cyclotron frequency. In this work we present a model for the photoconductivity
of a two dimensional electron system (2DES) subjected to a magnetic field. The
model includes the microwave and Landau contributions in a non-perturbative
exact way, impurity scattering effects are treated perturbatively. In our
model, the Landau-Floquet states act coherently with respect to the oscillating
field of the impurities, that in turn induces transitions between these levels.
Based on this formalism, we provide a Kubo-like formula that takes into account
the oscillatory Floquet structure of the problem. We study the effects of both
short-range and long-range disorder on the photoconductivity. Our calculation
yields a magnetoresistance oscillatory behavior with the correct period and
phase. It is found that, in agreement with experiment, negative dissipation can
only be induced in very high mobility samples. We analyze the dependence of the
results on the microwave power and polarization. For high-intensity radiation
multi-photon processes take place predicting new negative-resistance states
centered at $ \omega / \omega_c=1/2$, and $ \omega / \omega_c= 3/2$.

equations for the principal chiral SO(3)-field. In the defect-free case, the
geometric model reduces to elasticity theory for the displacement vector field
and to a principal chiral SO(3)-field model for the spin structure. As
illustrated by the example of a wedge dislocation, elasticity theory reproduces
only the linear approximation of the geometric theory of defects. It is shown
that the equations of asymmetric elasticity theory for the Cosserat media can
also be naturally incorporated into the geometric theory as the gauge
conditions. As an application of the theory, phonon scattering on a wedge
dislocation is considered. The energy spectrum of impurity in the field of a
wedge dislocation is also discussed.

distinctly superior quality. He-gas pressure was used to study the effect of
hydrostatic pressure on the different transport regimes for both variants. The
main results of these comparative investigations are (i) a significant part of
the inelastic-scattering contribution, which causes the anomalous rho(T)
maximum in standard HR crystals around 90 K, is sample dependent, i.e.
extrinsic in nature, (ii) the abrupt change in rho(T) at T* approx. 40 K from a
strongly temperature-dependent behavior at T > T* to an only weakly T-dependent
rho(T) at T < T* is unaffected by this scattering contribution and thus marks
an independent property, most likely a second-order phase transition, (iii)
both variants reveal a rho(T) proportional to AT^2 dependence at low
temperatures, i.e. for T_c < T < T_0, although with strongly sample-dependent
coefficients A and upper bounds for the T^2 behavior measured by T_0. The
latter result is inconsistent with the T^2 dependence originating from coherent

alternating sequence of positive and negative charges. This can be considered
as a model for a polyampholyte with intrinsic bending siffness and negligible
intramolecular interactions. We show how the finite intrinsic persistence
length affects the linear response to the external field.

equation is investigated. The Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method for banded
matrices with shift-invert was used to solve the linearised spectral stability
problem. The rarefaction solitary waves on the upper branch of the
Jones-Roberts dispersion curve are shown to be unstable to axisymmetric
infinitesimal perturbations, whereas the solitary waves on the lower branch and
all two-dimensional solitary waves are linearly stable. The growth rates of the
instabilities on the upper branch are so small that an arbitrarily specified
initial perturbation of a rarefaction wave at first usually evolves towards the
upper branch as it acoustically radiates away its excess energy. This is
demonstrated through numerical integrations of the GP equation starting from an
initial state consisting of an unstable rarefaction wave and random
non-axisymmetric noise. The resulting solution evolves towards, and remains for
a significant time in the vicinity of, an unperturbed unstable rarefaction
wave. It is shown however that, ultimately (or for an initial state extremely
close to the upper branch), the solution evolves onto the lower branch or is
completely dissipated as sound.

  Charge of that sign is confined to a narrow equatorial belt at latitudes $b

occupies most of the sphere's surface. The change in field structure is shown
to be a growing contribution of the `magic' electromagnetic field of the
charged Kerr-Newman black hole with Newton's G set to zero. The total charge
within the narrow equatorial belt grows as $(1-v^2/c^2)^{-{1/4}}$ and tends to
infinity as $v$ approaches $c$. The electromagnetic field, Poynting vector,
field angular momentum and field energy are calculated for these
configurations.
  Gyromagnetic ratio, g-factor and electromagnetic mass are illustrated in
terms of a 19th Century electron model. Classical models with no spin had the
small classical electron radius $e^2/mc^2\sim$ a hundredth of the Compton
wavelength, but models with spin take that larger size but are so

energy density of a field is maximal and gives an effective cut-off on

suffer from one cusp in the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F)$, which creates the problem

  self-consistent mean-field methods","122 pages, 41 figures, PhD thesis",,,"IFT preprint 19/2004","nucl-th",,"  Currently, one application of the mean-field methods in nuclear physics is
the investigation of exotic nuclear symmetries. This is related, in particular,
to the study of nuclear rotation about an axis tilted with respect to the
principal axes of the mass distribution in the Tilted-Axis Cranking (TAC)
model. The present work presents one of the first TAC calculations performed
within fully self-consistent methods. The Hartree-Fock method with the Skyrme
effective two-body interaction has been used. A computer code has been
developed that allows for the breaking of all spatial symmetries of the
solution. As a first application, calculations for the magnetic bands in 142Gd
and for the chiral bands in 130Cs, 132La, 134Pr, and 136Pm have been carried
out. The appearance of those bands is due to a new mechanism of breaking the
spherical symmetry and to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry,
respectively. The self-consistent solutions for 142Gd confirm the important
role of the shears mechanism in generating the total angular momentum. However,
the agreement with experimental data is not satisfactory, probably due to the
lack of the pairing correlations in the calculations or to the possibly
overestimated deformation. The results obtained for 132La constitute the first
fully self-consistent proof that the nuclear rotation can attain a chiral
character. It has been shown that the chiral rotation can only exist above a
certain critical angular frequency. It has also been checked that the terms of
the Skyrme mean field odd under the time reversal have no qualitative influence
on the results.

The resulting Kohn-Sham orbitals reproduce the many-body densities very
accurately, and furthermore we have demonstrated that the negative of the
energy eigenvalue of the outermost electron orbital agrees with the
corresponding ionization energy with extreme accuracy. The procedure is also
applied to the Hartree-Fock density of the $1s2s ^{3}S$ state, and the
Kohn-Sham eigenvalue of the $2s$ orbital is found to agree very well with the
corresponding Hartree-Fock eigenvalue, which is the negative of the ionization
energy in this model due to Koopmans' theorem. The results for the $1s2s ^{3}S$
state clearly demonstrate that there is no conflict between the locality of the
Kohn-Sham potential and the exclusion principle, as claimed by Nesbet (Phys.

turbulence and their influence on the turbulent spectra is considered. We have
developed the analog of the vortex line representation as a transformation to
the curvilinear system of coordinates moving together with the di-vorticity
lines. Compressibility of this mapping can be considered as the main reason for
the formation of the vorticity discontinuities at high Reynolds numbers. For
two-dimensional turbulence in the case of strong anisotropy the vorticity
discontinuities can generate spectra with the fall-off at large $k$
proportional to $k^{-3}$ resembling the Kraichnan spectrum for the enstrophy
cascade. For turbulence with weak anisotropy the $k$ dependence of the spectrum
due to discontinuities coincides with that of the Saffman spectrum: $k^{-4}$.
We have compared the analytical predictions with direct numerical solutions of
the two-dimensional Euler equation for decaying turbulence. We observe that the
di-vorticity is reaching very high values and is distributed locally in space
along piecewise straight lines. Thus, indicating strong anisotropy and
accordingly we found a spectrum close to the $k^{-3}$-spectrum.

This approach is applicable to pulses of arbitrary (nonrelativistic) strengths,

different problems from the field of light--matter interaction. Very good
quality of the method is shown by recovering with it a number of subtle effects
met in earlier numerically calculated photon-emission spectra from model
molecular ions, double quantum wells, atoms and semiconductors. The method
presented is an efficient mathematical tool to describe novel effects in the
