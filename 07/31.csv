from $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution Advanced Camera for Surveys
imaging data. Our analysis covers an area of $48\Box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ the
area of the HDF-N) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($I\sim24$ mag) than was
possible in the Deep Groth Strip Survey (DGSS). At $0.5<z<0.75$, we find
$M_B^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at
$0.75<z<1.0$, we find $M_B^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. These luminosity
functions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosity
function using morphological selection (e.g., DGSS), but are much steeper than
the luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies like
the color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., CFRS, CADIS, or COMBO-17). The
difference is due to the `blue', $(U-V)_0<1.7$, E/S0 galaxies, which make up to
$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faint
galaxies. We thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological and
structural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.
  We find that the `blue' E/S0 galaxies have the same average sizes and Sersic
parameters as the `red', $(U-V)_0>1.7$, E/S0 galaxies at brighter luminosities
($M_B<-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where
`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower Sersic parameters. Fits of the
colors to stellar population models suggest that most E/S0 galaxies have short
star-formation time scales ($\tau<1$ Gyr), and that galaxies have formed at an
increasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been a
gradual decline.

detectors with high efficiency in the full 0.5-70keV range. Building on the

constraints imposed by cosmic microwave background experiments in a Lambda-CDM

observations by WMAP, ACBAR, CBI and VSA can provide one of the most precise
techniques available to measure cosmological parameters. For a minimal flat
six-parameter Lambda-CDM model with an HOD with three free parameters, we find
Omega_m=0.278^{+0.027}_{-0.027}, sigma_8=0.812^{+0.028}_{-0.027}, and
H_0=69.8^{+2.6}_{-2.6}km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}; these errors are significantly
smaller than from CMB alone and similar to those obtained by combining CMB with
the large-scale galaxy power spectrum assuming scale-independent bias. The
corresponding HOD parameters describing the minimum halo mass and the
normalization and cut-off of the satellite mean occupation are
M_min=(3.03^{+0.36}_{-0.36})x 10^{12} h^{-1} M_sun, M_1 =
(4.58^{+0.60}_{-0.60})x 10^{13} h^{-1} M_sun, and kappa=4.44^{+0.51}_{-0.69}.
When more parameters are added to the HOD model, the error bars on the HOD
parameters increase because of degeneracies, but the error bars on the
cosmological parameters do not increase greatly. Similar modeling for other
galaxy samples could reduce the statistical errors on these results, while more
thorough investigations of the cosmology dependence of nonlinear halo bias and
halo mass functions are needed to eliminate remaining systematic uncertainties,
which may be comparable to statistical uncertainties.

There are only 5 accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsars known among more
than 80 LMXBs containing neutron stars, but there are another 11 ""nuclear
powered"" millisecond pulsars which reveal their spin only during brief,
thermonuclear X-ray bursts. In addition, 2 of the accretion-powered pulsars
also exhibit X-ray burst oscillations, and their unusual properties, along with
the absence of persistent pulsations in most LMXBs, suggest that the magnetic
fields in many LMXBs may be hidden by accreted material. Interestingly, the
nuclear-powered pulsars offer a statistically unbiased probe of the spin
distribution of recycled pulsars and show that this distribution cuts off
sharply above 730 Hz, well below the breakup spin rate for most neutron star
equations of state. This indicates that some mechanism acts to halt or balance
spin-up due to accretion and that submillisecond pulsars must be very rare (and
are possibly nonexistent). It is unclear what provides the necessary angular
momentum sink, although gravitational radiation is an attractive possibility.

a strong suppression of non-nuclear recoil backgrounds. Using this information
to define an acceptance region for nuclear recoils we have 16 events from the

pulses (GPs) from the pulsar PSR B0031-07 at 40 and 111 MHz. At 40 MHz the peak
flux density of the strongest pulse is 1100 Jy, which is 400 times as high as
the peak flux density of the average pulse (AP). Peak flux density of the GPs
compared to the AP peak flux density has roughly a power-law distribution with
a slope of -4.5. GPs at 40 MHz are essentially stronger than those ones at 111
MHz. This excess is approximately in inverse proportion to the frequency ratio.
The giant pulses are much narrower than the AP, and cluster in two narrow
regions of the AP near the peaks of the two components of the AP. Some of the
GPs emit at both phases and are double. The separation of the double GP
emission regions depends on frequency. Similarly to the frequency dependence of
the width of the AP, it is less at 111 MHz than at 40 MHz. This suggests that
GPs are emitted from the same region of the magnetosphere as the AP, that is in
a hollow cone over the polar cap instead of the light cylinder region. PSR
B0031-07 as well as the previously detected PSR B1112+50 are the first pulsars
with GPs that do not have a high magnetic field at the light cylinder. One may
suggest that there are two classes of GPs, one associated with high-energy
emission from outer gaps, the other associated with polar radio emission. The
GPs of PSR B0031-07 and PSR B1112+50 are of the second class. The dispersion
measure DM is found to be 10.900 +/- 0.003 pc/cm^{3}.

cells. Relying on the exact mapping between the hard-core limit of the boson
Hamiltonian and the model of spinless noninteracting fermions, incompressible
insulator domains are shown to exist for rational fillings that are predicted
to be compressible in the atomic limit. The corresponding boundaries,
qualitatively described in a {\it multiple-site} mean-field approach, are shown
to exhibit an unusual loophole shape. A more quantitative description of the
loophole domain boundaries at half filling for the special case $\ell$ = 2 is
supplied in terms of analytic strong-coupling expansions and quantum Monte
Carlo simulations.

system subject to an in-plane magnetic field is calculated within the framework
of conventional Fermi liquid theory applied to actually a three-dimensional
system of spinless electrons confined to a highly anisotropic (planar)
near-surface potential well. Using the calculation method suggested in this
paper, the magnetic field piercing a finite range of infinitely long system of
carriers is treated as introducing the additional highly non-local scatterer
which separates the circuit thus modelled into three parts -- the system as
such and two perfect leads. The transverse quantization spectrum of the inner
part of the electron waveguide thus constructed can be effectively tuned by
means of the magnetic field, even though the least transverse dimension of the
waveguide is small compared to the magnetic length. The initially finite
(metallic) value of the conductance, which is attributed to the existence of
extended modes of the transverse quantization, decreases rapidly as the
magnetic field grows. This decrease is due to the mode number reduction effect
produced by the magnetic field. The closing of the last current-carrying mode,
which is slightly sensitive to the disorder level, is suggested as the origin
of the magnetic-field-driven metal-to-insulator transition widely observed in
2D systems.

Specifically, for x=0.5, T_N is observed at 3 K with a subsequent onset of

T_N is found to be the highest (4.0 K). Detailed analysis of the measured

follows a T^3 variation below T_c, the latter property indicating

structure of our equations the results for magnetic moments of quarks and their
densities depend on two additional parameters. Using information from deep
inelastic scattering and baryon $\beta$-decays we discuss the dependence of
antiquark polarizations on introduced parameters. For some plausible values of
these parameters we show that these polarizations are small if we neglect
angular momenta of quarks. Our very good fit to magnetic moments of baryon
octet can still be improved by using specific model for angular momentum of
quarks.

both the hierarchy and charge universality problems. We first critique the
rationale for hierarchy solution and 4D effective interactions in the
Randall-Sundrum model. We note its asymmetric treatment of matter and gravity
in the warped braneworld background, leaving uncalibrated the particle scale;
as well as its unconventional spatial attribution of integrated 4D effective
gravity. Matter and massless gravitons both localize when branes form to warp
spacetime; thus consistent accounting of induced 4D physics must track both
particle and Planck scales through brane formation. We perform such
self-consistent tracking in the warped Randall-Sundrum background, by treating
matter as intrinsically extradimensional, on par with gravity, with a unified
mass scale. We find this definite, self-consistent theory solves two major
problems: the effective 4D theory shows robust hierarchy solution, and
preserves charge universality. Our unified 5D field theory lies at the Planck
scale; it induces an integrated 4D effective field theory with universal
charges, Planck scale 4D gravity, and TeV scale matter. However, this effective
field theory describes, not 4D physics on a specific brane, but 4D physics
induced by an unobservably small (12 M_{Pl}^{-1}) warped extra dimension. This
unified approach validates Randall-Sundrum hierarchy solution, while
exemplifying a field theory whose dimensional reduction preserves charge
universality.

the symmetry algebra and structural properties of Feynman diagrams we are able
to bypass involved, higher-loop field theory computations. In this way we
obtain the complete one-loop dilatation operator and the planar, three-loop

issue of integrability within a planar four-dimensional gauge theory: We prove
that the complete dilatation generator is integrable at one-loop and present
the corresponding Bethe ansatz. We furthermore argue that integrability extends
to three-loops and beyond. Assuming that it holds indeed, we finally construct
a novel spin chain model at five-loops and propose a Bethe ansatz which might
be valid at arbitrary loop-order!

concentrate on the U(N) singlet sector of these models. In the particular case
of quadratic matrix potential, the singlet sector can be mapped by a similarity
transformation onto the two-dimensional Calogero-Marchioro-Sutherland model at
specific couplings. For this quadratic case we were able to solve the $N-$body
Schr\""odinger equation and obtain infinite sets of singlet eigenstates of the
matrix model with given total angular momentum. Our main object in this paper
is to study the singlet sector in the collective field formalism, in the
large-N limit. We obtain in this framework the ground state eigenvalue
distribution and ground state energy for an arbitrary potential, and outline
briefly the way to compute bona-fide quantum phase transitions in this class of
models. As explicit examples, we analyze the models with quadratic and quartic
potentials. In the quartic case, we also touch upon the disk-annulus quantum
phase transition. In order to make our presentation self-contained, we also
discuss, in a manner which is somewhat complementary to standard expositions,
the theory of point canonical transformations in quantum mechanics for systems
whose configuration space is endowed with non-euclidean metric, which is the

proof in the context of non-relativistic QED. This paper contains one part of
such a proof by giving a lower bound to the free energy which is proportional
to the number of particles and which takes account of the fact that the field,
unlike the particles, is never confined to a finite volume. In the earlier
proof the lower bound was a `two line' corollary of the `stability of matter'.

parallel result in the framework of adelic harmonic analysis which we dub the
adelic Stirling formula, (ii) proving the conjecture in the genus zero case and
(iii) explaining in detail how to deduce St(K/k,S) from our conjecture. In the

genetic switch composed of two mutually repressing/activating genes. The
protein and DNA state dynamics are treated stochastically and on equal footing.
In this approach the mean influence of the proteomic cloud created by one gene
on the action of another is self-consistently computed. Within this
approximation a broad range of stochastic genetic switches may be solved
exactly in terms of finding the probability distribution and its moments. A
much larger class of problems, such as genetic networks and cascades also
remain exactly solvable with this approximation. We discuss in depth certain
specific types of basic switches, which are used by biological systems and
compare their behavior to the expectation for a deterministic switch.

  Pages 469-481","10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.10.019",,"q-bio.CB",,"  Experimental evidence indicates that human brain cancer cells proliferate or
migrate, yet do not display both phenotypes at the same time. Here, we present
a novel computational model simulating this cellular decision-process leading
up to either phenotype based on a molecular interaction network of genes and
proteins. The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), its ligand transforming growth factor-a (TGFa), the
downstream enzyme phospholipaseC-gamma (PLCg) and a mitosis-associated response
pathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGFa secretion, and the
EGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers, as well as modulated by
an extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action
kinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment, we analyze both the
emergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell molecular
profiles that change over time and space. Our results show that one can indeed
simulate the dichotomy between cell migration and proliferation based solely on
an EGFR decision network. It turns out that these behavioral decisions on the
single cell level impact the spatial dynamics of the entire cancerous system.
Furthermore, the simulation results yield intriguing experimentally testable
hypotheses also on the sub-cellular level such as spatial cytosolic
polarization of PLCg towards an extrinsic chemotactic gradient. Implications of
these results for future works, both on the modeling and experimental side are
discussed.

pointed out. The relation of the OFS with quantum measurement theory is also

states (GCS) for some groups (SU(2), SU(1,1) and SU(N)) is considered and it is
shown that one and the same classical solution z(t) can correctly characterize
the quantum evolution of many different (in general nonequivalent) systems. As
examples some concrete systems are treated in greater detail: it is obtained
that the nonstationary systems of the singular oscillator, of the particle
motion in a magnetic field, and of the oscillator with friction all have stable
SU(1,1) GCS whose quantum evolution is determined by one and the same classical
function z(t). The physical properties of the constructed SU(1,1) GCS are
discussed and it is shown particularly that in the case of discrete series
D_k^+ they are those states for which the quantum mean values coincide with the
statistical ones for an oscillator in a thermostat.
