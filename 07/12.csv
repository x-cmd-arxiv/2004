KAOS etc...}) is a key problem given our ignorance of the physics underlying
cosmic acceleration and the plethora of surveys planned. We propose a Bayesian
design framework which (1) maximises the discrimination power of a survey
without assuming any underlying dark energy model, (2) finds the best niche
survey geometry given current data and future competing experiments, (3)
maximises the cross-section for serendipitous discoveries and (4) can be
adapted to answer specific questions (such as `is dark energy dynamical?').
Integrated Parameter Space Optimisation (IPSO) is a design framework that
integrates projected parameter errors over an entire dark energy parameter
space and then extremises a figure of merit (such as Shannon entropy gain which
we show is stable to off-diagonal covariance matrix perturbations) as a
function of survey parameters using analytical, grid or MCMC techniques. We
discuss examples where the optimisation can be performed analytically. IPSO is
thus a general, model-independent and scalable framework that allows us to
appropriately use prior information to design the best possible surveys.

present work we determine stellar kinematics for a sample of 124 disk stars,

from the the literature. Our stars form a subsample of the Edvardsson et al.
(1993) sample and we concentrate on three main tracers: (i) Europium as an
r-process element is predominantly produced in Supernovae of type II. (ii)
Likewise, alpha-elements, such as Ca, Si, Mg, are synthesised in SNe II,
contrary to iron, which is being produced preferentially in SNe Ia. (iii) The
s-process element Barium is a measure of the relative contribution of AGB stars
to the Galaxy's enrichment history and has been shown to be an indicator for
distinguishing between thin and thick disk stars. All such studies reveal,
basically, that stars with low galactocentric rotational velocity tend to have
high abundances of alpha-elements and Eu, but lower abundances of, e.g., Ba.

spectroscopic CO index. A clear anti-correlation between the observed CO index
and the nuclear K-L color is present, suggesting that a featureless hot dust
continuum heated by an AGN contributes significantly to the observed K-band
fluxes in the nuclei of Seyfert 2 galaxies. After correction for this AGN
contribution, we estimate nuclear stellar K-band luminosities for all sources,
and CO indices for sources with modestly large observed CO indices. The
corrected CO indices for 10 (=40%) Seyfert 2 nuclei are found to be as high as
those observed in star-forming or elliptical (=spheroidal) galaxies. We combine
the K-band data with measurements of the L-band 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic

star-formation, and find that the 3.3 micron PAH to K-band stellar luminosity
ratios are substantially smaller than those of starburst galaxies. Our results
suggest that the 3.3 micron PAH emission originates in the putative nuclear
starbursts in the dusty tori surrounding the AGNs, because of its high surface
brightness, whereas the K-band CO absorption features detected at the nuclei
are dominated by old bulge (=spheroid) stars, and thus may not be a powerful

  Combining our data with the recently published meaurements of the SN Ia rate

The increase for a look back time of ""only"" 2.8 Gyr is more rapid than

Core-collapse SN rates measure the death rate of massive star and, because of
the short time scale of evolution, can be translated in a measurement of the

core-collapse progenitors we derived to an estimate of the star formation rate

This system is often used to estimate basic stellar population parameters such
as luminosity weighted ages and metallicities. Using single stellar population
model spectral energy distributions by Vazdekis (1999) we find that the LOSVD
corrections are largely insensitive to changes in the stellar populations for
old galaxies (age >3 Gyr). Only the Lick/IDS Balmer series indices show an
appreciable effect, which is on the order of the correction itself.
Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the LOSVD corrections to
non-Gaussian LOSVDs. In this case the LOSVD can be described by a Gauss-Hermite
series and it is shown that typical values of h_3 and h_4 observed in
early-type galaxies can lead to significant modifications of the LOSVD
corrections and thus to changes in the derived luminosity weighted ages and
metallicities. A new, simple parameterisation for the LOSVD corrections, taking
into account the h_3 and h_4 terms, is proposed and calibrations given for a
subset of the Lick/IDS indices and two additional indices applicable to old (>3
Gyr) stellar populations.

an LVG radiative transfer model to determine physical conditions of the

all CO transitions up to 12CO(15-14). A PDR model has also been used and here
the data are well fitted (within 20 %) by a model cloud with a gas density of

higher than suggested by broadband groundbased UBVRI photometry. Using our
ESO/VLT/FORS1 spectral observations and HST/WFPC2 archival images we show that
the old HST and new VLT spectral data are >50% contaminated by the Pulsar Wind
Nebula (PWN) and that this is the reason for the above mentioned difference. We
find that the broadband HST spectrum for the range 3300-8000 A is clearly non-
thermal and has a negative spectral index of 1.07(+0.20/-0.19). This is dif-
ferent from the almost flat spectrum of the Crab pulsar. The PWN of B0540 shows
a clear asymmetry of the surface brightness distribution along the major axis
of the PWN torus-like structure with respect to the pulsar position, also seen
in Chandra X-ray images. This can be linked to the asymmetry of the surrounding
SN ejecta. We find no significant spectral index variation over the PWN. Using
HST archival images we estimate the proper motion of B0540 to be 4.9+/-2.3
mas/yr, i.e. a transverse velocity of 1190+/-560 km/s along the southern jet of
the PWN. This can make PSR B0540 the third pulsar with a proper motion aligned

cooling to low temperatures of T<10^4 K in cooling flow clusters, directly
gains energy from the central black hole. Most of the cool gas is accelerated
to non-relativistic high velocities, v ~ 10^3-10^4 km/sec, after flowing
through, or close to, an accretion disk around the central black hole. A poorly
collimated wind (or double not-well collimated opposite jets) is formed.
According to the proposed scenario, this gas inflates some of the X-ray
deficient bubbles, such that the average gas temperature inside these bubbles
(cavities) in cooling flow clusters is kT_b ~< 100 keV. A large fraction of
these bubbles will be very faint, or not detectable, in the radio. The bright
rims of these weak smaller bubbles will appear as ripples. We suggest that the
X-ray ripples observed in the Perseus cluster, for example, are not sound
waves, but rather the rims of radio-faint weak bubbles which are only slightly
hotter than their environment. This scenario is incorporated into the moderate
cooling flow model; although not a necessary ingredient in that model, it
brings it to better agreement with observations. In the moderate cooling flow
model a cooling flow does exist, but the mass cooling rate is ~<10% of that in
old versions of cooling flow models.

central star's emission-line spectrum yields He:C:O mass fractions of
0.36:0.48:0.16, similar to those of PG1159 stars. A detailed empirical analysis
of the nebular collisionally excited line (CEL) and optical recombination line
(ORL) spectrum is presented, together with fully three-dimensional
photoionisation modelling of the nebula. We found very large ORL-CEL abundance
discrepancy factors (ADFs) for O^2+ (32) and Ne^2+ (33). The mean value of
5100K for the T_e derived from HeI recombination lines ratios is 6000K lower
than the value of 11100K implied by the [OIII] line ratio.
  A three-dimensional photoionisation model of NGC 1501 was constructed using
the photoionisation code MOCASSIN, based on our new spectroscopic data and
using the three-dimensional electron density distribution determined from
long-slit echellograms of the nebula by Ragazzoni et al. (2001). The initial
models showed higher degrees of ionisation of heavy elements than indicated by
observations. We investigated the importance of the missing low-temperature
dielectronic recombination rates for third-row elements and have estimated
upper limits to their rate coefficients.
  Our model heavily under-predicts the optical recombination line emission. We
conclude that the presence of a hydrogen-deficient, metal-rich component is
necessary to explain the observed ORL spectrum of this object. The existence of
such knots could also provide a softening of the radiation field, via the
removal of ionising photons by absorption in the knots, thereby helping to
alleviate the over-ionisation of the heavy elements in our models.

density measurements from line fluxes of X-ray lines measured for a large
sample of 64 grating spectra of 42 stellar coronae obtained with Chandra and
XMM-Newton. Line counts of strong H-like and He-like ions and FeXXI lines were
measured with the CORA line fitting tool by Ness and Wichmann 2002. Densities
are estimated from He-like f/i flux ratios of OVII and NeIX representing only
cooler (1-6MK) plasma components. The densities scatter between log n_e =
9.5-11 from the OVII triplet and between log n_e = 10.5-12 from the NeIX
triplet, but we caution that the latter triplet may be biased by contamination
from FeXIX and FeXXI lines. We find that low-activity stars tend to show
densities of no more than a few times 10^10cm^-3, whereas no definitive trend
is found for the more active stars. Investigating the densities of the hotter
plasma with various FeXXI line ratios, we found no consistent proof for the
presence of very high densities. This result is in line with constant pressure
in the emitting active regions. We focus on the commonly used RTV78 scaling law
to derive loop lengths from temperatures and densities assuming loop-like
structures as identical building blocks. We derive emitting volumes from direct
measurements of ion-specific emission measures and densities. Available volumes
are calculated from the loop-lengths and stellar radii. The ratios of these
volumes depict volume filling factors, which we find similar up to 0.1 for all
stages of activity for OVII and increasing for NeIX.

thermal equilibrium (glassy behavior), which deteriorate the efficiency of the
Monte Carlo sampling. We employ the transfer-matrix (TM) method, implementing
Novotny's idea, which enables us to treat arbitrary number of spins $N$ for one

finite-size-scaling analyses. Accepting the extended parameter space by Cirillo

multi-critical (crossover) scaling theory. That is, the previously reported
nonstandard criticality for the gonihedric model is reconciled with a crossover
exponent and the ordinary three-dimensional-Ising universality class. We
estimate the crossover exponent and the correlation-length critical exponent at

this paper, we revisit this question via the explicit studies of the following
1D models (i) a particle in 1D random potentials (ii) the random field Ising
chain with continuous disorder distribution. In both cases, we define precisely
the `two-level' excitations and their statistical properties, and we show that
their contributions to various observables are in full agreement at low
temperature with the the rigorous results obtained independently. The
statistical properties of these two-level excitations moreover yield simple
identities at order $T$ in temperature for some generating functions of thermal
cumulants. For the random-field Ising chain, in the regime where the Imry-Ma
length is large, we obtain that the specific heat is dominated by small
non-universal excitations, that depend on the details of the disorder
distribution, whereas the magnetic susceptibility and the Edwards-Anderson
order parameter are dominated by universal large excitations, whose statistical
properties only depend on the variance of the initial disorder via the Imry-Ma
length.

vortices in long Josephson junctions at zero dc magnetic field. Our intriguing
observation is that applying an ac-bias of a small frequency $f \ll f_p $ and
sufficiently large amplitude changes the current-voltage characteristics
($I$-$V$ curve) of the junction in a way similar to the effect of dc magnetic
field, well known as the flux-flow behavior. The characteristic voltage $V$ of
this low voltage branch increases with the power $P$ of microwave radiation as
$V_{s}\propto P^{\alpha}$ with the index $\alpha \simeq 0.5 $. Experiments
using a low-temperature laser scanning microscope unambiguously indicate the
motion of Josephson vortices driven by microwaves. Numerical simulations agree
with the experimental data and show strongly {\it irregular} vortex motion. We
explain our results by exploiting an analogy between the microwave-induced
vortex flow in long Josephson junctions and incoherent multi-photon absorption
in small Josephson junctions in the presence of large thermal fluctuations. In
the case of long Josephson junctions the spatially-temporal chaos in the vortex
motion mimics the thermal fluctuations. In accordance with this analogy, a
control of the intensity of chaos in a long junction by changing its damping
constant leads to a pronounced change in the shape of the $I$-$V$ curve. Our
results provide a possible explanation to previously measured but not yet
understood microwave-driven properties of intrinsic Josephson junctions in
high-temperature superconductors.

predict that with increasing temperature the frequency dependence of the noise

because of potential applications, mainly in spintronic devices. A necessary
condition for the existence of these spin splittings is the absence of

broken, giving rise to a small spin splitting. The much larger spin splitting
observed in quantum wells is normally attributed to the asymmetry of the
confining potential and explained on the basis of the Rashba effect. For
symmetrically confined wells, where the only source of asymmetry is that of the
underlying crystal potential, the confining potential strongly enhances the
spin splittings. This enhancement does not require the asymmetry of the
confining potential but depends on the interplay between the confinement and
the crystal potential. In this situation the behavior of the spin splittings is
consistent with the Dresselhaus contribution.
  In asymmetrically confined wells both Dresselhaus and Rashba terms

optimized the demagnetized state is with respect to the best-possible ground
state. Exact results for the energy in d=1 show that in a paramagnet, with
finite spin-spin correlations, there is a significant difference in the
energies if the disorder is not so strong that the states are trivially almost
alike. We use numerical simulations to better characterize the difference
between the ground state and the demagnetized state. For d>=3 the random-field
Ising model displays a disorder induced phase transition between a paramagnetic
and a ferromagnetic state. The locations of the critical points R_c(DS),
R_c(GS) differ for the demagnetized state and ground state. Consequently, it is
in this regime that the optimization of the demagnetized stat is the worst
whereas both deep in the paramagnetic regime and in the ferromagnetic one the
states resemble each other to a great extent. We argue based on the numerics
that in d=3 the scaling at the transition is the same in the demagnetized and
ground states. This claim is corroborated by the exact solution of the model on
the Bethe lattice, where the R_c's are also different.

dominates the photoconductivity in the direction of the static potential

recently reported in D$_s^+\eta$ and D$^0$K$^+$ final states by the SELEX

D$_s^*(2112)$, although the predicted mass and strong decay branching fractions
for this assignment are not in agreement with the SELEX data. The reported
dominance of D$_s\eta$ over DK appears especially problematic. An intriguing
similarity to the K$^*(1414)$ is noted. $2^3\S_1$--$^3\D_1$ configuration
mixing is also considered, and we find that this effect is unlikely to resolve
the branching fraction discrepancy. Other interpretations as a $c\bar s$-hybrid
or a two-meson molecule are also considered, but appear unlikely. Thus, if this
state is confirmed, it will require reconsideration of the systematics of
charmed meson spectroscopy and strong decays.

we consider the lowest q\bar{q} Fock state with the constituent quark and

vector meson, the bound-state equations for the transverse and longitudinal
polarizations look different from each other. However, eventually after
imposing a cutoff which is invariant under the parity and boost
transformations, one finds these two are identical, giving the same mass and
the same (spin-independent) LC wavefunction. When the vector interaction
becomes larger than a critical value, the vector state forms a bound state,
whose mass decreases as the interaction becomes stronger. While the LC
wavefunction of the pseudo-scalar meson is broadly distributed in longitudinal
momentum (x) space, that of the vector meson is squeezed around x=1/2.

one of my motivations is to present some of the older work on

the essential features of the techniques. In particular, we see how rewriting
the Lagrangian in terms of an appropriate composite background field and
performing a perturbative loop expansion gives non-perturbative information
about the vacuum of the theory (the fermion condensate). The effective
potential for QED in a constant electromagnetic background field strength is
derived, and compared to the analogous calculation in non-Abelian Yang-Mills
theory. The Yang-Mills effective potential shows that the ``perturbative''
vacuum of Yang-Mills theory is unstable, and the true vacuum has a non-trivial
gauge field background. Finally, I describe how some of the limitations seen in
the non-supersymmetric theories are removed by supersymmetry, which allows for
exact computation of the effective superpotential in many cases.

properties of the participating hadrons in hot and dense matter, paying a
particular attention to the in-medium properties of antikaons at finite
temperature. The determination of the temperature and chemical potential at
freeze-out conditions compatible with the ratio $K^-/K^+$ is very delicate, and
depends on the approach adopted for the antikaon self-energy. Different
approaches for the $K^-$ self-energy have been considered: non-interacting
$K^-$, on-shell self-energy and single-particle spectral density. We observe
that the use of an energy dependent $\bar{K}$ spectral density lowers
considerably the freeze-out temperature with respect to the on-shell approach.
We also conclude that the full off-shell approach gives rise to the ""broad-band
equilibration"" advocated by Brown, Rho and Song.

  Specification in the Classical Field Theory","submitted to Phys. Rev. E",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  We discuss a general definition of directional derivative of any tensor flow
field and its practical applications in physics. It is shown that both
Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions as complementary types of flow field
specifications adopted in modern theoretical hydrodynamics, imply two
complementary types of directional derivatives as corresponding mathematical
constructions. One of them is the Euler substantive derivative useful only in
the contexts of initial Cauchy problem and the other, called here as the local
directional derivative, arises only in the context of so-called final Cauchy
problem. The choice between Lagrangian and Eulerian specifications is
demonstrated to be equivalent to the choice between space-time with Euclidean
or Minkowski metric for any flow field domain, respectively. Mathematical
consideration is developed within the framework of diffeomorfic transformations
for general 4-dimensional differentiable manifold. The analytical expression
for local directional derivative is formulated in form of a theorem. Although
the consideration is developed for ideal one-component (scalar) flow field, it
can be easily generalized to any tensor field. Some implications of the local
directional derivative concept for the classical theory of fields are also
explored.

modified radiative properties in vacuum near a dielectric surface. A cloud of
cold atoms was created using a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and optical molasses
cooling. Evanescent waves (EW) were used to observe the behavior of the atoms
near the surface. We observed an increase of the absorption linewidth with up
to 25% with respect to the free-space value. Approximately half the broadening
can be explained by cavity-quantum electrodynamics (CQED) as an increase of the
natural linewidth and inhomogeneous broadening. The remainder we attribute to
local Stark shifts near the surface. By varying the characteristic EW length we
have observed a distance dependence characteristic for CQED.

scaling as N^3 with its length N, drift-diffusion dynamics for f_c < f < f^*,
and a dynamical transition to an unraveling mode of strand separation at f =
