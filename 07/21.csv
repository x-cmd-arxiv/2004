black holes (SMBHs) using high-resolution self-consistent gasdynamical
simulations of binary equal- and unequal-mass mergers of disk galaxies. The
galaxy models are consistent with the LCDM paradigm of structure formation and
the simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. We
find that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close SMBH pair
at the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adopted
force resolution of ~ 100 pc. Instead, the final SMBH separation in
unequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of the
merging galaxies is modified by dissipation. In the absence of dissipation, the
satellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completed
leaving its SMBH wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnant
for the formation of a close pair. In contrast, we show that gas cooling
facilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companion
galaxy to tidal disruption. Moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxies
constructed to obey the M(BH)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending on
whether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of the
mass ratio of the merging systems. Collisionless simulations reveal that
remnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role of
gas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.
  In dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associated
with the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by star
formation provides the necessary fuel to the SMBHs and allows the merger
remnants to satisfy the relation.

partially at redshifts beyond reionization. Without knowing the instrinsic
properties of galaxies at z = 6.5, this attenuation is hard to infer in any one
source, but can be infered from a comparison of luminosity functions of
lyman-alpha emitters at redshifts just before and after reionization. We
combine published surveys of widely varying depths and areas to construct
luminosity functions at z=6.5 and 5.7, where the characteristic luminosity
L_star and density phi_star are well constrained while the faint-end slope of
the luminosity function is essentially unconstrained. Excellent consistency is
seen in all but one published result. We then calculate the likelihood of
obtaining the z=6.5 observations given the z=5.7 luminosity function with (A)
no evolution and (B) an attenuation of a factor of three. Hypothesis (A) gives
an acceptable likelihood while (B) does not. This indicates that the z=6.5
lyman-alpha lines are not strongly suppressed by a neutral intergalactic medium

experiments show a large spread and conflicting estimates. According to the
plasma-redshift theory, the Hubble's constant varies with the plasma densities
along the line of sight. It varies then slightly with the direction and the
distance to a supernova and a galaxy. The relation between the magnitudes of
type Ia supernovae and their observed redshifts results in an Hubble's constant
with an average value in intergalactic space of 59.44 km per s per Mpc. The
standard deviation from this average value is only 0.6 km per s per Mpc, but
the standard deviation in a single measurement is about 8.2 km per s per Mpc.
These deviations do not include possible absolute calibration errors. The
experiments show that the Hubble's constant varies with the intrinsic redshifts
of the Milky Way galaxy and the host galaxies for type Ia supernovae, and that
it varies with the galactic latitude. These findings support the
plasma-redshift theory and contradict the contemporary big-bang theory.
Together with the previously reported absence of time dilation in type Ia
supernovae measurements, these findings have profound consequences for the

result from interactions involving collective phenomena such as bars, oval
disks, spiral structure, and triaxial dark halos. This paper summarizes a
review by Kormendy & Kennicutt (2004) using, in part, illustrations of
different galaxies. In simulations, bars rearrange disk gas into outer rings,
inner rings, and galactic centers, where high gas densities feed starbursts.
Consistent with this picture, many barred and oval galaxies have dense central
concentrations of gas and star formation rates that can build bulge-like
stellar densities on timescales of a few billion years. We conclude that
secular evolution builds dense central components in disk galaxies that look
like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas.
We call these pseudobulges. Many pseudobulges can be recognized because they
have characteristics of disks: (1) flatter shapes than those of classical
bulges, (2) correspondingly large ratios of ordered to random velocities, (3)
small velocity dispersions, (4) spiral structure or nuclear bars, (5) nearly
exponential brightness profiles, and (6) starbursts. These structures occur
preferentially in barred and oval galaxies in which secular evolution should be
most rapid. Thus a variety of observational and theoretical results contribute
to a new paradigm of secular evolution that complements hierarchical
clustering.

located behind very large HI column densities. The resulting dust-to-gas ratio

low dust-to-metal ratio in the burst environment. We find that a neighbouring

the host of GRB 030429. The small impact parameter of this nearby galaxy, which

the bright transient was in its quiescent state in July 2000 and June 2003
(both observations were made nearly 2 years after the end of their preceding
outbursts). The quiescent spectrum during the first observation is well
represented by a two component model (a neutron-star atmosphere model plus a
power-law component which dominates at energies above 2 keV). During the second
observation (which was roughly of equal duration to the first observation) we
found that the power-law component could no longer be detected. Our spectral
fits indicate that the effective temperature of the neutron-star surface was

lower during the second observation compared to the first observation. We

neutron star, usually in an eccentric orbit. The Be star has strong equatorial
winds occasionally forming a circumstellar disk. When the neutron star
intersects the disk the accretion rate dramatically increases and a transient
accretion disk can be formed around the compact object. This disk can last
longer than a single orbit in the case of major outbursts. If the disk rotates
faster than the neutron star, the Cheng-Ruderman mechanism can produce a
current of relativistic protons that would impact onto the disk surface,
producing gamma-rays from neutral pion decays and initiating electromagnetic
cascades inside the disk. In this paper we present calculations of the
evolution of the disk parameters during both major and minor X-ray events, and

  Science Workshop",,,,"astro-ph",,"  An important recent discovery by Pfahl et al. (2002) is that there are two
classes of Be X-ray binaries: one with orbits of small eccentricity (<0.25), in
which the neutron stars received hardly any kick velocity at birth and a class
with substantial orbital eccentricities, in which the neutron stars received a
kick velocity of order 100 km/s at birth. Also many of the double neutron stars
(5 out of 7) have a low orbital eccentricity (0.09 to 0.27), which indicates
that their second-born neutron stars received hardly any velocity kick at
birth. These second-born neutron stars tend to have low masses (1.25 to 1.35
Msun). It is proposed that the low-mass, low-kick neutron stars are formed by
the electron capture of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of stars with initial masses
below about 12-14 Msun, while the high-kick neutron stars originated from the
photo-disintegration collapse of the iron cores of stars which started out with
masses larger than this limit. The latter group may be further subdivided into
two classes of different mass.

radio galaxy 3C 120 performed simultaneously with RXTE. The time-averaged
spectrum is Seyfert-like, with a reflection amplitude R ~ 0.5, and a neutral Fe
K line with equivalent width ~53 eV. The line is slightly broadened with a
FWHM$\approx 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is consistent with arising from an
accretion disc radius of $\ga 75$ $GM/c^2$ at an inclination angle of ~10
degrees, consistent with the limit of < 14 degree derived from the radio jets.
At low energies the spectrum requires excess absorption above the Galactic
value and a soft excess which is best fit with a bremsstrahlung model
(kT=0.3-0.4 keV). The total luminosity in the bremsstrahlung component is just
under half of the total hard X-ray luminosity. Weak O VII and O VIII edges are
detected with high precision, suggesting the presence of a warm absorber
component. A two-component ionized disc model, with a very highly ionized
reflector presumably arising from very close to the black hole, is only a small
improvement over a truncated disc model. The strength of the soft X-ray
emission features produced by the distant neutral reflector are overpredicted
in our solar abundance model, implying that the heavy metal abundance in 3C 120
is subsolar. The total count-rate declined by 20 per cent over the course of
the long observation, while small-scale rapid variability was present at the
level of a few percent. A possible increase in the Fe K line flux, significant
at the 90 per cent level, was identified at ~80 ks in the observation. The
total unabsorbed luminosity of 3C 120 implies that it is accreting close to its
Eddington rate, consistent with a model of an ionized thick disc. A connection
between accretion disc thickness and radio jet production is discussed.

superconductivity is caused by exchange of virtual phonons, which are quanta of

example, the negligible change in Tc of optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212)

order to follow the action principle of mechanics. In this work, this

using brute force numerical simulations and a modified version of the coherent
potential approximation that accounts for finite size effects. Excellent
agreement between both approaches is found. It is also shown that the inclusion
of disorder results in a better agreement between calculated and measured
spectra for the chlorosomes of green bacteria as compared to our previous
report, where we restricted ourselves to homogeneous cylinders [J. Phys. Chem.
B 106, 11474 (2002)]. We also investigate the localization properties of the
excitons responsible for the optical response. By analyzing an autocorrelation
function of the exciton wave function, we find a strongly anisotropic
localization behavior, closely following the properties of chiral wave
functions which previously have been found for homogenoeus helical cylinders
[J. Chem. Phys. 121, 946 (2004)]. It is shown that the circular dichroism
spectrum may still show a strong dependence on the cylinder length, even when
the exciton wave function is localized in a region small compared to the
cylinder's size.

temperature on the conduction threshold in disordered systems. Arrays with
randomly distributed local thresholds for conduction occur in systems ranging
from superconductors to metal nanocrystal arrays. Thermal fluctuations provide
the energy to overcome some of the local thresholds, effectively erasing them
as far as the global conduction threshold for the array is concerned. We
augment this thermal energy reasoning with percolation theory to predict the
temperature at which the global threshold reaches zero. We also study the
effect of capacitive nearest-neighbor interactions on the effective charging
energy. Finally, we present results from Monte Carlo simulations that find the
lowest-cost path across an array as a function of temperature. The main result
of the paper is the linear decrease of conduction threshold with increasing
temperature: $V_t(T) = V_t(0) (1 - 4.8 k_BT P(0)/ p_c) $, where $1/P(0)$ is an
effective charging energy that depends on the particle radius and interparticle
distance, and $p_c$ is the percolation threshold of the underlying lattice. The
predictions of this theory compare well to experiments in one- and
two-dimensional systems.

dimensional numerical code based on spectral methods, in the slow rotation,
relativistic Cowling and anelastic approximations. Principally, after a short
description of the gravity modes due to smooth composition gradients, we focus
our analysis on the question of how the inertial modes are affected by
non-barotropicity of the nuclear matter. In our study, the deviation with
respect to barotropicity results from the frozen composition of non-superfluid
matter composed of neutrons, protons and electrons, when beta equilibrium is
broken by millisecond oscillations. We show that already for moderatly fast
rotating stars the increasing coupling between polar and axial modes makes
those two cases less different than for very slowly rotating stars. In
addition, as we directly solve the Euler equations, without coupling only a few
number of spherical harmonics, we always found, for the models that we use, a
discrete spectrum for the $l = m = 2$ inertial mode. Finally, we find that, for
non-barotropic stars, the frequency of this mode, which is our main focus,
decreases in a non-negligible way, whereas the time dependence of the energy
transfer between polar and axial modes is substantially different due to the
existence of low-frequencies gravity modes.

introduces the right-handed neutrino as an essential member of each family and
also provides (rather reliably) the Dirac mass of the tau-neutrino by relating
it to the top quark mass; (ii) SUSY grand unification together with the scale
of the meeting of the three gauge couplings, which provides the scale for the

  Sciences at Oklahoma State University. Thesis advisor: K.S. Babu",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In this thesis, we study the hidden symmetries in the SM and also use
discrete gauge symmetries as model building tools to solve various problems in
the SM as well as the MSSM, such as R-parity, mu-term, stabilizing the axion
solutions, etc. The flavor independent non-supersymmetric SM at the
renormalizable level has a discrete Z_3 gauge symmetry known as baryon parity.
It is anomaly free at the discrete level as a result of the existence of three
generations. The symmetry can effectively act as the Baryon number up to the
\Delta B=3 mod 3 level which is also consistent with the prediction from
non-perturbative processes corrections in the SM, such as electroweak instanton
and sphaleron processes. This symmetry is not consistent with the simple GUTs
since those theories explicitly break it. Thus this baryon parity provides a
strong hint for new physics like GUTs. Quantum mechanically, we estimate the
triple nucleon decay rate which is predicted by the existence of this symmetry.
We find a simple U(1) realization with the presence of right-handed neutrinos,
from which this baryon parity can naturally emerge. Gauged R-parity is studied
in the following chapter. We also study various different approaches to the
mu-term problem via a symmetry classification. One explicit example in terms of
a Z_4 subgroup of the anomalous U(1) symmetry is given. Another solution arises
from a SUSY version of QCD invisible axion. Discrete flavor gauge symmetries
are discussed to explain the observed hierarchy fermion masses. D-term
splitting problem can then be avoided. In the last part, we show how to use
discrete gauge symmetries to stabilize the QCD invisible axion solutions, for
both DFSZ and KSVZ invisible axion models.

flatness is obtained with a single condition involving the brane tensions,
which are in general different and may be both positive, and another
characteristic of the branes, vorticity. We speculate that the adjustment of
the effective four-dimensional cosmological constant may occur through the
exchange of vorticity between the branes. We then give exact instanton type
solutions for sigma models targeted on a general K\""ahler manifold, and
elaborate in this framework on multi-instantons of the O(3) sigma model. The
latter have branes, possibly with vorticities, at the instanton positions, thus
generalizing our two-brane solution.

extensively as static solutions at finite N. The existence of topologicaly
distinct static configurations suggests the possibility of D-brane topology
change within this model, however a dynamical solution interpolating between
topologies is still somewhat elusive. In this paper, we study this model in the
limit of infinite dimensional matrices, where new solutions-- the fuzzy
cylinder and the fuzzy plane among them-- appear. We argue that any dynamics
which involves topology change will likely only occur in this limit, after
which we study the decay of a fuzzy cylinder into an infinite collection of
fuzzy spheres as both a classical and a quantum phenomenon. We conclude from
this excercise that in certain limits, matrix models offer a viable framework
in which to study topological dynamics, and could perhaps be a precursor to a
viable theory of space-time topological dynamics.

generalization of the idea of lifting a Galois representation along an isogeny
of algebraic groups. The weaker notion only takes into account an isogeny of
the derived groups and disregards the centres of the groups in question. The
weakly lifted representations are required to be geometric in the sense of a
conjecture of Fontaine and Mazur. The conjecture in question states that any
irreducible geometric representation is a twist of a subquotient of an \'etale
cohomology group of an algebraic variety over a number field.
  It is shown that a Galois representation associated to an abelian variety
admits a weak geometric lift to a group with simply connected derived group. In
certain cases, such a weak geometric lift is itself associated to an abelian
variety. This means that the conjecture of Fontaine and Mazur is confirmed for
these representations. In other cases, one may find a lift which can not be
found back in the etale cohomology of any abelian variety. The Fontaine--Mazur
conjecture remains open for these representations. Nevertheless, certain
consequences of the conjecture can be established.

here). Our results for the secondary instabilities of the primary wave show
that the mean flow leads to a weak destabilization of the base state against
Eckhaus and Transverse Amplitude Modulation instabilities, and introduces a new
longitudinal oscillatory instability which is absent without the coupling. We
compare our results with recent one dimensional amplitude equations for this

using velocity data obtained in a laboratory experiment for boundary layers

enhancements of a small-scale velocity increment and obtain the typical
velocity profile for vortex tubes. Their radii are of the order of the
Kolmogorov length. Their circulation velocities are of the order of the
root-mean-square velocity fluctuation. We also obtain the distribution of the
interval between successive enhancements of the velocity increment as the
measure of the spatial distribution of vortex tubes. They tend to cluster
together below about the integral length and more significantly below about the
Taylor microscale. These properties are independent of the Reynolds number and
are hence expected to be universal.

implement all possible threshold access structures. Closely related to secret
sharing, data hiding has a more demanding security requirement: that the data
remain secure against unrestricted LOCC attacks. In the limit of hiding a large
amount of data, our protocols achieve an asymptotic rate of one hidden qubit
per local physical qubit. That is, each party holds a share that is the same
size as the hidden state to leading order, with accuracy and security
parameters incurring an overhead that is asymptotically negligible. The data
hiding states have very unusual entanglement properties, which we briefly
discuss.

position shift) due to radiation reaction agrees exactly with the result
obtained using the Lorentz-Dirac force in classical electrodynamics. We also
point out that the one-loop correction to the potential may contribute to the
position change in this limit.

strongly enhanced by a nonstationary field so that the penetration through the
barrier becomes not exponentially small. This constitutes an extremely unusual
phenomenon of quantum physics called Euclidean resonance. A certain
nonstationary barrier is proposed with a very low WKB tunneling rate. The
quantum dynamics of this barrier is mapped on resonant tunneling across a
static double barrier with a resonant level inside. The real penetration
through the dynamical barrier is not exponentially small providing an example
of Euclidean resonance. Therefore, the Schoedinger equation allows solutions of
the type of Euclidean resonance. The counterintuitive phenomenon of Euclidean
resonance is a dynamical analogue of static resonant tunneling.

logical functions of three distinct conditional local operations. Each of these
local operations can be verified by measuring a corresponding truth table of
four local inputs and four local outputs. The quantum parallelism of the gate
can then be observed directly in a set of three simple experimental tests, each
of which has a clear intuitive interpretation in terms of classical logical
operations. Specifically, quantum parallelism is achieved if the average
fidelity of the three classical operations exceeds 2/3. It is thus possible to
evaluate the essential quantum parallelism of an experimental controlled-NOT
gate by testing only three characteristic classical operations performed by the
gate.
