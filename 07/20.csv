they cannot cope with rapid evolution - the best-fit to the latest SN-Ia data
shows late and very rapid evolution to w_0 = -2.85. However all of the standard
parametrisations (incorrectly) claim that this best-fit is ruled out at more
than 2-sigma, primarily because they track it well only at very low redshifts,
z < 0.2. Further they incorrectly rule out the observationally acceptable
region w << -1 for z > 1. Secondly the parametrisations give wildly different
estimates for the redshift of acceleration, which vary from z_{acc}=0.14 to
z_{acc}=0.59. Although these failings are largely cured by including
higher-order terms (3 or 4 parameters) this results in new degeneracies which
open up large regions of previously ruled-out parameter space. Finally we test
the parametrisations against a suite of theoretical quintessence models. The
widely used linear expansion in z is generally the worst, with errors of up to
10% at z=1 and 20% at z > 2. All of this casts serious doubt on the usefulness
of the standard two-parameter compressions in the coming era of high-precision
dark energy cosmology and emphasises the need for decorrelated compressions

useful in a combined fit with the CMB. The inferred curvature of the linear
power spectrum and the evolution of its amplitude and slope with redshift are
consistent with expectations for LCDM models, with the evolution of the slope,
in particular, being tightly constrained. We use this information to constrain
systematic contamination, e.g., fluctuations in the UV background. This paper
should serve as a starting point for more work to refine the analysis,
including technical improvements such as increasing the size and number of the
hydrodynamic simulations, and improvements in the treatment of the various

forest transmitted flux. The effects we investigate here are usually not part
of hydrodynamic simulations and so need to be estimated separately. The most
important effect is that of high column density absorbers with damping wings,
which add power on large scales. We compute their effect using the
observational constraints on their abundance as a function of column density.
Ignoring their effect leads to an underestimation of the slope of the linear
theory power spectrum. The second effect we investigate is that of fluctuations
in the ionizing radiation field. For this purpose we use a very large high
resolution N-body simulation, which allows us to simulate both the fluctuations
in the ionizing radiation and the small scale LyaF within the same simulation.
We find an enhancement of power on large scales for quasars and a suppression
for galaxies. The strength of the effect rapidly increases with increasing
redshift, allowing it to be uniquely identified in cases where it is
significant. We develop templates which can be used to search for this effect
as a function of quasar lifetime, quasar luminosity function, and attenuation
length. Finally, we explore the effects of galactic winds using hydrodynamic
simulations. We find the wind effects on the LyaF power spectrum to be be
degenerate with parameters related to the temperature of the gas that are
already marginalized over in cosmological fits. While more work is needed to
conclusively exclude all possible systematic errors, our results suggest that,
in the context of data analysis procedures where parameters of the LyaF model
are properly marginalized over, the flux power spectrum is a reliable tracer of
cosmological information.

interesting characteristics of the gas and dust emission. In spite of the
expectation that the CN and CS morphology might closely follow the dense gas
traced by the dust continuum, both molecules avoid the most central cores.
Comparing the relative line strengths of various CN hyperfine components, this
appears not to be an opacity effect but to be due to chemical and physical
effects. The CN data also indicate enhanced emission toward the different
molecular outflows in the region. Regarding CS, avoiding the central cores can
be due to high optical depth, but the data also show that the CS emission is
nearly always associated with the outflows of the region. Therefore, neither CS
nor CN appear well suited for dense gas and disk studies in these two sources,
and we recommend the use of different molecules for future massive disk
studies. An analysis of the 1 and 3mm continuum fluxes toward IRAS20293+3952
reveals that the dust opacity index beta is lower than the canonical value of
2. Tentatively, we identify a decreasing gradient of beta from the edge of the

the core center and/or grain growth within the densest cores and potential
central disks. We detect 3mm continuum emission toward the collimated outflow

phases signifies the contamination of foreground signals in the derived CMB

cross correlation of phases of the derived CMB and foregrounds, and mark off
those multipoles in which the non-Gaussianity results from the foreground
contaminations. We apply this statistic on the derived signals from the 1-year

significance above 95% CL against the random phase hypothesis on 17 spherical

gaseous disk at non-co-orbital corotation resonances is studied by means of
numerical simulations. The degree of saturation of these resonances is
important in determining whether an eccentric giant planet embedded in a
protoplanetary disk experiences an eccentricity excitation or damping. We
perform calculations restricted to one or two resonances to investigate the
properties of two neighboring corotation resonances, as well as the properties
of a corotation resonance that overlaps a Lindblad resonance. We find that
these properties hardly differ from the case of an isolated corotation
resonance. In particular, although the torque of two neighboring corotation
resonances may differ from the sum of the torques of the corresponding
resonances considered as isolated, it never exceeds the sum of the fully
unsaturated isolated corotation resonances, and it saturates in a fashion
similar to an isolated resonance. Similarly, the presence of an underlying
Lindblad resonance hardly affects the corotation torque, even if that resonance
implies a torque strong enough to significantly redistribute the azimuthally
averaged surface density profile, in which case the corotation torque scales
with the resulting vortensity gradient. This set of numerical experiments thus
essentially validates previous analytic studies. As a side result, we show that
corotation libration islands misrepresented by a mesh of too low resolution can
lead to a strongly overestimated corotation torque. This may be an explanation
why the eccentricity of embedded Jupiter-sized planets was never observed to
undergo an excitation in the numerical simulations performed so far.

equivalent width of the 2200-2800A Fe II UV bump unless there is considerable
velocity structure corresponding to a microturbulent velocity parameter v_turb
> 100 km/s for the LOC models used here. This could be either microturbulence
in gas that is confined by some phenomenon such as MHD waves, or a velocity
shear such as in the various models of winds flowing off the surfaces of
accretion disks. The alternative way that we can find to simultaneously match
both the observed shape and equivalent width of the Fe II UV bump is for the Fe
II emission to be the result of collisional excitation in a warm, dense gas.
Such gas would emit very few lines other than Fe II. However, since the
collisionally excited gas would constitute yet another component in an already
complicated picture of the BELR, we prefer the model involving turbulence. In
either model, the strength of Fe II emission relative to the emission lines of
other ions such as Mg II depends as much on other parameters (either v_turb or
the surface area of the collisionally excited gas) as it does on the iron
abundance. Therefore, the measurement of the iron abundance from the FeII
emission in quasars becomes a more difficult problem.

distributed across the accretion disk. The peak separation is consistent with

formation of a population of cool fragments embedded within a background of
tenuous hot gas. The hot gas attains a quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. Although
the cool clouds are pressure confined by the hot gas, they fall into the
galactic potential, and their motion is subject to drag from the hot gas. The
release of gravitational energy due to the infall of the cool clouds is first
converted into their kinetic energy, and is subsequently dissipated as heat.
The cool clouds therefore represent a potentially significant energy source for
the background hot gas, depending upon the ratio of thermal energy deposited
within the clouds versus the hot gas. In this paper, we show that most of
dissipated energy is deposited in the tenuous hot halo gas, providing a source
of internal energy to replenish losses in the hot gas through bremsstrahlung
emission and conduction into the cool clouds. The heating from the motion of
the cool clouds allows the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium to

each of which the net radial mass flux is positive near the midplane and
negative at higher z. The flow distorts the magnetic field lines. In the arm
region, the gas flows nearly parallel to the arm, and therefore, the magnetic
field adopts a similar pitch angle. Between the arms, the gas flows out in

source of the time delay is the variation of the electromagnetic coupling, due
to dimensional reduction, which induces an energy dependence of the speed of

a few seconds in the case of Kaluza-Klein models to a few days for models with

FS373 in the NGC3258 group. Both kinematically peculiar subcomponents rotate in
the same sense as the main body of their host galaxy but betray their presence
by a pronounced bump in the rotation velocity profiles at a radius of about 1"".
The KDC in FS76 rotates at 10+/-3km/s, with the host galaxy rotating at
15+/-6km/s; the KDC in FS373 has a rotation velocity of 6+/-2km/s while the
galaxy itself rotates at 20+/-5km/s. FS373 has a very complex rotation velocity
profile with the velocity changing sign at 1.5 R_e. The velocity and velocity
dispersion profiles of FS76 are asymmetric at larger radii. This could be
caused by a past gravitational interaction with the giant elliptical NGC5044,
which is at a projected distance of 50kpc. We argue that these decoupled cores
are most likely not produced by mergers in a group or cluster environment
because of the prohibitively large relative velocities. A plausible alternative
is offered by flyby interactions between a dwarf elliptical or its disky
progenitor and a massive galaxy. The tidal forces during an interaction at the
relative velocities and impact parameters typical for a group environment exert
a torque on the dwarf galaxy that, according to analytical estimates, transfers
enough angular momentum to its stellar envelope to explain the observed
peculiar kinematics.

$b=-48^{o}.38$; 4.239 square-degree; J2000). The separation of stars into
different populations has been carried out by their spatial distribution. The
new approach reveals that model parameters are absolute magnitude dependent.
The scale height for thin disk decreases monotonously from absolutely bright to
absolutely faint stars in a range 265-495 pc, but there is a discontunity at
the absolute magnitude $M(g^{'})=10$ where the squared secans hiperbolicus
density law replaces the exponential one. The range of the scale-height for
thick disk, dominant in the absolute magnitude interval $5<M(g^{'})\leq9$, is
less: 805-970 pc. The local space density for thick disk relative to thin disk
decreases from 9.5% to 5.2% when one goes from the absolutely bright to faint
magnitudes. Halo is dominant in three absolute magnitude intervals and the
axial ratio for this component is almost the same for these intervals where
$c/a \sim 0.7$. The same holds for the local space density relative to the thin
disk with range (0.02-0.15)%. The model parameters estimated by comparison of
the observed space density functions combined for three populations per
absolute magnitude interval with the combined density laws agree with the cited
values in the literature. Also each parameter is equal to at least one of the
corresponding parameters estimated for different absolute magnitude intervals
by the new approach. We argue that the most appropriate Galactic model
parameters are those, that are magnitude dependent.

annealing, mesas first develop ridges along their edges, effectively creating
craters which then become step-free by a step flow process described in the

breakdown occurs on one edge of each mesa as sublimation proceeds. The
breakdown point then acts as a source of steps which spread out over the mesa
surface. The distribution of steps in the resulting step train depends on the
sublimation rate, direct step-step interaction and the diffusive exchange of
atoms among the steps. Computer simulations using BCF (Burton, Cabrera and

  Physics. For related papers, see http://www.geocities.com/dlevin2001/",,"10.1063/1.2128687",,"cs.CV cs.AI",,"  This paper shows how a machine, which observes stimuli through an
uncharacterized, uncalibrated channel and sensor, can glean machine-independent
information (i.e., channel- and sensor-independent information) about the
stimuli. First, we demonstrate that a machine defines a specific coordinate
system on the stimulus state space, with the nature of that coordinate system
depending on the device's channel and sensor. Thus, machines with different
channels and sensors ""see"" the same stimulus trajectory through state space,
but in different machine-specific coordinate systems. For a large variety of
physical stimuli, statistical properties of that trajectory endow the stimulus
configuration space with differential geometric structure (a metric and
parallel transfer procedure), which can then be used to represent relative
stimulus configurations in a coordinate-system-independent manner (and,
therefore, in a channel- and sensor-independent manner). The resulting
description is an ""inner"" property of the stimulus time series in the sense
that it does not depend on extrinsic factors like the observer's choice of a
coordinate system in which the stimulus is viewed (i.e., the observer's choice
of channel and sensor). This methodology is illustrated with analytic examples
and with a numerically simulated experiment. In an intelligent sensory device,
this kind of representation ""engine"" could function as a ""front-end"" that
passes channel/sensor-independent stimulus representations to a pattern
recognition module. After a pattern recognizer has been trained in one of these
devices, it could be used without change in other devices having different
channels and sensors.

classical negation), by finding a ``best'' answer set. Within the context of
inconsistent programs, it is natural to have a partial order on rules,
representing a preference for satisfying certain rules, possibly at the cost of
violating less important ones. We show that such a rule order induces a natural
order on extended answer sets, the minimal elements of which we call preferred
answer sets. We characterize the expressiveness of the resulting semantics and
show that it can simulate negation as failure, disjunction and some other
formalisms such as logic programs with ordered disjunction. The approach is
shown to be useful in several application areas, e.g. repairing database, where
minimal repairs correspond to preferred answer sets.

of order $k_{_B}\ell Mc/\hbar$, instead of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy

motivate the introduction of a quantum evolution equation for which the eikonal
approximation results in the geodesics of a four dimensional manifold. This
geodesic motion can be put into correspondence with general relativity. One
obtains in this way a quantum theory on a flat spacetime, obeying the rules of
the standard quantum theory in Lorentz covariant form, with a spacetime
dependent Lorentz tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, somewhat analogous to a gauge field,
coupling to the kinetic terms. Since the geodesics predicted by the eikonal
approximation, with appropriate choice of $g_{\mu\nu}$, can be those of general
relativity, this theory provides a quantum theory which could be underlying to
classical gravitation, and coincides with it in this classical ray
approximation. In order to understand the possible origin of the structure of
this equation, we appeal to the approach of Nelson in constructing a
Schroedinger equation from the properties of Brownian motion. Extending the
notion of Browninan motion to spacetime in a covariant way, we show that such
an equation follows from correlations between spacetime dimensions in the
stochastic process.

  inside black holes","Revtex, 7 pages",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph hep-th",,"  Several recently found properties of the event horizon of black holes are
discussed. One of them is the reflection of the incoming particles on the
horizon. A particle approaching the black hole can bounce on the horizon back,
into the outside world, which drastically reduces the absorption cross section
in the infrared region. Another, though related phenomenon takes place for
particles inside the horizon. A locked inside particle has, in fact, an
opportunity to escape into the outside world. Thus, the confinement inside the
horizon is not absolute. The escape from within the interior region of the
horizon allows the transfer of information from this region into the outside
world. This result may help resolve the information paradox for black holes.
Both the reflection and escape phenomena happen due to pure quantum reasons,
being impossible in the classical approximation.

of the phase of the fermion determinant at small quark-number chemical

these transitions should be the same. For all mu_I < m_pi the smoothness of
these transitions and the values of the Binder cumulant B_4, indicate that
these transitions are mere crossovers, and show no sign of the expected
critical endpoint. For mu_I > m_pi and a small isospin (I_3) breaking term
lambda, we do find evidence of a critical endpoint which would indicate that,
for lambda=0, there is a tricritical point on the phase boundary where the pion

density pinpoints towards very specific regions of the mSUGRA models:
coannihilation, focus and Heavy Higgs annihilation. The allowed regions widen
significantly when varying the top quark mass. Introducing some
non-universality in the gaugino masses significantly changes this conclusion as
in specific non-universal models the relic density upper limit can be easily
satisfied. This occurs with models where M1>M2 at the GUT scale when the LSP
has a high wino component. Models where M3<M2 favours the Higgs annihilation
channel in large regions of parameter space and at large $\tan\beta$ also
favours the annihilation of neutralinos in gauge bosons pairs.We discuss also

decay rates, and some hadronic matrix elements can be calculated on the lattice

theories that treat heavy quarks on the lattice. We summarize results on the
heavy quarkonium spectrum, which verify the validity of the effective theory
approach. We then discuss applications to $B$ physics, which is the main target
of the lattice theory of heavy quarks. We review progress in lattice
calculations of the $B$ meson decay constant, the $B$ parameter, semi-leptonic

observe the Landau pole. Our form factors reduce to the standard ones when the

generic characteristic with a suitable level structure over a connected smooth
algebraic variety X. Suppose that the endomorphism ring of $\phi$ is equal to
A. Then we show that the closure of the analytic fundamental group of X in
$SL_r(\mathbb{A}_F^f)$ is open, where $\mathbb{A}_F^f$ denotes the ring of
finite adeles of the quotient field F of A.
  From this we deduce two further results: (1) If X is defined over a finitely
generated field extension of F, the image of the arithmetic \'etale fundamental
group of X on the adelic Tate module of $\phi$ is open in
$GL_r(\mathbb{A}_F^f)$. (2) Let $\psi$ be a Drinfeld A-module of rank r defined
over a finitely generated field extension of F, and suppose that $\psi$ cannot
be defined over a finite extension of F. Suppose again that the endomorphism
ring of $\psi$ is A. Then the image of the Galois representation on the adelic

scheme is able to describe non-exponential, power-law like distributions of

a generalization of the discrete diffusion model by Millhauser, Salpeter and
Oswald [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 1503 (1988)] to the case of a
continuous, anomalous slow conformational diffusion. The corresponding
generalization is derived from a continuous time random walk composed of
nearest neighbor jumps which in the scaling limit results in a fractional
diffusion equation. The studied model contains three parameters only: the mean
residence time, a characteristic time of conformational diffusion, and the
index of subdiffusion. A tractable analytical expression for the characteristic
function of the residence time distribution is obtained. In the limiting case
of normal diffusion, our prior findings [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 3552
(2002)] are reproduced. Depending on the chosen parameters, the fractional
diffusion model exhibits a very rich behavior of the residence time
distribution with different characteristic time-regimes. Moreover, the
corresponding autocorrelation function of conductance fluctuations displays
nontrivial features. Our theoretical model is in good agreement with

fitting to experimental data of both diatomic molecules and bulk metals
simultaneously. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for a wide range of the
size of the clusters. This is important since almost all properties of the
small clusters are size dependent. The results show that the global minima of
the Al, Au and Pt clusters have structures based on either octahedral,
decahedral, icosahedral or a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral packing. The
54-atom icosahedron without a central atom is found to be more stable than the

and two dimensions, representing a transmural slice. We focus on two possible
mechanisms for the generation of reentrant events. We first investigate if
early-after-depolarizations occurring in M cells can initiate reentry. We find
that, even for large values of the long QT strength, the electrotonic coupling
between neighboring cells prevents early-after-depolarizations from creating a
reentry. We then study whether M cell domains, with their slow repolarization,
can function as wave blocks for premature stimuli. We find that the inclusion
of an M cell domain can result in some cases in reentrant excitations and we
determine the lifetime of the reentry as a function of the size and geometry of
the domain and of the strength of the long QT syndrome.

closely related evaluation of the geometric measure of entanglement to quantify
pure multi-party entanglement, (D) the test whether states are multi-party
entangled on the basis of witnesses based on second moments and on the basis of
linear entropic criteria, and (E) the evaluation of instances of maximal output
purities of quantum channels. We show that these problems can be formulated as
certain optimization problems: as polynomially constrained problems employing
polynomials of degree three or less. We then apply very recently established
known methods from the theory of semi-definite relaxations to the formulated
optimization problems. By this construction we arrive at a hierarchy of
efficiently solvable approximations to the solution, approximating the exact
solution as closely as desired, in a way that is asymptotically complete. For
example, this results in a hierarchy of novel, efficiently decidable sufficient
criteria for multi-particle entanglement, such that every entangled state will
necessarily be detected in some step of the hierarchy. Finally, we present
numerical examples to demonstrate the practical accessibility of this approach.

states (except the vacuum) appear as tangent vectors to C. The vacuum state

classified by the elements of Pic(C), the Picard group of C. In this way Pic(C)
appears as the parameter space for nonequivalent vacua. Our analysis is
modelled on, but not limited to, the case when C is complex projective space.
