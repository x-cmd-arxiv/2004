dynamical friction against the halo. However, recent attempts to use this
process to place constraints on the dark matter density in galaxies and

paper uses simplified numerical experiments to clarify several aspects of the
friction mechanism. I explicitly demonstrate the Chandrasekhar scaling of the
friction force with bar mass, halo density, and halo velocity dispersion. I
present direct evidence that exchanges between the bar and halo orbits at major
resonances are responsible for friction and study both individual orbits and
the net changes at these resonances. I also show that friction alters the phase
space density of particles in the vicinity of a major resonance, which is the
reason the magnitude of the friction force depends on the prior evolution. I
demonstrate that bar slow down can be captured correctly in simulations having
modest spatial resolution and practicable numbers of particles. Subsequent
papers in this series delineate the dark matter density that can be tolerated
in halos of different density profiles.

contamination of the secondary star and accretion of nova abundance-enriched
matter back to the white dwarf via the accretion disk or as a descendant of a
precursor binary that survived thermal timescale mass transfer. The scenario
involving pollution of the secondary by past novae may be supported by the
possible presence of a nova remnant-like nebula around EY Cyg.

cosmological dark energy density is expected to decouple from the
Friedman-Lemaitre energy density when the Friedman-Robertson-Walker scale
expansion becomes sub-luminal, at which time the usual microscopic interactions
of relativistic quantum mechanics (QED, QCD, etc) open new degrees of freedom.
The expected gravitational vacuum energy density at that scale would be
expected to freeze out due to the loss of gravitational coherence. We define
the vacuum energy which generates this cosmological constant to be that of a
zero temperature Bose condensate at this gravitational de-coherence scale.
Since the arguments presented involve primarily counting of degrees of freedom,
we expect the statistical equilibrium states of causally disconnected regions
of space to be independently identical. Thus, there is no luminal ""horizon""
problem associated with the lack of causal influences between spatially
separated regions in this approach. The scale of the amplitude of fluctuations
produced during de-coherence of cosmological vacuum energy are found to evolve
to values consistent with those observed in cosmic microwave background

the capabilities of the numerical scheme to yield satisfactory results, with an
accuracy comparable to that obtained by the so-called high-resolution

well inside the ultrarelativistic regime. Such central scheme can be
straightforwardly applied to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws for which
the characteristic structure is not explicitly known, or in cases where the
exact solution of the Riemann problem is prohibitively expensive to compute
numerically. Finally, we present comparisons with results obtained using

are investigated by extending previous commutative analyses to the infrared
limit of a maximally symmetric realization of the stringy uncertainty
principle. The effect of spacetime noncommutativity modifies the standard
consistency relation between the tensor spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio. We perform likelihood analyses in terms of inflationary observables
using new consistency relations and confront them with large-field inflationary
models with potential V \propto \vp^p in two classes of noncommutative
scenarios. We find a number of interesting results: (i) the quartic potential
(p=4) is rescued from marginal rejection in the class 2 GR case, and (ii) steep
inflation driven by an exponential potential (p \to \infty) is allowed in the
class 1 RS case. Spacetime noncommutativity can lead to blue-tilted scalar and
tensor spectra even for monomial potentials, thus opening up a possibility to
explain the loss of power observed in the cosmic microwave background
anisotropies. We also explore patch inflation with a Dirac-Born-Infeld tachyon
field and explicitly show that the associated likelihood analysis is equivalent
to the one in the ordinary scalar field case by using horizon-flow parameters.
It turns out that tachyon inflation is compatible with observations in all
patch cosmologies even for large p.

layers. In the present paper, we show the differences in the internal structure
of stars, according to the chosen scenario. Namely two stars with the same
observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical
composition) are completely different in their interiors according to their
past histories, which we reconstitute through the computations of their
evolutionary tracks. It may happen that stars with an initial overmetallicity
have a convective core while the stars which suffered accretion do not. We

the new Green Bank Telescope data. This event is characterized by a rotation
frequency step of 3 nHz, or 10^-11 in fractional frequency change along with a
short duration limited to a few days or a week. A marginally significant
frequency derivative step was also found. This glitch follows the main
characteristics of those in the slow period pulsars, but is two orders of
magnitude smaller than the smallest ever recorded. Such an event must be very
rare for millisecond pulsars since no other glitches have been detected when
the cumulated number of years of millisecond pulsar timing observations up to

of the youngest among the old recycled ones and there is likely a correlation

on a much smaller scale, the required adjustment of the star to a new

the amount of primary 12C mixed into the envelope by third dredge up and the
extent of the partial mixing zone. Then we perform a detailed analysis of the
reaction rates involved in the production of 19F and the effects of their
uncertainties. We find that the major uncertainties are associated with the
14C(alpha,gamma)18O and the 19F(alpha,p)22Ne reaction rates. For these two
reactions we present new estimates of the rates and their uncertainties. The
importance of the partial mixing zone is reduced when using our estimate for
the 14C(alpha,gamma)18O rate. Taking into account both the uncertainties
related to the partial mixing zone and those related to nuclear reactions, the
highest values of 19F enhancements observed in AGB stars are not matched by the
models. This is a problem that will have to be revised by providing a better
understanding of the formation and nucleosynthesis in the partial mixing zone,
also in relation to reducing the uncertainties of the 14C(alpha,gamma)18O
reaction rate. At the same time the possible effect of Cool Bottom Processing
at the base of the convective envelope should be included in the computation of
AGB nucleosynthesis. This process could in principle help matching the highest
19F abundances observed by decreasing the C/O ratio at the surface of the star,
while leaving the 19F abundance unchanged.

following indices: x ~ 0.8 for stars more massive than 0.8 Msolar, x ~ 0.9 for
0.3 - 0.8 Msolar and x ~ -2.2 at smaller masses (Salpeter's IMF would have

solidification in binary and ternary alloys. The computations are based on a
recently formulated phase-field model that is especially appropriate for
modelling non-isothermal solidification in multicomponent multiphase systems.
In this approach, a set of governing equations for the phase-field variables,
for the concentrations of the alloy components and for the temperature has to
be solved numerically, ensuring local entropy production and the conservation
of mass and inner energy. To efficiently perform numerical simulations, we
developed a numerical scheme to solve the governing equations using a finite
element method on an adaptive non-uniform mesh with highest resolution in the
regions of the phase boundaries. Simulation results of the solidification in
ternary Ni$_{60}$Cu$_{40-x}$Cr$_{x}$ alloys are presented investigating the
influence of the alloy composition on the growth morphology and on the growth
velocity. A morphology diagram is obtained that shows a transition from a
dendritic to a globular structure with increasing Cr concentrations.
Furthermore, we comment on 2D and 3D simulations of binary eutectic phase
transformations. Regular oscillatory growth structures are observed combined
with a topological change of the matrix phase in 3D. An outlook for the
application of our methods to describe AlCu eutectics is given.

seesaw models with Majorana massive neutrinos. Two models are considered: The
SM-seesaw, with the Standard Model Particle content plus three right handed
neutrinos, and the MSSM-seesaw, with the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
particle content plus three right handed neutrinos and their supersymmetric
partners. The widths for these decays are derived from a full one-loop
diagrammatic computation in both models, and they are analyzed numerically in
terms of the seesaw parameters, namely, the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices.
Several possible scenarios for these mass matrices that are compatible with
neutrino data are considered. In the SM-seesaw case, very small branching
ratios are found for all studied scenarios. These ratios are explained as a
consequence of the decoupling behaviour of the heavy right handed neutrinos. In
contrast, in the MSSM-seesaw case, sizeable branching ratios are found for some
of the leptonic flavor violating decays of the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons and
for some choices of the seesaw matrices and MSSM parameters. The relevance of
the two competing sources of lepton flavor changing interactions in the
MSSM-seesaw case is also discussed. The non-decoupling behaviour of the
supersymmetric particles contributing in the loop-diagrams is finally shown.

falsifiable predictions, and therefore cannot be a part of science. Cases which
have been claimed as successful predictions from the AP are shown to be not
that. Either they are uncontroversial applications of selection principles in
one universe (as in Dicke's argument), or the predictions made do not actually
logically depend on any assumption about life or intelligence, but instead
depend only on arguments from observed facts (as in the case of arguments by
Hoyle and Weinberg). The Principle of Mediocrity is also examined and shown to
be unreliable, as arguments for factually true conclusions can easily be
modified to lead to false conclusions by reasonable changes in the
specification of the ensemble in which we are assumed to be typical.
  We show however that it is still possible to make falsifiable predictions
from theories of multiverses, if the ensemble predicted has certain properties
specified here. An example of such a falsifiable multiverse theory is
cosmological natural selection. It is reviewed here and it is argued that the
theory remains unfalsified. But it is very vulnerable to falsification by
current observations, which shows that it is a scientific theory.

theory are discussed.

We compute tree-level scattering amplitudes involving twisted states, using
operator and current algebra techniques. We find that, due to zero-point
quantum fluctuations of the excited modes, twisted strings with a large winding
number $w$ are fuzzy on a scale $\sqrt{\log w}$, which can be much larger than
the string scale. Wave functions are smeared by an operator $\exp(\Delta(\nu)
\partial_+ \partial_-)$ reminiscent of the Moyal-product of non-commutative
geometry, which, since $\Delta(\nu)$ is real, modulates the amplitude rather
than the phase of the wave function, and is purely gravitational in its origin.
We compute the scattering amplitude of two twisted states and one tachyon or
graviton, and find a finite result. The scattering amplitude of two twisted and
two untwisted states is found to diverge, due to the propagation of
intermediate winding strings with vanishing boost momentum. The scattering
amplitude of three twisted fields is computed by analytic continuation from
three-point amplitudes of states with non-zero $p^+$ in the Nappi-Witten plane
wave, and the non-locality of the three-point vertex is found to diverge for
certain kinematical configurations. Our results for the three-point amplitudes
allow in principle to compute, to leading order, the back-reaction on the

find that this ``cyclicity-inducing measure'' is not covariant under

its generalizations. In this review we explain the general phenomenon of

two cases, corresponds to a classical integrable model. Finally, we include a
short overview of recent attempts to use gauge/string duality in order to
relate integrability of Yang--Mills dynamics with the hidden symmetry of a

are glued together along a 3-brane with constant positive curvature such that
{\em all} spatial dimensions form a compact manifold of topology $S^4$. It
turns out that the induced geometry on the brane is given by Einstein's static
universe. It is possible to achieve an anisotropy of the manifold which allows
for a huge hierarchy between the size of the extra dimension $R$ and the size
of the observable universe $R_U$ at present. This anisotropy is also at the
origin of a very peculiar property of our model: the physical distance between
{\em any two points} on the brane is of the order of the size of the extra
dimension $R$ regardless of their distance measured with the use of the induced
metric on the brane. In an intermediate distance regime $R \ll r \ll R_U$
gravity on the brane is shown to be effectively 4-dimensional, with
corresponding large distance corrections, in complete analogy with the
Randall-Sundrum II model. For very large distances $r \sim R_U$ we recover
gravity in Einstein's static universe. However, in contrast to the
Randall-Sundrum II model the difference in topology has the advantage of giving

principle, that the transition is actually related to a topology change in
spacetime. Similar phase transitions induced by unstable winding modes can be
studied in toy models. There, using T-duality of supersymmetric cycles, one can
identify a topology change of the Gregory--Laflamme type, which we associate

  introduction and conclusion; v3: added new comments and corrected typos",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Here we explore the possibility to obtain a non-relativistic proof of the
spin-statistics theorem. First, we examine the structure of axioms and theorems
involved in a relativistic Schwinger-like proof of the spin-statistics
relation. Second, starting from this structure we identify the relativistic
assumptions. Last, we reformulate these assumptions in order to obtain a
Galilean proof. We conclude that the spin-statistics theorem cannot be deduced
into the framework of Galilean quantum field theories for three space
dimensions because two of the assumptions needed to prove the theorem are
incompatible. We analyze, however, the conditions under which a non-relativist
proof could still be deduced.

B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt. 6 (2004) 495-501","10.1088/1464-4266/6/12/003",,"quant-ph",,"  We derive the quantum noise limit for the optical beam displacement of a
TEM00 mode. Using a multimodal analysis, we show that the conventional split
detection scheme for measuring beam displacement is non-optimal with 80%
efficiency. We propose a new displacement measurement scheme that is optimal
for small beam displacement. This scheme utilises a homodyne detection setup
that has a TEM10 mode local oscillator. We show that although the quantum noise
limit to displacement measurement can be surpassed using squeezed light in
appropriate spatial modes for both schemes, the TEM10 homodyning scheme
out-performs split detection for all values of squeezing.

allows us to detect sub-shot-noise spatial quantum correlation with up to one
hundred photoelectrons per mode, by means of a high efficiency CCD. The
statistics is performed in single-shot over independent spatial replica of the
system. The paper highlights the evidence of quantum correlation between
symmetrical signal and idler spatial areas in the far field, in the high gain
regime. In accordance with the predictions of numerical calculations the
observed transition from the quantum to the classical regime is interpreted as
a consequence of the narrowing of the down-converted beams in the very high
gain regime.

two-qubit gates between distant sites in engineered bosonic and fermionic

eigenvalue spectrum satisfying a certain condition, which is shown to be both
sufficient and necessary in mirror-symmetrical networks. The natures of the
effective two-qubit gates depend on the exchange symmetry for fermions and
bosons. For fermionic networks, the gates are entangling (and thus universal
for quantum computation). For bosonic networks, though the gates are not
entangling, they allow two-way simultaneous communications. Protocols of
entanglement generation in both bosonic and fermionic engineered networks are
discussed.
