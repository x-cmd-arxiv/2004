infrared L band spectrum along the line of sight toward NGC 7538 : IRS9. These
observations provide a diagnostic of the complex dynamics and chemistry in a
massive star forming region. The line shapes resemble P Cygni profiles with the
absorption and emission components shifted by ~7 km/s with respect to the
systemic velocity. Similar velocity components were observed in CO at 4.7 um,
but in contrast to CH4, the CO shows deep absorption due to a high velocity
outflow as well as absorption at the systemic velocity due to the cold outer
envelope. It is concluded that the gas phase CH4 abundance varies by an order
of magnitude in this line of sight: it is low in the envelope and the outflow
(X[CH4]<0.4e-6), and at least a factor of 10 larger in the central core. The
discovery of solid CH4 in independent ground and space based data sets shows
that methane is nearly entirely frozen onto grains in the envelope. It thus
appears that CH4 is formed by grain surface reactions, evaporates into the gas
phase in the warm inner regions of protostellar cores and is efficiently
destroyed in shocks related to outflows.

growing attention recently, and we have suggested that most GRBs and their
softer, less energetic fraternity, X-ray flashes (XRFs), can be understood
within a quasi-universal structured jet picture, given that the jet structure
for each individual burst is a Gaussian or similar function. Here we perform a
global test on such a quasi-universal Gaussian-like structured jet by comparing
Monte-Carlo simulation results with a broad spectrum of observational data.
Using the same set of input parameters as in the previous work (Zhang et al.
2004), we confront the model with more observational constraints. These
constraints include the burst redshift distribution, jet break angle
distribution, two-dimensional redshift vs. jet break angle distribution,
luminosity function, and Log N - Log P distribution. The results indicate that
the model is generally compatible with the data. This conclusion, together with
our previous tests with the observed jet break angle vs. isotropic energy and
observed peak energy vs. fluence relations, suggests that current long GRB and
XRF data are generally consistent with such a quasi-standard-energy and
quasi-standard-angle jet picture. With future homogeneous burst samples (such
as the one to be retrieved from the Swift mission), the refined GRB jet
structure can be further constrained through a global comparison between
various observed and predicted burst property distributions and relations.

the previous detection of the outflow in G9.62F. Although the gas-phase H2S

show a resolved but compact radio source which becomes optically thin at

oval-shaped or double ring remnant. The radio spectrum combined with the high
brightness temperature indicates that the emission is synchrotron, while the
morphology suggests that this is powered by a decelerating shock moving through
dense circumstellar material produced by a strong stellar wind. The radio
images of CI Cam are equally well fit by an expanding ellipsoid or two
expanding rings. The corresponding expansion speed in the plane of the sky was
about 12,000 km/s over the first few days, slowing by a factor of ~3 by the

the shape of the observed luminosity function and requires only a very small

systems in the ground and excited states is presented. It allows to fully
exploit the power of quantum-chemical programs designed for correlation
calculations of finite molecules. Using localized Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals
(both occupied and virtual ones), an effective Hamiltonian which can easily be
transferred from finite to infinite systems is built up. Correlation
corrections to the matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian are derived
from clusters. To treat correlation effects, multireference configuration
interaction (MRCI) calculations with singly and doubly excited configurations
(SD) are performed. This way one is able to generate both valence and
conduction bands where all correlation effects in the excited states as well as
in the ground state of the system are taken into account. An appropriate
size-extensivity correction to the MRCI(SD) correlation energies is developed
which takes into account the open-shell character of the excited states. This
approach is applicable to a wide range of polymers and crystals. In the present
work trans-polyacetylene is chosen as a test system. The corresponding band
structure is obtained with the correlation of all electrons in the system being
included on a high level of sophistication. The account of correlation effects
leads to substantial shifts of the ""center-of-mass"" positions of the bands
(valence bands are shifted upwards and conduction bands downwards) and a
flattening of all bands compared to the corresponding HF band structure.
Further an extention of the above approach to excitons (optical excitations) in
crystals is developed which allows to use standard quantum-chemical methods to
describe the electron-hole pairs and to finally obtain excitonic bands.

Choquard et al. at the free-fermion coupling $\Gamma=2$: in the thermodynamic
limit of an infinitely long strip, the particle density turns out to be a
nonconstant periodic function in space and the system exhibits long-range order
of the Wigner-crystal type. The aim of this paper is to describe, qualitatively
as well as quantitatively, the crystalline state for a larger set of couplings
$\Gamma=2\gamma$ ($\gamma=1,2,...$ a positive integer) when the plasma is
mappable onto a one-dimensional fermionic theory. The fermionic formalism,
supplemented by some periodicity assumptions, reveals that the density profile
results from a hierarchy of Gaussians with a uniform variance but with
different amplitudes. The number and spatial positions of these Gaussians
within an elementary cell depend on the particular value of $\gamma$. Analytic
results are supported by the exact solution at $\gamma=1$ ($\Gamma=2$) and by

homogeneous ordered phase, and a modulated ordered phase meet. Their bulk
universality classes are described by natural generalizations of the standard
$\phi^4$ model. Analyzing these models systematically via modern
field-theoretic renormalization group methods has been a long-standing
challenge ever since their introduction in the middle of the 1970s. We survey
the recent progress made in this direction, discussing results obtained via
dimensionality expansions, how they compare with Monte Carlo results, and open
problems. These advances opened the way towards systematic studies of boundary
critical behavior at $m$-axial Lifshitz points. The possible boundary critical
behavior depends on whether the surface plane is perpendicular to one of the
$m$ modulation axes or parallel to all of them. We show that the semi-infinite
field theories representing the corresponding surface universality classes in
these two cases of perpendicular and parallel surface orientation differ
crucially in their Hamiltonian's boundary terms and the implied boundary
conditions, and explain recent results along with our current understanding of
this matter.

other popular consensus models. Here the opinion s is a real number between 0

compatible if their opinions differ from each other by less than \epsilon. If
two neighbouring agents are compatible, they take the mean s_m of their

for any value of the confidence bound \epsilon. We propose as well a weaker

dipoles disposed in sites of an sc lattice and forming a cubic-shaped sample of
size determined by the cube edge length (N-1)a (a being the lattice constant, N
representing the number of dipolar planes). The dipolar field resulting from
the dipole-dipole interactions is calculated numerically in points of the axis
connecting opposite cube face centers (central axis) by collecting individual
contributions to this field coming from each of the N atomic planes
perpendicular to the central axis. The applied magnetic field is assumed to be
oriented along the central axis, magnetizing uniformly the whole sample, all
the dipoles being aligned parallelly in the direction of the applied field. The
frequency spectrum of magnetostatic waves propagating in the direction of the
applied field is found numerically by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation of
motion including the local (nonhomogeneous) dipolar field component; the mode
amplitude spatial distributions (mode profiles) are depicted as well. It is
found that only the two energetically highest modes have bulk-extended
character. All the remaining modes are of localized nature; more precisely, the
modes forming the lower part of the spectrum are localized in the subsurface
region, while the upper-spectrum modes are localized around the sample center.
We show that the mode localization regions narrow down as the cube size, N,
increases (we investigated the range of N=21 to N=101), and in sufficiently
large cubes one obtains practically only center-localized and surface-localized
magnetostatic modes.

These high permeability compositions of Ni-Fe-Cu and Ni-Fe-Mo match well with
those discovered experimentally. We monitor the connection of the magnetic
anisotropy with the number of minority spin electrons, Nmin. By raising Nmin
via artificially increasing the band-filling of Ni80Fe20, we are able to
reproduce the key features that underpin the magnetic softening we find in the

magnetocrystalline anisotropy on atomic short-range order in Ni80Fe20 is also
studied. Our calculations, based on a static concentration wave theory,

modifications can explain why the neutrinos do not exhibit a strong family

Higgs boson in the associated $t\bar tH$ production at the LHC. The results of
the Monte Carlo simulations of signal and background processes show that there
is a possibility of observing the statistically significant number of signal
events required for the discovery. Moreover, the analysis can be further
improved to reduce the number of false reconstructions of the $W$ boson.
  The analysis of the $t \bar t H$ production is independent of the model in
which the Higgs boson decays into the invisible channel. There are several
possibilities for models where $H\to invisible$ can be of interest. For this
thesis, we have studied the simplest supersymmetric model, called mSUGRA. The
results of the scans of the mSUGRA model parameter space show that the regions,
where the branching ratio of the lightest neutral Higgs boson to the lightest
neutralino pair is high, are excluded by current experimental constraints. The
$h \to b \bar b$ channel dominates, and the possibility for discovery in this c
hannel will not be suppressed by the invisible decays. This result does not
disqualify invisible channel as possible signature in other models.

included into the notion of a gauge theory in physics as well as some other
similar (but different) structures like Lie or Courant algebroids. For
Lagrangian gauge theories or Hamiltonian first class constrained systems, the
homological vector field is identified with the classical BRST transformation
operator. We define characteristic classes of a gauge system as universal
cohomology classes of the homological vector field, which are uniformly
constructed in terms of this vector field itself. Not striving to exhaustively
classify all the characteristic classes in this work, we compute those
invariants which are built up in terms of the first derivatives of the
homological vector field. We also consider the cohomological operations in the
space of all the characteristic classes. In particular, we show that the
(anti-)Poisson bracket becomes trivial when applied to the space of all the
characteristic classes, instead the latter space can be endowed with another
Lie bracket operation. Making use of this Lie bracket one can generate new
characteristic classes involving higher derivatives of the homological vector
field. The simplest characteristic classes are illustrated by the examples
relating them to anomalies in the traditional BV or BFV-BRST theory and to
characteristic classes of (singular) foliations.

string's worldsheet by a nonabelian super-Wilson line gives rise to a covariant
exterior derivative on loop space coming from a nonabelian 2-form on target

its consistency is verified by checking that its global gauge transformations
on loop space imply the familiar gauge transformations on target space. We
derive the second order gauge transformation from infinitesimal local gauge
transformations on loop space and find that a consistent picture is obtained
only when the sum of the 2-form and the 1-form field strengths vanish. The same
condition has recently been derived from 2-group gauge theory reasoning. We
observe that this condition implies that the connection on loop space is flat,
which is a crucial sufficient condition for the nonabelian surface holonomy
induced by it to be well defined. Finally we compute the background equations
of motion of the nonabelian 2-form by canceling divergences in the deformed
boundary state.

attention over the past decade, is to find and classify all nonlinear
deformations of linear abelian gauge theories.
  The first part of this paper summarizes and significantly elaborates a field-
theoretic deformation method developed in earlier work. As a key contribution
presented here, a universal geometrical structure common to a large class of
nonlinear gauge theory examples is uncovered. This structure is derived
geometrically from the deformed gauge symmetry and is characterized by a
covariant derivative operator plus a nonlinear field strength, related through
the curvature of the covariant derivative. The scope of these results
encompasses Yang-Mills theory, Freedman-Townsend theory, Einstein gravity
theory, in addition to their many interesting types of novel generalizations
that have been found in the past several years.
  The second part of the paper presents a new geometrical type of Yang-Mills
generalization in three dimensions motivated from considering torsion in the
context of nonlinear sigma models with Lie group targets (chiral theories). The
generalization is derived by a deformation analysis of linear abelian
Yang-Mills Chern-Simons gauge theory. Torsion is introduced geometrically
through a duality with chiral models obtained from the chiral field form of
self-dual 2+2 dimensional Yang-Mills theory under reduction to 2+1 dimensions.
Field-theoretic and geometric features of the resulting nonlinear gauge
theories with torsion are discussed.

very general linear symmetric systems of hyperbolic differential equations.
Curvelets are a recently developed multiscale system in which the elements are
highly anisotropic at fine scales, with effective support shaped according to
the parabolic scaling principle width ~ length^2 at fine scales. We prove that
for a wide class of linear hyperbolic differential equations, the curvelet
representation of the solution operator is both optimally sparse and well
organized. It is sparse in the sense that the matrix entries decay nearly
exponentially fast (i.e. faster than any negative polynomial), and
well-organized in the sense that the very few nonnegligible entries occur near
a shifted diagonal. Indeed, we actually show that the action of the wave-group
on a curvelet is well-approximated by simply translating the center of the
curvelet along the Hamiltonian flow--hence the diagonal shift in the curvelet
epresentation. A physical interpretation of this result is that curvelets may
be viewed as coherent waveforms with enough frequency localization so that they
behave like waves but at the same time, with enough spatial localization so
that they simultaneously behave like particles.

geometry"", in which objects are proalgebraic varieties: a proalgebraic variety
is by definition the projective limit of a projective system of algebraic
varieties. In this paper we construct Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson classes of
proalgebraic varieties, by introducing the notion of ``proconstructible
functions "" and ""$\chi$-stable proconstructible functions"" and using the
Fulton-MacPherson's Bivariant Theory. As a ""motivic"" version of a $\chi$-stable
proconstructible function, $\Ga$-stable constructible functions are introduced.
This construction naturally generalizes the so-called motivic measure and
motivic integration. For the Nash arc space $\Cal L(X)$ of an algebraic variety
$X$, the proconstructible set is equivalent to the so-called cylinder set or
constructible set in the arc space.

them. We discuss two parametrizations of the coherent states manifold
$SU(1,1)/U(1)$: as the Poincar{\'e} disk in the complex plane and as the
pseudosphere (a sphere in a Minkowskian space), and show that it is a natural
phase space for quantum systems with SU(1,1) symmetry.

linear-chain configuration of identical two-level atoms containing the energy
of a single quasi-resonant photon in the form of a collective excitation, where
the collective behaviour is mediated by exchange of transverse photons between
the atoms. For a circular configuration of atoms the effective Hamiltonian on
the radiationless subspace of the system can be diagonalized analytically. In
this case, the radiationless energy eigenstates carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ quantum
number $p=0,1, ..., N$ which is analogous to the angular momentum quantum
number $l= 0, 1, ...$, carried by particles propagating in a central potential,
such as a hydrogen-like system. Just as the hydrogen s-states are the only
electronic wave functions which can occupy the central region of the Coulomb
potential, the quasi-particle corresponding to a collective excitation of the
circular atomic sample can occupy the central atom only for vanishing
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ quantum number $p$. For large numbers of atoms in a maximally
subradiant state, a critical interatomic distance of $\lambda/2$ emerges both
in the linear-chain and the circular configuration of atoms. The spontaneous
decay rate of the linear configuration exhibits a jump-like ""critical""
behaviour for next-neighbour distances close to a half-wavelength. Furthermore,
both the linear-chain and the circular configuration exhibit exponential photon
trapping once the next-neighbour distance becomes less than a half-wavelength,
with the suppression of spontaneous decay being particularly pronounced in the
circular system. In this way, circular configurations containing sufficiently
many atoms may be natural candidates for {\it single-photon traps}.

  binary fields","23 pages, 9 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Shor's quantum algorithm for discrete logarithms applied to elliptic curve
groups forms the basis of a ""quantum attack"" of elliptic curve cryptosystems.
To implement this algorithm on a quantum computer requires the efficient
implementation of the elliptic curve group operation. Such an implementation
requires we be able to compute inverses in the underlying field. In [PZ03],
Proos and Zalka show how to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm to
compute inverses in the prime field GF(p). They employ a number of
optimizations to achieve a running time of O(n^2), and a space-requirement of
O(n) qubits (there are some trade-offs that they make, sacrificing a few extra
qubits to reduce running-time). In practice, elliptic curve cryptosystems often
use curves over the binary field GF(2^m). In this paper, we show how to
implement the extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials to compute inverses
in GF(2^m). Working under the assumption that qubits will be an `expensive'
resource in realistic implementations, we optimize specifically to reduce the
qubit space requirement, while keeping the running-time polynomial. Our
implementation here differs from that in [PZ03] for GF(p), and we are able to
take advantage of some properties of the binary field GF(2^m). We also optimize
the overall qubit space requirement for computing the group operation for
elliptic curves over GF(2^m) by decomposing the group operation to make it
""piecewise reversible"" (similar to what is done in [PZ03] for curves over
GF(p)).

  which first appeared in Los Alamos Science in 2002","Los Alamos Science 27, 110 (2002)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Ever since the advent of quantum mechanics, it has been clear that the atoms
composing matter do not obey Newton's laws. Instead, their behavior is
described by the Schroedinger equation. Surprisingly though, until recently, no
clear explanation was given for why everyday objects, which are merely
collections of atoms, are observed to obey Newton's laws. It would seem that,
if quantum mechanics explains all the properties of atoms accurately, they,
too, should obey quantum mechanics. This reasoning led some scientists to
believe in a distinct macroscopic, or ``big and complicated,'' world in which
quantum mechanics fails and classical mechanics takes over, although there has
never been experimental evidence for such a failure. Even those who insisted
that Newtonian mechanics would somehow emerge from the underlying quantum
mechanics as the system became increasingly macroscopic were hindered by the
lack of adequate experimental and theoretical tools. In the last decade,
however, this quantum-to-classical transition has become accessible to
experimental study and quantitative description, and the resulting insights are
the subject of this article.

also belongs to the class of density source-operator states. Moreover, for any
dimension d>2, the Werner state is in such a subclass of this class where each
density source-operator state satisfies also the perfect correlation form of
the original Bell inequality regardless of whether or not the Bell perfect
correlation restriction is fulfilled. The latter earlier unknown property of
the Werner state can be verified experimentally.
