using Data Release 1 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Both the imaging
and spectroscopy data products have been used to construct a catalogue of
nearest companions to a volume limited (0.03 < z < 0.1) sample of galaxies
drawn from the main galaxy sample of SDSS. Of the 13973 galaxies in the volume
limited sample, we have identified 12492 systems with companions at projected
separations less than 300 kpc. Star-formation rates for the volume-limited
sample have been calculated from extinction and aperture corrected H-alpha
luminosities and, where available, IRAS data. Specific star formation rates
were calculated by estimating galaxy masses from z-band luminosities, and
r-band concentration indices were used as an indicator of morphological class.
The mean specific star-formation rate is found to be strongly enhanced for
projected separations of less than 30 kpc. For late-type galaxies the
correlation extends out to projected separations of 300 kpc and is most
pronounced in actively star-forming systems. The specific star-formation rate
is observed to decrease with increasing recessional velocity difference, but
the magnitude of this effect is small compared to that associated with the
projected separation. We also observe a tight relationship between the
concentration index and pair separation; the mean concentration index is
largest for pairs with separations of approximately 75 kpc and declines rapidly
for separations smaller than this. This is interpreted as being due to the
presence of tidally-triggered nuclear starbursts in close pairs. Further, we
find no dependence of star formation enhancement on the morphological type or
mass of the companion galaxy

with the absence of absorption. Another source has a ~6 sigma detection in the
ROSAT All-Sky Survey, possibly complex radio structure, and no evidence for
strong X-ray absorption. For the third X-ray detection, the XMM-Newton spectrum
indicates a column density of NH=1.26+0.75/-0.51x10^22 cm^-2; this result,
coupled with the 2-10 keV luminosity of ~4x10^44 cgs, makes this source a

which gives clues to their past history and future evolution and yet is
difficult to measure with current techniques. In this paper we investigate new
metallicity indicators, based upon the strengths of stellar photospheric
features at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths. By combining the evolutionary
spectral synthesis code Starburst99 with the output from the non-LTE model
atmosphere code WM-basic, we have developed a code that can model the
integrated ultraviolet stellar spectra of star-forming regions at metallicities
between 1/20 and twice solar. We use our models to explore a number of spectral
regions that are sensitive to metallicity and clean of other spectral features.
The most promising metallicity indicator is an absorption feature between 1935
A and 2020 A, which arises from the blending of numerous Fe III transitions. We
compare our model spectra to observations of two well studied high redshift
star-forming galaxies, MS1512-cB58 (a Lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276), and
Q1307-BM1163 (a UV-bright galaxy at z = 1.411). The profiles of the
photospheric absorption features observed in these galaxies are well reproduced
by the models. In addition, the metallicities inferred from their equivalent
widths are in good agreement with previous determinations based on interstellar
absorption and nebular emission lines. Our new technique appears to be a
promising alternative, or complement, to established methods which have only a
limited applicability at high redshifts.

simulating several represent cases that all the cusp caustic lens anomalies and
the disagreements between monochromatic flux ratios and simple lens models
might be explained without any substructure in the primary lenses' dark matter
halos. Intergalactic LCDM halos are enough to naturally explain these cases.
However, thus far, spectroscopic gravitational lensing observations require
more small mass halos (~ 10^6 Msun) than is expected in the LCDM model.

based on a complete and consistent reanalysis of broad emission-line
reverberation-mapping data. From objects with multiple line measurements, we
find that the highest precision measure of the virial product is obtained by
using the cross-correlation function centroid (as opposed to the
cross-correlation function peak) for the time delay and the line dispersion (as
opposed to full width half maximum) for the line width and by measuring the
line width in the variable part of the spectrum. Accurate line-width
measurement depends critically on avoiding contaminating features, in
particular the narrow components of the emission lines. We find that the
precision (or random component of the error) of reverberation-based black hole
mass measurements is typically around 30%, comparable to the precision attained
in measurement of black hole masses in quiescent galaxies by gas or stellar
dynamical methods. Based on results presented in a companion paper by Onken et
al., we provide a zero-point calibration for the reverberation-based black hole
mass scale by using the relationship between black hole mass and host-galaxy
bulge velocity dispersion. The scatter around this relationship implies that
the typical systematic uncertainties in reverberation-based black hole masses
are smaller than a factor of three. We present a preliminary version of a
mass-luminosity relationship that is much better defined than any previous
attempt. Scatter about the mass-luminosity relationship for these AGNs appears
to be real and could be correlated with either Eddington ratio or object
inclination.

slightly more Li depleted than the younger Hyades and has a Li pattern almost
identical to that observed in the ~2 Gyr old IC 4651 and NGC 3680. As for the

variations of the order of ~0.2 dex do not affect Li depletion after the age of

constitute the major component of chondritic meteorites that originate in the
region between Mars and Jupiter and which fall to Earth. They appear to have
solidified rapidly from molten or partially molten drops. The heat source that
melted the chondrules remains uncertain. The intense radiation from a gamma-ray
burst (GRB) is capable of melting material at distances up to 300 light years.
These conditions were created in the laboratory for the first time when
millimeter sized pellets were placed in a vacuum chamber in the white
synchrotron beam at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The pellets
were rapidly heated in the X-ray and gamma-ray furnace to above 1400C melted
and cooled. This process heats from the inside unlike normal furnaces. The
melted spherical samples were examined with a range of techniques and found to
have microstructural properties similar to the chondrules that come from
meteorites. This experiment demonstrates that GRBs can melt precursor material
to form chondrules that may subsequently influence the formation of planets.

higher redshift FR II radio sources (0.4<z<0.6). Our results reflect what has
been found for FR II of lower redshift. The position of the nuclei on the plane
formed by optical and radio luminosities is related to their optical spectral
classification: the nuclei of both high and low excitation galaxies lie on the
correlation found for FRI sources, while broad-lined objects have a significant
optical excess. The nuclear properties of these sources are better understood
when considering the equivalent width of the [OIII] emission line with respect
to their optical luminosities. Even in the range of redshift considered here,
low excitation galaxies show peculiar nuclear properties, more similar to those
observed in FR I. This confirms that not all FRII are unified with quasars. Our
findings have important implications for the FRII-quasar unification scheme: by
reconsidering the classification of all 3CR radio galaxies with z<1 in the
light of their nuclear properties, we derive the opening angle of the obscuring
torus for different redshift bins. We find that the covering factor of the
obscuring structure decreases as redshift increases (theta ~ 44 deg for z<0.3
to theta ~ 56 deg for 0.5<z<1). We argue that this behavior may be interpreted
in the framework of the receding torus model, in which the opening angle of the
torus increases as the luminosity of the accretion disk around the central
black hole increases.

transient and black hole candidate XTE J1720-318 performed with INTEGRAL,
XMM-Newton and RXTE. The source, which underwent an X-ray outburst in 2003
January, was observed in February in a spectral state dominated by a soft
component with a weak high-energy tail. The XMM-Newton data provided a high
column density Nh of 1.2*e22 cm^{-2} which suggests that the source lies at the
Galactic Centre distance. The simultaneous RXTE and INTEGRAL Target of
Opportunity observations allowed us to measure the weak and steep tail, typical
of a black-hole binary in the so-called High/Soft State. We then followed the
evolution of the source outburst over several months using the INTEGRAL
Galactic Centre survey observations. The source became active again at the end
of March: it showed a clear transition towards a much harder state, and then
decayed to a quiescent state after April. In the hard state, the source was
detected up to 200 keV with a power law index of 1.9 and a peak luminosity of
7*e36 erg s^{-1} in the 20-200 keV band, for an assumed distance of 8 kpc. We
conclude that XTE J1720-318 is indeed a new member of the black hole X-ray
novae class which populate our galactic bulge and we discuss its properties in
the frame of the spectral models used for transient black hole binaries.

up planetary cores, which then accrete nebular gas. With current opacity
estimates for protoplanetary envelopes, this model predicts the formation of
Jupiter-mass planets in 2--3 Myr at 5 AU around solar-mass stars, provided that
the surface density of solids is enhanced over that of the minimum-mass solar
nebula (by a factor of a few). Working within the core-accretion paradigm, this
paper presents theoretical calculations which show that the formation of
Jupiter-mass planets orbiting M dwarf stars is seriously inhibited at all
radial locations (in sharp contrast to solar-type stars). Planet detection
programs sensitive to companions of M dwarfs will test this prediction in the
near future.

superfluid. We argue for the presence of ordered vortex cores with a broken
discrete symmetry in the nearby superfluid phase, and that proliferating these
degenerate but distinct vortices with equal amplitudes produces the Coulomb
phase. This provides a simple physical description of the origin of the exotic
excitations of the Coulomb state. The physical picture is formalized by means
of a dual description of three-dimensional bosonic systems in terms of
fluctuating quantum mechanical vortex loops. Such a dual formulation is
extensively developed. It is shown how the Coulomb phase (as well as various
other familiar phases) of three-dimensional bosonic systems may be described in
this vortex loop theory. For bosons at half-filling and the closely related
system of spin-1/2 quantum magnets on a cubic lattice, fractionalized phases as
well as bond or `box' ordered states are possible. The latter are analyzed by
an extension of techniques previously developed in two spatial dimensions. The
relation between these `confining' phases with broken translational symmetry

of one-loop renormalization for the VLDS theory, which confirms Janssen's

a harmonic potential. According to Kohn's theorem, the frequency of this
collective mode is not affected by an interaction between the atoms and is
always equal to the trap frequency. This remarkable property, however, does not
necessarily hold in an approximate theory. We explicitly prove that the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA),
including a coupling between fluctuations in the density and Cooper channels,
is consistent with both Kohn's theorem as well as Goldstone's theorem. This
proof can be immediately extended to the strong-coupling superfluid theory
developed by Nozi\'eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR), where the effect of superfluid
fluctuations is included within the Gaussian level. As a result, the NSR-GRPA
formalism can be used to study collective modes in the BCS-BEC crossover region
in a manner which is consistent with Kohn's theorem. We also include the effect
of a Feshbach resonance and a condensate of the associated molecular bound
states. A detailed discussion is given of the unusual nature of the Kohn mode
eigenfunctions in a Fermi superfluid, in the presence and absence of a Feshbach
resonance. When the molecular bosons feel a different trap frequency from the
Fermi atoms, the dipole frequency is shown to {\it depend} on the strength of
effective interaction associated with the Feshbach resonance.

techniques based on random perturbation of data records have been proposed
recently. In this paper, we present a generalized matrix-theoretic model of
random perturbation, which facilitates a systematic approach to the design of
perturbation mechanisms for privacy-preserving mining. Specifically, we
demonstrate that (a) the prior techniques differ only in their settings for the
model parameters, and (b) through appropriate choice of parameter settings, we
can derive new perturbation techniques that provide highly accurate mining
results even under strict privacy guarantees. We also propose a novel
perturbation mechanism wherein the model parameters are themselves
characterized as random variables, and demonstrate that this feature provides
significant improvements in privacy at a very marginal cost in accuracy.
  While our model is valid for random-perturbation-based privacy-preserving
mining in general, we specifically evaluate its utility here with regard to
frequent-itemset mining on a variety of real datasets. The experimental results
indicate that our mechanisms incur substantially lower identity and support
errors as compared to the prior techniques.

the cosmology of a brane world in a five dimensional bulk and find that it
contradicts the results obtained by using a factorizable ansatz. We explicitly
identify the problem with the latter in the IIB case. These arguments support
our previous work on this question.

lift in M-theory to M5 branes wrapping divisors of arithmetic genus 1 in the

stacks of D7 branes at loci of enhanced gauge symmetry. The resulting theories
exhibit gaugino condensation, and generate a nonperturbative superpotential for

cycles of arithmetic genus $\chi \geq 1$ (and how $\chi > 1$ divisors can
contribute to the superpotential, in the presence of flux). This second class

choose positive integers d1, d2, d3, set r = d1 + d2 + d3 - 3, and consider the

temperatures, a diagnostic variable related to tropospheric temperature

mesh contains the singular points and by simply discarding the DVR functions
corresponding to those points, all matrix elements become well-behaved, the
boundary conditions are satisfied and the calculation is rapidly convergent.

expansion. It is demonstrated here that in practical terms this is not the
case, and that the apparent distance - redshift relation derived from a Doppler
interpretation is reasonably consistent with supernova data (though not as good
as the standard model with dark energy). The normal Doppler effect is examined
in detail and shown to conserve energy as expected. Because of the equivalence
between the general relativistic space expansion paradigm and the Doppler
effect (as demonstrated) the long-standing problem of energy loss associated
with the expansion of the Universe is treated in a similar manner to the normal
well-behaved Doppler effect. The mechanism by which energy is conserved with
the normal Doppler shift is applied to the cosmological redshift and the energy
violation disappears. However, an additional luminosity-dependent recession
factor is introduced. The effect on astronomical objects is examined and it is
found to add only a small additional redshift to a body generating power by
nuclear means but can be very large for objects powered by gravity. A possible
connection to the claimed anomalous redshift of quasars is considered.

the stationary probability distributions of intermediate statistics are not

observational data, it offers no insight into why the cosmological expansion

boundary effects into observation in a consistent way that avoids
discontinuities and singularities. The theory predicts that the Universe is
expanding at a constant rate, the speed of light, and is a reasonable match for
apparent magnitude - redshift data for both supernovae and 3CR radio sources
using only one adjustable parameter, the absolute visual magnitude. Values of
-21.8 for the 3CR galaxies and -25.2 for the 3CR quasars give the best fit. The
new model is mapped to standard cosmology and predicts a deceleration parameter
with a time dependence of the form q(t)=1-2t/T, where T is the current age of
the Universe. The model of expanding space-time with expansion retarded by
gravity is usually associated with Friedmann's equation(s) but here is
considered erroneous, giving rise to spurious concepts such as dark energy - in

quantum laser to produce exact optical replica of ultrafast electron bunches.
The replica is generated in apparatus which consists of an input undulator
(energy modulator), and the short output undulator (radiator) separated by a
dispersion section. The radiation in the output undulator is excited by the
electron bunch modulated at the optical wavelength and rapidly reaches 100
MW-level peak power. We then use the now-standard method of ultrashort laser
pulse-shape measurement, a tandem combination of autocorrelator and spectrum
(FROG -- frequency resolved optical gating). The FROG trace of the optical
replica of electron bunch gives accurate and rapid electron bunch shape
measurements in a way similar to a femtosecond oscilloscope. Real-time
single-shot measurements of the electron bunch structure could provide
significant information about physical mechanisms responsible for generation
ultrashort electron bunches in bunch compressors. The big advantage of proposed
technique is that it can be used to determine the slice energy spread and
emittance in multishot measurements. It is possible to measure bunch structure
completely, that is to measure peak current, energy spread and transverse
emittance as a function of time. We illustrate with numerical examples the
potential of the proposed method for electron beam diagnostics at the European

conditions necessary for highly efficient coupling for single and double type-I
crystal producing polarization entangled states of light. We compare the
obtained approximate analytic expressions with the exact numerical solutions
and discuss the results for a case of BBO crystals.

consistent with the behavior of a class of superconductors and well known
particle decay rates. It also sets limits on the mass of the Higgs boson and
affects the stability of compact stars. In particular, type-I superconductors
in static conditions offer an example of a dynamics in which acceleration has
an upper limit.

Rep. 137, 49 (1986)] John S. Bell proposed how to associate
particle trajectories with a lattice quantum field theory, yielding what can be
regarded as a |Psi|^2-distributed Markov process on the appropriate
configuration space. A similar process can be defined in the continuum, for
more or less any regularized quantum field theory; such processes we call
Bell-type quantum field theories. We describe methods for explicitly
constructing these processes. These concern, in addition to the definition of
the Markov processes, the efficient calculation of jump rates, how to obtain
the process from the processes corresponding to the free and interaction
Hamiltonian alone, and how to obtain the free process from the free Hamiltonian
or, alternatively, from the one-particle process by a construction analogous to
""second quantization."" As an example, we consider the process for a second
quantized Dirac field in an external electromagnetic field.

subsystems) are uniquely determined by their reduced states of just over half
the parties; in other words, all the information in almost all N-party pure
states is in the set of reduced states of just over half the parties. For N
even, the reduced states in fewer than N/2 parties are shown to be an
insufficient description of almost all states (similar results hold when N is
odd). It is noted that Real Algebraic Geometry is a natural framework for any
analysis of parts of quantum states: two simple polynomials, a quadratic and a
cubic, contain all of their structure. Algorithmic techniques are described
which can provide conditions for sets of reduced states to belong to pure or
mixed states.

we show that unitary evolutions arise as a consequences of demanding
preservation of entropy in the evolution of a single pure quantum system, and
preservation of entanglement in the evolution of composite quantum systems.
