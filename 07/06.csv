funnel-wall jet is excluded from the axial funnel due to elevated angular

simulations. About half the gas shock heats to roughly the virial temperature
of the galaxy potential well before cooling, condensing, and forming stars, but
the other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower
temperatures, typically T<10^5 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures
is clearly bimodal. The ""cold mode"" of gas accretion dominates for low mass
galaxies (M_baryon < 10^{10.3}Msun or M_halo < 10^{11.4}Msun), while the
conventional ""hot mode"" dominates the growth of high mass systems. Cold
accretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently
draw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The
galaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of
cold and hot accretion rates, with cold mode dominating at high redshift and in
low density regions today, and hot mode dominating in group and cluster
environments at low redshift. Star formation rates closely track accretion
rates, and we discuss the physics behind the observed environment and redshift
dependence of galactic scale star formation. If we allowed hot accretion to be
suppressed by conduction or AGN feedback, then the simulation predictions would
change in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colors of
ellipticals and the cutoff of the galaxy luminosity function. The transition
between cold and hot accretion at M_h ~ 10^{11.4}Msun is similar to that found
by Birnboim & Dekel (2003) using 1-d simulations and analytic arguments. The
corresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at which
Kauffmann et al. (2003) find a marked shift in galaxy properties. We speculate
on connections between these theoretical and observational transitions.

distribution in the early stage of galaxy evolution, which can be different
from that of present-day evolved galaxies. We applied T03 model to LBGs and
constructed their expected SED. In order to examine the grain size distribution
of dust, we calculated the SEDs based on two distinct type of the distribution
models: a single-sized distribution and a power-law distribution with a slope
of $dN/da \propto a^{-3.5}$. We found that the single-sized and power-law dust
size distributions yield a very similar detectability of LBGs at the
submillimetre (submm). We also found that galaxies with a power-law dust
distribution have much less flux at mid-infrared (MIR) than the other. Then, we
applied the model to a gravitationally lensed LBG \cb (cB58), a unique probe of
the dust emission from LBGs. Our model framework well reproduced the hot dust
temperature under a natural assumption for this galaxy. We also examined the
detectability of LBGs at submm wavelengths in an eight-hour deep survey by
ALMA. By integrating over their redshifted SEDs with the observed luminosity
functions, we obtained the contribution of LBGs to the cosmic infrared
background radiation (CIRB). Although they have non-negligible amount of dust,
their contribution was found to be small, especially in the FIR $\sim 200
\mu$m. Thus, we need a strongly obscured population of galaxies which contains
a large amount of star formation, at some epoch in the history of the universe.

curvature and relativistic temperatures tend to increase the efficiency of
thermal driving in accelerating the outflow. Thus conversely to the classical
Parker wind, the outflow is accelerated even for polytropic indices higher than

distances between 3 and 10 Mpc will be observed, covering a wide range of
evolutionary stages and properties. Data from THINGS will complement SINGS, the
Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey. For the THINGS sample, high-quality
observations at comparable resolution will thus be available from the X-ray
regime through to the radio part of the spectrum. THINGS data can be used to
investigate issues such as the small-scale structure of the ISM, its
three-dimensional structure, the (dark) matter distribution and processes
leading to star formation. To demonstrate the quality of the THINGS data
products, we present some prelimary HI maps here of four galaxies from the

Our analysis is motivated by the temperature sensitivity of the nuclear energy
generation rate ($\sim T^{23}$) in a white dwarf whose structural adiabatic
index is near 4/3. Based upon a linear stability analysis, we find that the
fundamental mode and higher order radial modes are indeed unstable and that the
fundamental mode has the shortest growth time scale. However, the growth time
scale for such instability never becomes shorter than the evolutionary
timescale. Therefore, even though the star \emph{is} pulsationally unstable, we
do not expect these radial modes to have time to grow and to affect the

scalar-field Lagrangian, which has a general dependence on the field itself and
its first derivatives, dominates in the flat Friedmann universe, we analyze the
possibility of a dynamical transition from the states with w>-1 to those with
w<-1 or vice versa. We have found that generally such transitions are
physically implausible because they are either realized by a discrete set of
trajectories in the phase space or are unstable with respect to the
cosmological perturbations. This conclusion is confirmed by a comparison of the
analytic results with numerical solutions obtained for simple models. Without
the assumption of the dark energy domination, this result still holds for a
certain class of dark energy Lagrangians, in particular, for Lagrangians
quadratic in field's first derivatives. The result is insensitive to topology
of the Friedmann universe as well.

general, ``blind'' approaches to source separation do not assume any knowledge

separation approaches, where mutual independence between the sources is
assumed, our method only needs to constrain second-order statistics, and is
effective even if the original sources are significantly correlated. Besides
the mixing matrix, our strategy is also capable to evaluate the source
covariance functions at several lags. Moreover, once the mixing parameters have
been identified, a simple deconvolution can be used to estimate the probability
density functions of the source processes. To benchmark our algorithm, we used
a database that simulates the one expected from the instruments that will
operate onboard ESA's Planck Surveyor Satellite to measure the CMB anisotropies
all over the celestial sphere. The assumption was made that the emission
spectra of the galactic foregrounds can be parametrised, thus reducing the
number of unknowns for system identification to the number of the foreground
radiations. We performed separation in several sky patches, featuring different
levels of galactic contamination to the CMB, and assuming several noise levels,
including the ones derived from the Planck specifications.

of elliptical-like objects (ELOs) identified at z=0 in four simulations
operating in the context of a concordance cosmological model. The simulations
show that the formation of most stars in each ELO of the sample is a
consequence of violent dynamical events, either fast multiclump collapse at
high z, or mergers at lower z. This second way can explain the age spread as
well as the dynamical peculiarities observed in some ellipticals, but its
relative weight is never dominant and decreases as the ELO mass at the halo
scale, $M_{vir}$, increases, to such an extent that some recent mergers
contributing an important fraction to the total ELO mass can possibly
contribute only a small fraction of new born stars. More massive objects have
older means and narrower spreads in their stellar age distributions than less
massive ones. The ELO sample shows also a tight correlation between $M_{vir}$
and the central stellar l.o.s. velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{los}$. This gives
a trend of the means and spreads of ELO stellar populations with $\sigma_{los}$
that is consistent, even quantitatively, with the age effects observationally
detected in the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies. Therefore, these
effects can be explained as the observational manifestation of the intrinsic
correlations found in the ELO sample between $M_{vir}$ and the properties of
the stellar age distribution, on the one hand, and $M_{vir}$ and
$\sigma_{los}$, on the other hand. These correlations hint, for the first time,
at a possible way to reconcile age effects in ellipticals, and, particularly,
the increase of $\alpha / <Fe>$ ratios with $\sigma_{los}$, with the
hierarchical clustering paradigm.

easy and depends on their different symmetries. The distinction between a
classical glass and a classical liquid is more difficult, since the glass is
also disordered. The difference is in the fact that a glass is frozen while the
liquid is not. In this article an equilibrium measure is suggested that
distinguishes between a glass and a liquid. The choice of this measure is based
on the idea that in a system which is not frozen symmetry under permutation of
particles is physically relevant, because particles can be permuted by actual
physical motion. This is not the case in a frozen system. In quantum Bose
systems there is a natural parameter that can distinguish between a frozen and
a non-frozen state. This is the Bose condensed fraction. In this article it is
shown how to generalize this concept, in a natural way, to classical systems in
order to distinguish between the glass and the liquid. A formal similarity
between the ground state wave function of a Bose system and the statistical
weight function enables a definition of a Bose Einstein condensed fraction in
classical systems. It is finite in the liquid and zero in the frozen state. The
actual value of the condensed fraction in the liquid may serve also as a
measure of the glassiness in the liquid. The smaller it is the larger the
glassiness of the liquid.

$\Omega \gtrsim \omega_\perp$, the condensate contains a dense vortex array

has a classical Higgs branch that is a complex deformation of the orbifold
C^3/Z_n x Z_n that is a non-compact Calabi-Yau space with isolated conifold
singularities. At these singular points in moduli space the theory exhibits a
duality cascade and flows to a confining theory with a mass gap. By exactly
solving the corresponding holomorphic matrix model we compute the exact quantum
superpotential generated at the end of the duality cascade and calculate
precisely how quantum effects deform the classical moduli space by replacing
the conifold singularities with three-cycles of finite size. Locally the
structure is that of the deformed conifold, but the global geometry is
different. This desingularized quantum deformed geometry is the moduli space of
probe D3-branes at the end of a duality cascade realized on the worldvolume of
(fractional) D3-branes placed at the isolated conifold singularities in the

suggested that Hawking information loss, associated with the transition from a
pure to a mixed quantum state, is compensated for by the creation of deviations
from Born-rule probabilities outside the event horizon. The resulting states
have non-standard or 'nonequilibrium' distributions of hidden variables, with a
specific observable signature - a breakdown of the sinusoidal modulation of
quantum probabilities for two-state systems. Outgoing Hawking radiation is
predicted to contain statistical anomalies outside the domain of the quantum
formalism. Further, it is argued that even for a macroscopic black hole, if one
half of an entangled EPR-pair should fall behind the event horizon, the other
half will develop similar statistical anomalies. We propose a simple rule,
whereby the relative entropy of the nonequilibrum (hidden-variable)
distribution generated outside the horizon balances the increase in von Neumann
entropy associated with the pure-to-mixed transition. It is argued that there
are relationships between hidden-variable and von Neumann entropies even in
non-gravitational physics. We consider the possibility of observing anomalous
polarisation probabilities, in the radiation from primordial black holes, and
in the atomic cascade emission of entangled photon pairs from black-hole

hole and a kind of q-deformed degrees of freedom are postulated to mimic the

It is in between the chromatic and fractional chromatic numbers. This motivates
the study of the local chromatic number of graphs for which these quantities
are far apart. Such graphs include Kneser graphs, their vertex color-critical
subgraphs, the Schrijver (or stable Kneser) graphs; Mycielski graphs, and their
generalizations; and Borsuk graphs. We give more or less tight bounds for the
local chromatic number of many of these graphs.
  We use an old topological result of Ky Fan which generalizes the Borsuk-Ulam
theorem. It implies the existence of a multicolored copy of the balanced
complete bipartite graph on t points in every proper coloring of many graphs
whose chromatic number t is determined via a topological argument. (This was in
particular noted for Kneser graphs by Ky Fan.) This yields a lower bound of
t/2+1 for the local chromatic number of these graphs. We show this bound to be
tight or almost tight in many cases.
  As another consequence of the above we prove that the graphs considered here
have equal circular and ordinary chromatic numbers if the latter is even. This
partially proves a conjecture of Johnson, Holroyd, and Stahl and was
independently attained by F. Meunier. We also show that odd chromatic Schrijver
graphs behave differently, their circular chromatic number can be arbitrarily
close to the other extreme.

classes of line-bundle-valued quadratic forms on rank 3 vector bundles upto
tensoring by twisted discriminant bundles and the set of isomorphism classes of
schematic specialisations of rank 4 Azumaya bundles over any fixed scheme X.
This statement is a limiting version of the following statement: the set of
orbits of Disc(X) in the 1-cohomology of X in the fppf topology with values in
O(3) is in bijection with the 1-cohomology with values in PGL(2). The various

the subgroup of automorphisms with trivial determinant. A specialised algebra
arises from a honest quadratic form iff its determinant has a square root and
arises from a bilinear form iff the line subbundle generated by 1 is a direct

quadrupole and octupole collective modes in heavy spherical nuclei. Within this

giant resonances has been achieved by introducing a coupling between surface
vibrations and the motion of single nucleons. Analytical expressions for the
collective response functions of different multipolarity can be derived by
using a separable approximation for the residual interaction between nucleons.
The response functions obtained in this way give a good qualitative description
of the quadrupole and octupole response in heavy nuclei. Although shell effects
are not explicitly included in the theory, our semiclassical response functions
are very similar to the quantum ones. This happens because of the well known
close relation between classical trajectories and shell structure. The role
played by particular nucleon trajectories and their connection with various
features of the nuclear response is displayed most clearly in the present
approach, we discuss in some detail the damping of low-energy octupole
vibrations and give an explicit expression showing that only nucleons moving on
triangular orbits can contribute to this damping.

Schr\""odinger Equation (SSE) given in ref. \cite{Jul02}. A stochastic
Liouville-von Neumann equation is derived as well as the associated

of the many-body density along the path, the presented theory is equivalent to
a stochastic theory in one-body density matrix space, in which each density
matrix evolves according to its own mean field augmented by a one-body noise.
Guided by the exact reformulation, a stochastic mean field dynamics valid in
the weak coupling approximation is proposed. This theory leads to an
approximate treatment of two-body effects similar to the extended
Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (Extended TDHF) scheme. In this stochastic mean
field dynamics, statistical mixing can be directly considered and jumps occur
on a coarse-grained time scale. Accordingly, numerical effort is expected to be

over collective-noise channel. By adding one extra photon with a fixed
polarization, we can protect the state against collective noise via a
parity-check measurement and post-selection. While the scheme succeeds only
probabilistically, it is simpler and more flexible than the schemes utilizing
decoherence-free subspace. An application to BB84 protocol through collective
noise channel, which is robust to the Trojan horse attack, is also given.

Phys., Vol. 252 (2004), 543-579","10.1007/s00220-004-1188-2",,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  We compute the entropy of entanglement in the ground states of a general
class of quantum spin-chain Hamiltonians - those that are related to quadratic
forms of Fermi operators - between the first N spins and the rest of the system
in the limit of infinite total chain length. We show that the entropy can be
expressed in terms of averages over the classical compact groups and establish
an explicit correspondence between the symmetries of a given Hamiltonian and
those characterizing the Haar measure of the associated group. These averages
are either Toeplitz determinants or determinants of combinations of Toeplitz
and Hankel matrices. Recent generalizations of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture
are used to compute the leading order asymptotics of the entropy as N -->
infinity . This is shown to grow logarithmically with N. The constant of
proportionality is determined explicitly, as is the next (constant) term in the
asymptotic expansion. The logarithmic growth of the entropy was previously
predicted on the basis of numerical computations and conformal-field-theoretic
calculations. In these calculations the constant of proportionality was
determined in terms of the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Our results
therefore lead to an explicit formula for this charge. We also show that the
entropy is related to solutions of ordinary differential equations of
Painlev\'e type. In some cases these solutions can be evaluated to all orders
using recurrence relations.

in optical lattices. These setups allow unprecedented quantum control over
large numbers of atoms and thus are very promising for applications in quantum
information processing. After introducing optical lattices we discuss the
superfluid (SF) and Mott insulating (MI) states of neutral atoms trapped in
such lattices and investigate the SF-MI transition as recently observed
experimentally. In the second part of the paper we give an overview of
proposals for quantum information processing and show different ways to
entangle the trapped atoms, in particular the usage of cold collisions and
Rydberg atoms. Finally, we also briefly discuss the implementation of quantum
simulators, entanglement enhanced atom interferometers, and ideas for robust
quantum memory in optical lattices.
