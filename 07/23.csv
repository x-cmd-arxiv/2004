stellar objects (YSOs) located in the Taurus and Ophiuchus clouds to search for
companions. The sample includes Class I and flat infrared spectrum protostellar
objects. We find 17 companions physically bound to 15 YSOs with angular
separations in the range 0.8-10"" (110-1400 AU) and derive a companion star
fraction of 23+/-9 % and 29+/-7 % for embedded YSOs in Taurus and Ophiuchus,
respectively. In spite of different properties of the clouds and especially of
the prestellar cores, the fraction of wide companions, 27+/-6 % for the
combined sample, is identical in the two star-forming regions. This suggests
that the frequency and properties of wide multiple protostellar systems are not
very sensitive to specific initial conditions. Comparing the companion star
fraction of the youngest YSOs still surrounded by extended envelopes to that of
more evolved YSOs, we find evidence for a possible evolution of the fraction of
wide multiple systems, which seems to decrease by a factor of about 2 on a
timescale of about 10^5 yr. Somewhat contrary to model predictions, we do not
find evidence for a sub-clustering of embedded sources at this stage on a scale
of a few 100 AU that could be related to the formation of small-N protostellar
clusters. Possible interpretations for this discrepancy are discussed.

galaxies, have heated the diffuse hot gas in clusters. The first is the general
need for additional heating to explain the steepness of the X-ray
luminosity--temperature relation in clusters, the second is to solve the
cooling flow problem in cluster cores. The inner core of many clusters is
radiating energy as X-rays on a timescale much shorter than its likely age.
Although the temperature in this region drops by a factor of about 3 from that
of the surrounding gas, little evidence is found for gas much cooler than that.
Some form of heating appears to be taking place, probably by energy transported
outward from the central accreting black hole or radio source. How that energy
heats the gas depends on poorly understood transport properties (conductivity
and viscosity) of the intracluster medium. Viscous heating is discussed as a
possibility. Such heating processes have consequences for the truncation of the
luminosity function of massive galaxies.

The inferred surface densities of $z\simeq 6$ galaxies are consistent with our

for detection incompleteness, the counts of $z\simeq 6$ candidates to

-1.9, which is sufficient to account for the entire Lyman photon budget

wavelengths from dust grains in interstellar clouds with irregular magnetic
fields is simulated. We show that the polarization properties of quiescent
clouds and of star-forming regions are consistent with Kolmogorov-like
turbulent magnetic fields that are comparable in magnitude to the uniform
component of the magnetic fields. If the beam size is much smaller than the
correlation length $L_{\rm corr}$ of the fields, the calculated percentage
polarization $p$ decreases to an asymptotic value when the number of
correlation lengths $N_{\rm corr}$ through the cloud exceeds a few tens. For
these values of $N_{\rm corr}$, the dispersion in the position angles
$\sigma_\alpha$ is still appreciable--decreasing to only about $20^{\circ}$.
However, when the finite size of a telescope beam is taken into account, the
asymptotic value of $p$ is reached for fewer correlation lengths (smaller
$N_{\rm corr}$) due to averaging over the beam; $\sigma_\alpha$ becames much
smaller and consistent with the observational data. The smoothing of the
polarization properties due to the combined effect of the thickness of the
cloud and the finite size of the beam can be described by a single variable
which we designate as the generalized number of correlation lengths. In
addition, we study various factors that may contribute to the decrease in the
linear polarization percentage with increasing intensity that is observed at
submillimeter and far infrared wavelengths in many, though not in all, dark
clouds (the ""polarization hole"" effect).

centers or, more easily, detecting periodic behavior in the observed radio
light curves. In a recent paper, Sudou et al. \cite{sudou2003} announced the
first direct observation of an SMBHB. Using VLBI observations they found that
the unresolved radio core of the radio galaxy 3C66B shows a well defined
elliptical motion with a period of $1.05\pm 0.03$ yrs, implying the presence of
a couple of massive black holes in the center of the galaxy. In the present

detecting a signal periodicity either in the $X$-ray and/or $\gamma$-ray light
curves as a consequence of the motion of the black holes. These observations
could be used to extract further information on the physical parameters of the
SMBHB and partially solve the system parameter degeneracy. The detection of the

Gyr. Taking into account the uncertainties on the velocity components, we infer
an average peculiar velocity of 183 \pm 31 km/s. The maximum velocity which the
binary can acquire by symmetric supernova mass loss is about 100 km/s, which is
2.7 sigma away from the mean of the peculiar velocity distribution. We
therefore argue that an additional asymmetric kick velocity is required. By
considering the orientation of the system relative to the plane of the sky, we
derive a 95% probability for a non null component of the kick perpendicular to
the orbital plane of the binary. The distribution of perpendicular velocities
is skewed to lower velocities with an average of 93^{+55}_{-60} km/s.

spectrum. For scattering by whistler wave turbulence, STFA produces a
quasi-thermal spectrum. A second well-constrained scattering mechanism is
needed for STFA to match the observed 10-100keV non-thermal spectrum. We
suggest that STFA most plausibly acts as phase one of a two phase particle
acceleration engine in impulsive flares: STFA can match the thermal spectrum
below 10kev, and possibly the power law spectrum between 10 and 100keV, given
the proper pitch angle scattering. However, a second phase, such as shock
acceleration at loop tops, is likely required to match the spectrum above the
observed knee at 100keV. Understanding this knee, if it survives further

because his instruments change in identical proportions. The same principle was
derived from a new gravitational theory based on a particle model made up of

the classical hypotheses on the relative invariability of the bodies after a
change of GP and with the G field energy hypothesis. The two kinds of errors
are of the same magnitude and opposite signs. Such errors are cancelled but
only when the two hypotheses are used. This accounts for the good predictions

tensor in the dS invariant vacuum for an effectively massless scalar
($m_\eff^2=m^2+\xi {\cal R}=0$ with ${\cal R}$ the Ricci scalar) is infrared
divergent except for the minimally coupled case. The usual procedure to tame
this divergence is to replace the dS invariant vacuum by the Allen Follaci (AF)
vacuum. The resulting stress tensor breaks dS symmetry but is regular.
Similarly, in the brane world context, we find that the dS invariant vacuum
generates $\tmn$ divergent everywhere when the lowest lying mode becomes
massless except for massless minimal coupling case. A simple extension of the
AF vacuum to the present case avoids this global divergence, but $\tmn$ remains
to be divergent along a timelike axis in the bulk. In this case, singularities
also appear along the light cone emanating from the origin in the bulk,
although they are so mild that $\tmn$ stays finite except for non-minimal
coupling cases in four or six dimensions. We discuss implications of these
results for bulk inflaton models. We also study the evolution of the field
perturbations in dS brane world. We find that perturbations grow linearly with
time on the brane, as in the case of ordinary dS space. In the bulk, they are

data in a slightly complexified time-interval $T={\tau}{\exp}(-i{\theta})$ at
infinity is approximately $\exp(-I)$, where $I$ is the (complex) Euclidean
action of the classical solution filling in between the boundary data. And in a
locally supersymmetric (supergravity) theory, the amplitude const. exp(-I) is
exact. Dirichlet boundary data for gravity and the scalar field are posed on an
initial spacelike hypersurface extending to spatial infinity, just prior to
collapse, and on a corresponding final spacelike surface, sufficiently far to
the future of the initial surface to catch all the Hawking radiation. In an
averaged sense this radiation has an approximately spherically-symmetric
distribution. If the time-interval $T$ were exactly real, the resulting
`hyperbolic Dirichlet boundary-value problem' would not be well posed. If
instead (`Euclidean strategy'), one takes $T$ complex, as above
($0<\theta{\leq}{\pi}/2$), the field equations become strongly elliptic, with a
unique solution to the classical boundary-value problem. Expanding the bosonic
part of the action to quadratic order in perturbations about the classical
solution gives the quantum amplitude for weak-field final configurations, up to
normalization. Such amplitudes are calculated for weak final scalar fields.

still necessary as well as an increase of the experimental capabilities;

cease to percolate. We further demonstrate that thin center vortices have a
special geometrical status in gauge-field configuration space: Thin vortices

essential tool for quantum communication, especially suited for long-distance
connections. To have a reasonable count rate after all the losses in the
propagation and the filters needed to improve the coherence, it is convenient
to increase the intensity of the laser that pumps the non-linear crystal. By
doing so, however, the importance of the four-photon component of the
down-converted field increases, thus degrading the quality of two-photon
interferences. In this paper, we present an easy derivation of this nuisance
valid for any form of entanglement generated by down-conversion, followed by a
full study of the problem for time-bin entanglement. We find that the
visibility of two-photon interferences decreases as V=1-2\rho, where \rho is,
in usual situations, the probability per pulse of creating a detectable photon
pair. In particular, the decrease of V is independent of the coherence of the
four-photon term. Thanks to the fact that \rho can be measured independently of
V, the experimental verification of our prediction is provided for two
different configuration of filters.
