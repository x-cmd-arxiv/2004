elliptical galaxies has both prevented large-scale cooling flows and assisted
in the expulsion of metal rich gas. We now know that each such spheroidal
system harbors in its core a massive black hole weighing approximately 0.13% of
the mass in stars and also know that energy was emitted by each of these black
holes with an efficiency exceeding 10% of its rest mass. Since, if only 0.5% of
that radiant energy were intercepted by the ambient gas, its thermal state
would be drastically altered, it is worth examining in detail the interaction
between the out-flowing radiation and the equilibrium or inflowing gas. On the
basis of detailed hydrodynamic computations we find that relaxation
oscillations are to be expected with the radiative feedback quite capable of
regulating both the growth of the central black hole and also the density and
thermal state of the gas in the galaxy. Mechanical input of energy by jets may
assist or dominate over these radiative effects. We propose specific
observational tests to identify systems which have experienced strong bursts of
radiative heating from their central black holes.

survey is to quantify the potential impact on QSO absorber statistics from dust
in intervening galaxies. Dust may introduce a selection bias in surveys which
are based on magnitude limited QSO samples, leading to an underestimate of
absorber number density, n(z). Here we present the results of the second phase
of the CORALS survey which extends our previous work on z > 1.8 damped Lyman
alpha systems (DLAs) to search for strong metal line systems (candidate DLAs)
in the range 0.6 < z < 1.7. We have identified 47 MgII systems with rest frame
equivalent widths EW(MgII lambda 2796) > 0.3 A in our sample of 75
radio-selected quasars. Our principal and most robust result is that the n(z)
of low redshift MgII systems determined for the CORALS survey is in excellent
agreement with that of optically-selected, magnitude limited QSO samples. The
statistically inferred number density of DLAs, n(z)=0.16^+0.08_-0.06, is
consistent with other low redshift samples, although the large 1 sigma error
bars permit up to a factor of 2.5 more DLAs in CORALS. However, confirmation of
the DLA candidates, precise evaluation of their n(z) and measurement of their
HI column densities awaits UV observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Finally, we report an excess of intermediate redshift MgII systems observed
towards bright QSOs which could be due to a lensing amplification bias.
However, there is also evidence that this excess could simply be due to more
sensitive EW detection limits towards brighter QSOs. We also emphasize that
absorber statistics determined from magnitude limited surveys reach a steady
value if the completeness limit is significantly fainter than the fiducial
value of the quasar luminosity function. (Abridged).

A363 (2005) 739-749","10.1098/rsta.2004.1520",,"astro-ph",,"  In cuspy atmospheres, jets driven by supermassive black holes (BHs) offset
radiative cooling. The jets fire episodically, but often enough that the cuspy
atmosphere does not move very far towards a cooling catastrophe in the
intervals of jet inactivity. The ability of energy released on the sub-parsec
scale of the BH to balance cooling on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs
arises through a combination of the temperature sensitivity of the accretion
rate and the way in which the radius of jet disruption varies with ambient
density. Accretion of hot gas does not significantly increase BH masses, which
are determined by periods of rapid BH growth and star formation when cold gas
is briefly abundant at the galactic centre. Hot gas does not accumulate in
shallow potential wells. As the Universe ages, deeper wells form, and
eventually hot gas accumulates. This gas soon prevents the formation of further
stars, since jets powered by the BH prevent it from cooling, and it mops up
most cold infalling gas before many stars can form. Thus BHs set the upper
limit to the masses of galaxies. The formation of low-mass galaxies is
inhibited by a combination of photo-heating and supernova-driven galactic
winds. Working in tandem these mechanisms can probably explain the profound
difference between the galaxy luminosity function and the mass function of dark
halos expected in the cold dark matter cosmology.

they are recent galaxy mergers in which much of the gas in the former spiral
disks, particularly that located at distances less than 5 kpc from each of the
pre-merger nuclei, has fallen into a common center, triggering a huge starburst
phenomenon. This large nuclear concentration of molecular gas has been detected
by many groups, and estimates of molecular mass and density have been made. Not
surprisingly, these estimates were found to be orders of magnitude larger than
the corresponding values found in our Galaxy. In this paper, a self-consistent
model of the high energy emission of the super-starburst galaxy Arp 220 is
presented. The model also provides an estimate of the radio emission from each
of the components of the central region of the galaxy (western and eastern
extreme starbursts, and molecular disk). The predicted radio spectrum is found
as a result of the synchrotron and free-free emission, and absorption, of the
primary and secondary steady population of electrons and positrons. The latter
is output of charged pion decay and knock-on leptonic production, subject to a
full set of losses in the interstellar medium. The resulting radio spectrum is
in agreement with sub-arcsec radio observations, what allows to estimate the
magnetic field. In addition, the FIR emission is modeled with dust emissivity,
and the computed FIR photon density is used as a target for inverse Compton
process as well as to give account of losses in the $\gamma$-ray scape.
Bremsstrahlung emission and neutral pion decay are also computed, and the

To properly include relativistic radiation drag, the radiation hydrodynamic

optical depth of the cloud. As a result, it is found that the optically-thin
surface layers are effectively stripped by radiation drag from an
optically-thick gas cloud, and simultaneously stripped gas loses momentum. The
momentum loss time-scale is found to be on the order of $10^{8}$ years under
intensive radiation fields which are expected in the early phase of galaxy

mechanism to extract angular momentum from interstellar medium and allows it to
accrete onto the galactic center. The mass accretion driven by radiation drag

survey of X-ray luminous galaxy clusters conducted with the wide field CFH12k

determination of the ""true"" shape of faint (lensed) galaxies which involves:
object detection strategy, point spread function (PSF) determination, galaxy
shapes measurements with errors; (2) conversion of the faint galaxies catalogue
into useful mass constraints which is done by different lensing techniques
using 1D and/or 2D mass estimates. Finally, we compare the cluster mass model
to the light distribution of cluster members as observed on our imaging data.
To illustrate the method, we apply it to the well studied cluster Abell 1689
(z=0.184). In this cluster, we detect the gravitational shear signal to the
edge of the image at 3 sigma significance. The two-dimensional mass
reconstruction has a ~10 sigma significance mass peak centered on the brightest
cluster galaxy. The weak lensing constraints are well fitted by a NFW mass
profile with $M_{200} = 14.1^{+6.3}_{-4.7}\times 10^{14} M_\sun$, and $c =
3.5^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ (chi^2=0.33), or by a power law (PL) profile with q=0.75 +-

to be almost constant with radius with a mean value of M/L_R = 150 h

massive binary can effect a reversal of the end states of the two components,
resulting in a neutron star which forms before a black hole. In this sense,
such systems would comprise the high-mass analogues of white dwarf-neutron star
systems such as PSR B2303+46. One consequence of this reversal is that a second
episode of mass transfer from the black hole progenitor star can recycle the
nascent neutron star, extending the life of the pulsar.
  An estimate of the formation rate through this channel is first performed via
a simple analytical approach, and then refined using the results of the SeBa
binary evolution package. The central role of kicks in determining the survival
rate of these binaries is clearly demonstrated. The final result is expressed
in terms of the number of field pulsars one can expect for every single neutron
star-black hole (ns,bh) binary. We also calculate this figure for black
hole-neutron star (bh,ns) systems formed through the usual channel. Assuming

  Abstract abridged","Astron.Astrophys. 426 (2004) 677-686","10.1051/0004-6361:20041029",,"astro-ph",,"  Using new techniques based on the polarimetric fluctuation spectrum, the
fluctuation behaviour of the polarization of individual pulses is examined in
three pulsars that show drifting subpulses, allowing various aspects of the
fluctuations to be quantified for the first time. Of the three pulsars studied,
only PSR B0809+74 shows behaviour completely consistent with the superposition
of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), and this only at 328 MHz and in
superposition with an apparently randomly polarized component. The observed
periodic pattern is decomposed into the sum of two orthogonally polarized,
out-of-phase drift patterns, one of which shows a dramatic jump in subpulse
phase near the leading edge of the pulse window. For PSR B0320+39 and PSR
B0818$-$13, considerable periodic fluctuations away from OPM orientations are
seen, a condition that also occurs in the trailing half of the pulse in PSR
B0809+74 at 1380 MHz. In some cases the deviation is so strong that the
periodic locus of the polarization vector in the Poincar\'{e} sphere is almost
circular, in contrast to the strictly colinear states of superposed OPMs.
Several possibilities are discussed for the physical origin of these patterns.
The similarity between the subpulse patterns in one of the OPMs of PSR B0809+74
at 328 MHz to that of the total intensity signal at 1380 MHz supports a picture
of superposed, out of phase drift patterns. To explain the full range of
behaviour seen in the three pulsars, it must be possible to produce at least
three arbitrarily polarized superposed patterns. While the data do not suggest
a particular approach for the empirical decomposition of patterns into
non-orthogonally polarized components, the specific, quantitative nature of the
results should provide strong constraints for theoretically driven modelling.

sub-gap phonon emission. The qps can acquire sufficient energy to emit phonons,
which break more Cooper pairs and release additional qps. In this paper we
report theoretical and experimental studies of the effect of this process on
photon detection by such an STJ. We derived a set of energy-dependent balance

show quasiparticle loss times varying between 5 and 80 usec, depending on the
device size. The bias range of the Nb-contacted junctions is limited to the
range 0-100 uV, because of the set-in of strong non-equilibrium quasiparticle
multiplication currents at higher bias voltages. The Ta-contacted junctions, on

loss times lead to very strong quasiparticle multiplication, which prevents the
stable biasing of the junctions even at very low bias voltages. Junction

substantially by replacing the floating poly-Si gate by a layer of Si dots.
This multi-dot layer can be fabricated CMOS-compatibly in very thin gate oxide
by ion beam synthesis (IBS). Here, we present both experimental and theoretical
studies on IBS of multi-dot layers consisting of Si nanocrystals (NCs). The NCs
are produced by ultra low energy Si ion implantation, which causes a high Si
supersaturation in the shallow implantation region. During post-implantation
annealing, this supersaturation leads to phase separation of the excess Si from
the SiO2. Till now, the study of this phase separation process suffered from
the weak Z contrast between Si and SiO2 in Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM). Here, this imaging problem is resolved by mapping Si plasmon losses with
a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy equipped with a parallel Electron
Energy Loss Spectroscopy system (PEELS-STEM). Additionally, kinetic lattice
Monte Carlo simulations of Si phase separation have been performed and compared
with the experimental Si plasmon maps. It has been predicted theoretically that
the morphology of the multi-dot Si floating-gate changes with increasing ion
fluence from isolated, spherical NCs to percolated spinodal Si pattern. These
patterns agree remarkably with PEELS-STEM images. However, the predicted
fluence for spinodal patterns is lower than the experimental one. Because
oxidants of the ambient atmosphere penetrate into the as-implanted SiO2, a
substantial fraction of the implanted Si might be lost due to oxidation.

(non-proper) edge $k$-colouring such that between each pair of colour classes
no two monochromatic edges cross. This structure has recently arisen in the
study of three-dimensional graph drawings. This paper presents the beginnings
of a theory of track layouts. First we determine the maximum number of edges in
a $(k,t)$-track layout, and show how to colour the edges given fixed linear
orderings of the vertex colour classes. We then describe methods for the
manipulation of track layouts. For example, we show how to decrease the number
of edge colours in a track layout at the expense of increasing the number of
tracks, and vice versa. We then study the relationship between track layouts
and other models of graph layout, namely stack and queue layouts, and geometric
thickness. One of our principle results is that the queue-number and
track-number of a graph are tied, in the sense that one is bounded by a
function of the other. As corollaries we prove that acyclic chromatic number is
bounded by both queue-number and stack-number. Finally we consider track
layouts of planar graphs. While it is an open problem whether planar graphs
have bounded track-number, we prove bounds on the track-number of outerplanar
graphs, and give the best known lower bound on the track-number of planar
graphs.

relative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the
planetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the
nodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the
order of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies
just at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing
the planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and
BepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main
sources of systematic errors. They are the aliasing classical precessions
induced by the multipolar expansion of the Sun's gravitational potential and
the classical secular N-body precessions which are of the same order of
magnitude or much larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions of interest. This
definitely rules out the possibility of analyzing only one orbital element of,
e.g., Mercury. In order to circumvent these problems, we propose a suitable
linear combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes of Mercury, Venus and
Mars which is, by construction, independent of such classical secular
precessions. A 1-sigma reasonable estimate of the obtainable accuracy yields a
36% error. Since the major role in the proposed combination is played by the
Mercury's node, it could happen that the new, more accurate ephemerides
available in future thanks to the Messenger and BepiColombo missions will offer
an opportunity to improve the present unfavorable situation.

The heterotic string model is based on the free--fermionic formalism. This is
the first case where non--Abelian VEV's, as opposed to singlet VEV's are
required for the cancellation of the Fayet--Iliopoulos term. It is noted that
non--Abelian fields are the only fields that can give rise to the satisfaction
of the D--flat constraints in this model.
  The type I models are based on T^6/Z_2x(Z_2)^s and T^6/Z_2xZ_2x(Z_2)^s
compactifications. The first example has N=2 supersymmetry and includes a rank
reduction of the D5 gauge groups as a result of using a freely acting Kaluza
Klein shift Z_2^s. The second case is an N=1 model. One has a choice of sign
epsilon=+/-1 from terms not related to the principle orbits by S and T
transformations. This allows the breaking of supersymmetry with the
introduction of antibranes. For epsilon=-1 there is a problem with respect to

tadpole complications for the g and f twisted sectors, but allows the h twisted

circle M^d x S^1, and map it to a corresponding solution for a near-extremal

U-duality transformation on the Kaluza-Klein black hole, transforming it to a

Sasaki (SMS) in the framework of the Gauss-Codazzi projective approach with the
subsequent specialization to the Gaussian normal coordinates in the
neighborhood of the brane. However, the Gaussian normal coordinates imply a
very special slicing of spacetime and clearly, the consistent analysis of the
brane dynamics would benefit from complete freedom in the slicing of spacetime,
pushing the layer surfaces in the fifth dimension at any rates of evolution and
in arbitrary positions. We generalize the SMS effective field equations on and
off a 3-brane to the case where there is an arbitrary energy-momentum tensor in
the bulk. We use a more general setting to allow for acceleration of the
normals to the brane surface through the lapse function and the shift vector in
the spirit of Arnowitt, Deser and Misner. We show that the gravitational
influence of the bulk spacetime on the brane may be described by a traceless
second-rank tensor W_{ij}, constructed from the ""electric"" part of the bulk
Riemann tensor. We also present the evolution equations for the tensor W_{ij},

Yang-Mills theory can be vastly simplified by mapping the dilatation generator
to the Hamiltonian of an integrable spin chain. The Bethe ansatz has been used
in this context to compute the spectra of spin chains associated with various
sectors of the theory which are known to decouple in the planar (large-N_c)
limit. These techniques are powerful at leading order in perturbation theory
but become increasingly complicated beyond one loop in the 't Hooft parameter
lambda=g_YM^2 N_c, where spin chains typically acquire long-range
(non-nearest-neighbor) interactions. In certain sectors of the theory,
moreover, higher-loop Bethe ansaetze do not even exist. We develop a virial
expansion of the spin chain Hamiltonian as an alternative to the Bethe ansatz
methodology, a method which simplifies the computation of dimensions of
multi-impurity operators at higher loops in lambda. We use these methods to
extract previously reported numerical gauge theory predictions near the BMN
limit for comparison with corresponding results on the string theory side of
the AdS/CFT correspondence. For completeness, we compare our virial results
with predictions that can be derived from current Bethe ansatz technology.

  127-137","10.1142/9789812775061_0008",,"math.AG math.AP",,"  The sheaf of rings of WKB operators provides a deformation-quantization of
the cotangent bundle to a complex manifold. On a complex symplectic manifold
$X$ there may not exist a sheaf of rings locally isomorphic to a ring of WKB
operators. The idea is then to consider the whole family of locally defined
sheaves of WKB operators as the deformation-quantization of $X$. To state it
precisely, one needs the notion of algebroid stack, introduced by Kontsevich.
In particular, the stack of WKB modules over $X$ defined in Polesello-Schapira
(see also Kashiwara for the contact case) is better understood as the stack of
modules over the algebroid stack of deformation-quantization of $X$.
  Let $V$ be an involutive submanifold of $X$, and assume for simplicity that
the quotient of $V$ by its bicharacteristic leaves is isomorphic to a complex
symplectic manifold $Z$. The algebra of endomorphisms of a simple WKB module
along $V$ is locally (anti-)isomorphic to the pull-back of WKB operators on
$Z$. Hence we may say that a simple module provides a deformation-quantization
of $V$. Again, since in general there do not exist globally defined simple WKB
modules, the idea is to consider the algebroid stack of locally defined simple
WKB modules as the deformation-quantization of $V$.
  In this paper we start by defining what an algebroid stack is, and how it is
locally described. We then discuss the algebroid stack of WKB operators on a
complex symplectic manifold $X$, and define the deformation-quantization of an
involutive submanifold $V$ by means of simple WKB modules along $V$. Finally,
we relate this deformation-quantization to that given by WKB operators on the
quotient of $V$ by its bicharacteristic leaves.

achieve with existing materials. Here we present a structured metamaterial,
based on conducting split ring resonators (SRRs), which has an effective
index-of-refraction with a constant spatial gradient. We experimentally confirm
the gradient by measuring the deflection of a microwave beam by a planar slab
of the composite metamaterial over a broad range of frequencies. The gradient
index metamaterial represents an alternative approach to the development of
gradient index lenses and similar optics that may be advantageous, especially
at higher frequencies. In particular, the gradient index material we propose
may be suited for terahertz applications, where the magnetic resonant response
of SRRs has recently been demonstrated.

collision frequency shift. By using a method based on a transfer of population
by adiabatic passage allowing to prepare cold atomic samples with a well

controlled at the 10E-3 of its value. A calibration of Zeeman sub-states

Feshbach resonances have been observed for the first time at very low magnetic

performed and could fit properly some of experimental data. This constrains
some parameters of the theory of collisions.

of low clouds has recently been found for the past 20 years. However, of the
physical explanations suggested, none has been quantitatively verified in the
atmosphere by a combination of modelling and experiment. Here we study the
relation between the global distributions of the observed low cloud amount and
the calculated tropospheric ionization induced by cosmic rays. We find that the
time evolution of the low cloud amount can be decomposed into a long-term trend
and inter-annual variations, the latter depicting a clear 11-year cycle. We
also find that the relative inter-annual variability in low cloud amount
increases polewards and exhibits a highly significant one-to-one relation with
inter-annual variations in the ionization over the latitude range
20--55$^\circ$S and 10--70$^\circ$N. This latitudinal dependence gives strong
support for the hypothesis that the cosmic ray induced ionization modulates
cloud properties.

Nevertheless, their form is similar to that of completely positive maps. Only
some minus signs are inserted in the operator-sum representation. Each map is
the difference of two completely positive maps. The maps are first obtained as
maps of mean values and then as maps of basis matrices. These forms also prove
to be useful. An example for two entangled qubits is worked out in detail.
Relation to earlier work is discussed.

that the bound state levels of an atom become resonances (spectral
enhancements) in the continuum in the presence of an electric field (in all

states in the extended Lax-Phillips Hilbert space. We show that for a simple
