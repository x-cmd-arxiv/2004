intimately related to their host galaxies, most directly through their bars.
There is also convincing evidence for relations between the properties of
supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies and those of their host
galaxy. It is much less clear, however, how stellar (starburst) and non-stellar
(AGN) activity in the nuclear regions can be initiated and fuelled. I review
gas transport from the disk to the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of
galaxies, as well as the statistical relationships between the occurrence of
nuclear activity and mechanisms which can cause central gas concentration, in
particular bars and interactions. There are strong indications from theory and
modelling for bar-induced central gas concentration, accompanied by limited
observational evidence. Bars are related to activity, but this is only a weak
statistical effect in the case of Seyferts, whereas the relation is limited to
specific cases in starbursts. There is no observational evidence for a
statistical connection between interactions and activity in Seyferts, and some
evidence for this in starbursts, but probably limited to the extremes, e.g.,
ULIRGs. Some interesting hints at relations between rings, including nuclear
rings, and the presence of nuclear activity are emerging. It is likely that the
connection between the inflow of gaseous fuel from the disk of a galaxy on the
one hand and the activity in its nuclear region on the other is not as
straightforward as sometimes suggested, because the spatial- or time-scales
concerned may be significantly different.

dynamic spectrum, to the scattered pulsar image in a thin scattering screen
geometry. Recently discovered parabolic arcs in secondary spectra are generic
features for media that scatter radiation at angles much larger than the rms
scattering angle. Each point in the secondary spectrum maps particular values
of differential arrival-time delay and fringe rate (or differential Doppler
frequency) between pairs of components in the scattered image. Arcs correspond
to a parabolic relation between these quantities through their common
dependence on the angle of arrival of scattered components. Arcs appear even
without consideration of the dispersive nature of the plasma. Arcs are more
prominent in media with negligible inner scale and with shallow wavenumber
spectra, such as the Kolmogorov spectrum, and when the scattered image is
elongated along the velocity direction. The arc phenomenon can be used,
therefore, to constrain the inner scale and the anisotropy of scattering
irregularities for directions to nearby pulsars. Arcs are truncated by finite
source size and thus provide sub micro arc sec resolution for probing emission
regions in pulsars and compact active galactic nuclei. Multiple arcs sometimes
seen signify two or more discrete scattering screens along the propagation
path, and small arclets oriented oppositely to the main arc persisting for long
durations indicate the occurrence of long-term multiple images from the
scattering screen.

properties in common. In fact, from a purely phenomenological point of view,
these properties are even more widely observed: ion conduction behaves much
like electronic conduction in disordered materials (e.g., amorphous
semiconductors). These universalities are subject of much current interest, for
instance interpreted in the context of simple hopping models. In the present
paper we first discuss the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity in
hopping models and the importance of the percolation phenomenon. Next, the
experimental (quasi)universality of the ac conductivity is discussed. It is
shown the random barrier model is able to reproduce the experimental finding
that the response obeys time-temperature superposition, while at the same time
a broad range of activation energies is involved in the conduction process.
Again, percolation is the key to understanding what is going on. Finally, some
open problems in the field are listed.

massive theories. Using polarization vectors/tensors, several
interrelationships between various theories are uncovered and related issues
are elucidated. It is shown that the translational subgroup of Wigner's little
group for massless particles generate the momentum-space gauge transformations
in all the Abelian gauge theories considered here. While the defining
representation of the little group generates gauge transformations in massless
gauge theories, a different representation is shown to be necessary in the case
of gauge theories having massive excitations. The analysis of the gauge
generating nature of the translational group is also extended to theories
living in higher space-time dimensions. A method named (\it dimensional

underlying lattice is topologically hypercubic, in which case we explicitly
construct mimetic analogues of the volume form, the Hodge star operator, and
the Hodge inner product for arbitrary discrete geometries. It turns out that
the formalism singles out a pseudo-Riemannian metric on topologically
hypercubic graphs with respect to which all edges are lightlike. We study such
causal graph complexes in detail and consider some of their possible physical
applications, such as lattice Yang-Mills theory and lattice fermions.

  unramified principal series","25pg",,,,"math.QA math.RT",,"  We show how a certain limit of the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials appears
in the representation theory of semisimple groups over p--adic fields as matrix
coefficients for the unramified principal series representations. The result is
the nonsymmetric counterpart of a classical result relating the same limit of
the symmetric Macdonald polynomials to zonal spherical functions on groups of
p--adic type.

  for symplectic tableaux","42 pages",,,,"math.CO math.RT",,"  We give the first two-dimensional pictorial presentation of Berele's
correspondence \cite{Berele}, an analogue of the Robinson-Schensted (R-S)
correspondence \cite{Robinson, Schensted} for the symplectic group $Sp(2n, \Cpx
)$. From the standpoint of representation theory, the R-S correspondence
combinatorially describes the irreducible decomposition of the tensor powers of
the natural representation of $GL(n,\Cpx)$. Berele's insertion algorithm gives
the bijection that describes the irreducible decomposition of the tensor powers
of the natural representation of $Sp(2n, \Cpx)$. Two-dimensional pictorial
presentations of the R-S correspondence via local rules (first given by S.
Fomin \cite{Fomin,FominGen}) and its many variants have proven very useful in
understanding their properties and creating new generalizations. We hope our
new presentation will be similarly useful.

"math/0407048","Kobi Kremnitzer","Erik Backelin and Kobi Kremnizer","Localization for quantum groups at a root of unity","Mistakes corrected. Added content",,,,"math.RT math.QA",,"  In the paper \cite{BK} we defined categories of equivariant quantum
$\mathcal{O}_q$-modules and $\mathcal{D}_q$-modules on the quantum flag variety
of $G$. We proved that the Beilinson-Bernstein localization theorem holds at a
generic $q$. Here we prove that a derived version of this theorem holds at the
root of unity case. Namely, the global section functor gives a derived
equivalence between category of $U_q$-modules and $\mathcal{D}_q$-modules on
the quantum flag variety.
  For this we first prove that $\mathcal{D}_q$ is an Azumaya algebra over an
open subset ofthe cotangent bundle $T^\star X$ of the classical (char 0) flag
variety $X$. This way we get a derived equivalence between representations of
$U_q$ and certain $\mathcal{O}_{T^\star X}$-modules.
  In the paper \cite{BMR} similar results were obtained for a Lie algebra
$\g_p$ in char $p$. Hence, representations of $\g_p$ and of $U_q$ (when $q$ is
a p'th root of unity) are related via the cotangent bundles $T^\star X$ in char
0 and in char $p$, respectively.

molecule $H_2$ in its ground electronic state. If strong enough external field
is applied, it will dynamically distort such a system and supply it with time
(and field) dependent dipole moment. Although it is impossible to do so in the
undistorted system which has no coupling to the dipole component of the
external field, having induced in it a dipole moment, the rotational and
vibrational dynamics of such system can be manipulated using lasers. In this
work, a system is considered in which the external perturbation dynamically
induces the transition dipole moment between only two distinct levels. The aim
of the work is to show how the driving pulse can be analytically designed, that
will produce Rabi-like complete population oscillations between the two levels.
