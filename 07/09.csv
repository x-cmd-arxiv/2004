of the black hole and surrounding spheroid of stars are completely unknown,
leaving a large gap in our knowledge of how the Universe attained its present

X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed AGN which have luminosities and redshifts
characteristic of the sources responsible for most of the mass in present day
black holes. Strong submillimeter emission, an isotropic signature of copious
star formation, is found only in the X-ray absorbed sample, ruling out
orientation effects as the cause of the absorption. The space density and
luminosity range of the X-ray absorbed AGN indicate that they are undergoing
the transition between a hidden growth phase and an unabsorbed AGN phase, and
implies that the X-ray absorbed period in the AGN's evolution coincides with
the formation of the galaxy spheroid.

Galactic interstellar medium from its 1.809 MeV decay gamma-ray line emission,
has been a persistent problem for over twenty years. Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds were
thought to be the most promising source, but their calculated 26Al yields are
not consistent with recent analyses of the 1.809 MeV emission from the nearest
WR star and nearby OB associations. The expected 26Al yield from the WR star
exceeds by as much as a factor of 3, that set by the 2-sigma upper limit on the
1.809 MeV emission, while the WR yields in the OB associations are only about
1/3 of that required by the 1.809 MeV emission. We suggest that a solution to
these problems may lie in 26Al from a previously ignored source: explosive
nucleosynthesis in the core collapse SNIb/c supernovae of WR stars that have
lost most of their mass to close binary companions. Recent nucleosynthetic
calculations of SNIb/c suggest that their 26Al yields depend very strongly on
the final, pre-supernova mass of the WR star, and that those with final masses
around 6 to 8 solar masses are expected to produce as much as 0.01 solar masses
of 26Al per supernova. Such binary SNIb/c make up only a small fraction of the
current SNIb/c and only about 1% of all Galactic core collapse supernovae. They
appear to be such prolific sources that the bulk of the present 26Al in the
Galaxy may come from just a few hundred close binary SNIb/c and the intense
1.809 MeV emission from nearby OB associations may come from just one or two
such supernova.

determined using observed H-alpha and catalogued radio fluxes. H-alpha
extinction values are also derived from catalogued H-alpha and H-beta flux
values by means of an Rv dependent extinction law. Rv is then calculated in
terms of observed extinction values and catalogued H-alpha and H-beta flux

Bulge objects, observed values tend to be lower than catalogue values
calculated with Rv = 3.1. For the same subset we calculate <Rv> = 2.0,
confirming that toward the Bulge interstellar extinction is steeper than Rv =

suggested, and that the low-density warm ionized medium is the site of the
anomalous extinction. Lowvalues of extinction are also derived using dust

Eddington limit. We take into account the possibility of a non-viscous energy
release in the gravitationally unstable region of the disc. It leads to a
smaller accretion rate and to a redder continuum than a standard disc, which
agrees better with the observations. The observed bolometric luminosities
appear to saturate at a few times the Eddington luminosity for super-Eddington
accretion rates, as predicted by slim disc models. The accretion rate stays
always of the order of a few M$_{\odot}$/yr, indicating that the growing of the
BH is mass supply limited . Since the masses of the BH increases by one order
of magnitude in a few 10$^7$ years, it could explain why NLS1s appear to not
follow the same BH - bulge relation as other galaxies. NLS1s should thus play
an important role in shaping the mass function of local BHs. We discuss the
possibility that the masses could be systematically underestimated due to an
inclination effect, and we conclude that the accretion rates could thus be
strongly overestimated, but only in a small proportion of objects.

very high-energy photons are significantly absorbed by the cosmic infrared
background (CIB) radiation field, creating electron/positron pairs; since these
pairs are highly energetic, they can scatter the cosmic microwave background
radiation up to GeV energies, which may change the intrinsic afterglow light
curve in the GeV region. Using the theoretical modeling given in literature and
the reasonable choice of relevant parameters, we calculate the expected light
curve due to the regeneration mechanism. As the result, we find that the

the cosmology of a perfect fluid with a linear equation of state of a more

are free parameters. This non-homogeneous linear equation of state provides the
description of both hydrodynamically stable ($\alpha>0$) and unstable

the hydrodynamically stable dark (and phantom) energy. The possible types of
cosmological scenarios in this model are determined and classified in terms of
attractors and unstable points by the using of phase trajectories analysis. For
the dark energy case there are possible some distinctive types of cosmological
scenarios: (i) the universe with the de Sitter attractor at late times, (ii)
the bouncing universe, (iii) the universe with the Big Rip and with the

filled with an phantom energy, $w<-1$, may have either the de Sitter attractor

conclude that the emission line is not detected in their analysis. Although
their reduction procedure is accurate and robust, there are several differences
with ours. The most important one concerns the stacking of the spectral frames.
In the case of compact target sources [here: seeing-limited object,~3 pixels
FWHM in the spectral direction, on a 1"" (~7 pixels) wide slit] spectral shifts
occur between individual frames. Our reduction corrects for this effect using a
nearby strong emission line from a compact reference object, as described in
Pello et al. However, Weatherley et al. neglect this effect. This difference
turns out to be crucial. E.g. adopting their combination scheme as closely as
possible but correcting for the spectral drifts we recover the line detection.
We conclude that more work is needed to fully understand the origin of our
differences. However, their non-detection claim needs further investigation and

and slow (reaction coordinates) dynamics, so that the system can be described
by an effective, coarse grained Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. While such an
assumption may be valid in many circumstances, an explicit form of FP equation
is not always available. In our computations we bypass the analytic derivation
of such an effective FP equation. The effective free energy gradient and the
state-dependent magnitude of the random noise, which are necessary to formulate
the effective Fokker-Planck equation, are obtained from ensembles of short
bursts of microscopic simulations {\it with judiciously chosen initial
conditions}. The reaction coordinate in our micelle formation problem is taken
to be the size of a cluster of surfactant molecules. We test the validity of
the effective FP description in this system and reconstruct a coarse-grained
free energy surface in good agreement with full-scale GCMC simulations. We also
show that, for very small clusters, the cluster size seizes to be a good
reaction coordinate for a one-dimensional effective description. We discuss

then, we might broaden our perspective to look at works whose subjects fall
under the more general heading of ""Strong interactions between two dissimilar

these intervening years we find several highly important works in Physics and
Chemistry that come under this heading and were either connected with, or arose
from, JT systems, problems and approaches. Apart from high temperature
superconductors, we mention Yang-Mills gauge-forces, symmetry breaking (in
elementary particles), conical intersections in molecular potential surfaces,
surface crossings between them in chemical reactions, entanglements in the
quantum theory of measurements and Berry phases. We elaborate on the last two
topics. We show first that the slow evolution of a Txe coupling from the weak
to strong regime can model the quantum mechanical three-state measurement
situation, when the positions of the nuclei acts as the measuring device. We
then employ recently derived integral relations between component moduli and
phases in a time dependent wave-function to demonstrate the equivalence between
the state-reduction and the phase decoherence interpretations of the
measurement process.

(DFT). The linear-scaling capability of our method allows the consideration of
larger system sizes (up to 128 molecules in this study), even if the main
emphasis of this work is in the time scale. We obtain diffusivities that are
substantially lower than the experimental values, in agreement with recent
findings using similar methods. A fairly good agreement with D(T) experiments
is obtained if the simulation temperature is scaled down by ~20%. It is still
an open question whether the deviation is due to the limited accuracy of
present density functionals or to quantum fluctuations, but neither technical
approximations (basis set, localization for linear scaling) nor the system size
(down to 32 molecules) deteriorate the DFT description in an appreciable way.
We find that the need for long equilibration times is consequence of the slow
process of rearranging the H-bond network (at least 20 ps at AIMD's room
temperature). The diffusivity is observed to be very directly linked to network
imperfection. This link does not appear an artefact of the simulations, but a
genuine property of liquid water.

adsorbed layers when exposed to even mildly attractive surfaces. The
equilibrium properties of these dense interfacial layers have been extensively
studied theoretically. A large body of experimental evidence, however,
indicates that non-equilibrium effects are dominant whenever monomer-surface
sticking energies are somewhat larger than kT, a common case. Polymer
relaxation kinetics within the layer are then severely retarded, leading to
non-equilibrium layers whose structure and dynamics depend on adsorption
kinetics and layer ageing. Here we review experimental and theoretical work
exploring these non-equilibrium effects, with emphasis on recent developments.
The discussion addresses the structure and dynamics in non-equilibrium polymer
layers adsorbed from dilute polymer solutions and from polymer melts and more
concentrated solutions. Two distinct classes of behaviour arise, depending on
whether physisorption or chemisorption is involved. A given adsorbed chain
belonging to the layer has a certain fraction of its monomers bound to the
surface, f, and the remainder belonging to loops making bulk excursions. A
natural classification scheme for layers adsorbed from solution is the
distribution of single chain f values, P(f), which may hold the key to
quantifying the degree of irreversibility in adsorbed polymer layers. Here we
calculate P(f) for equilibrium layers; we find its form is very different to
the theoretical P(f) for non-equilibrium layers which are predicted to have
infinitely many statistical classes of chain. Experimental measurements of P(f)
are compared to these theoretical predictions.

$d$-dimensional space by the minimum enclosing polytope of a given arbitrary
shape. We present algorithms that work for a large family of shapes, provided
either only translations and no rotations are allowed, or only rotation about a
fixed point is allowed; that is, one is allowed to only scale and translate a
given shape, or scale and rotate the shape around a fixed point. Our algorithms
start with a polytope guessed to be of optimal size and iteratively moves it
based on a greedy principle: simply move the current polytope directly towards
any outside point till it touches the surface. For computing the minimum
enclosing ball, this gives a simple greedy algorithm with running time
$O(nd/\eps)$ producing a ball of radius $1+\eps$ times the optimal. This simple
principle generalizes to arbitrary convex shape when only translations are
allowed, requiring at most $O(1/\eps^2)$ iterations. Our algorithm implies that
{\em core-sets} of size $O(1/\eps^2)$ exist not only for minimum enclosing ball
but also for any convex shape with a fixed orientation. A {\em Core-Set} is a
small subset of $poly(1/\eps)$ points whose minimum enclosing polytope is
almost as large as that of the original points. Although we are unable to
combine our techniques for translations and rotations for general shapes, for
the min-cylinder problem, we give an algorithm similar to the one in
\cite{HV03}, but with an improved running time of $2^{O(\frac{1}{\eps^2}\log
\frac{1}{\eps})} nd$.

it should be in the universality class of a d-dimensional scalar model

numerically only considering Yang-Mills theory with gauge symmetry in the
G=SU(N) branch, where C(G)=Z(N). The symplectic groups Sp(N) provide another

Hence, in contrast to the SU(N) case, Sp(N) Yang-Mills theory allows to study
the relevance of the group size on the order of the deconfinement phase
transition keeping the available universality class fixed. Using lattice
simulations, we present numerical results for the deconfinement phase

e^{40}$. Using renormalisation group equations for the SM, we obtain the
effective potential in the 2-loop approximation and investigate the existence
of its postulated second minimum at the fundamental scale. The investigation of
the evolution of the top quark Yukawa coupling constant in the 2-loop
approximation shows that, with initial values of the top Yukawa coupling in the
interval $h(M_t)=0.95\pm 0.03$ (here $M_t$ is the top quark pole mass), a
second minimum of the SM effective potential can exist in the region
$\phi_{min2}\approx 10^{16}-10^{22}$ GeV. A prediction is made of the existence
of a new bound state of 6 top quarks and 6 anti-top quarks, formed due to Higgs
boson exchanges between pairs of quarks/anti-quarks. This bound state is
supposed to condense in a new phase of the SM vacuum. This gives rise to the
possibility of having a phase transition between vacua with and without such a
condensate. The existence of three vacuum states (new, electroweak and

experiments. The bi-large mixing can be explained by allowing five dominant
tri-linear couplings $ \lambda'_{1,2,3}$ and $\lambda_{1,2}$. The desired ratio
of the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass-squared differences can be obtained
in a very limited parameter space where the tree-level contribution is tuned to
be suppressed. In this allowed region, we quantify the correlation between the
three neutrino mixing angles and the tri-linear R-parity violating couplings.
Qualitatively, the relations $| \lambda'_1 | < | \lambda'_2| \sim |
\lambda'_3|$, and $|\lambda_1| \sim |\lambda_2|$ are required by the large
atmospheric neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ and the small angle
$\theta_{13}$, and the large solar neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{12}$,
respectively. Such a prediction on the couplings can be tested in the next
linear colliders by observing the branching ratios of the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP). For the stau or the neutralino LSP, the ratio
$|\lambda_1|^2: |\lambda_2|^2: |\lambda_1|^2 + |\lambda_2|^2$ can be measured

sector with three Higgs doublets, together with two real scalar gauge singlets

the seesaw scale. The atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is given by $\tan

bulk gauge symmetries and to reduce the rank of the gauge group. We consider
this mechanism in models with gauge trinification. We determine the boundary
conditions necessary to break the trinified gauge group directly down to that
of the standard model. Working in an effective theory for the gauge
symmetry-breaking parameters on a boundary, we examine the limit in which the
GUT-breaking sector is Higgsless and show how one may obtain the low-energy
particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We find that
gauge unification is preserved in this scenario, and that the differential
gauge coupling running is logarithmic above the scale of compactification. We
compare the phenomenology of our model to that of four-dimensional trinified
theories.

the ideal hadron-resonance gas including all known states up to a mass of about
1.8 GeV and full quantum statistics. The microcanonical average multiplicities
of the various hadron species are found to converge to the canonical ones for
moderately low values of the total energy, around 8 GeV, thus bearing out
previous analyses of hadronic multiplicities in the canonical ensemble. The
main numerical computing method is an importance sampling Monte-Carlo algorithm
using the product of Poisson distributions to generate multi-hadronic channels.
It is shown that the use of this multi-Poisson distribution allows an efficient
and fast computation of averages, which can be further improved in the limit of
very large clusters. We have also studied the fitness of a previously proposed
computing method, based on the Metropolis Monte-Carlo algorithm, for event
generation in the statistical hadronization model. We find that the use of the
multi-Poisson distribution as proposal matrix dramatically improves the
computation performance. However, due to the correlation of subsequent samples,
this method proves to be generally less robust and effective than the
importance sampling method.

non-local operator introduced by Gubarov, Stodolsky, and Zakharov is
classically equivalent to a principal gauged sigma model. The non-local mass
corresponds to the topological term of the sigma model. The latter is obtained
once the degrees of freedom implicitly generated in the non-local action are
explicitly implemented as group elements. The non-local action is recovered by
integrating out these group elements. In contrast to the usual gauge-fixed
treatment, the sigma model point of view provides a safe framework in which
calculation are tractable while keeping a full control of gauge-invariance. It
shows that the non-local massive Yang--Mills action is naturally associated
with the low-energy description of QCD in the Chiral Perturbation Theory
approach. Moreover, the sigma model admits solutions called center vortices
familiar in different (de)-confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scenarios.
This suggests that the non-local operator introduced by Gubarov, Stodolsky, and

contribution of counterterms to any given correlator needs to be computed. For

electromagnetic field of a microwave resonant cavity. Such a trap has several
novel features that make it very attractive for the development of ultracold
molecule sources. Using commonly available technologies, microwave traps can be
built with large depth (up to several Kelvin) and acceptance volume (up to
several cm^3), suitable for efficient loading with currently available sources
of cold polar molecules. Unlike most previous traps for molecules, this
technology can be used to confine the strong-field seeking absolute ground
state of the molecule, in a free-space maximum of the microwave electric field.
Such ground state molecules should be immune to inelastic collisional losses.
We calculate elastic collision cross-sections for the trapped molecules, due to
the electrical polarization of the molecules at the trap center, and find that
they are extraordinarily large. Thus, molecules in a microwave trap should be
very amenable to sympathetic and/or evaporative cooling. The combination of
these properties seems to open a clear path to producing large samples of polar
molecules at temperatures much lower than has been possible previously.

the duration of the interaction can impact signal generation. In mammalian
cells, clustering of receptors may be facilitated by heterogeneous zones of
lipids, known as lipid rafts. In vitro experiments show that disruption of
rafts significantly alters the dissociation of fibroblast growth factor-2
(FGF-2) from heparan sulfate proteoglycans, co-receptors for FGF-2. In this
paper, we develop a continuum stochastic formalism in order to (i) study how
rebinding affects the dissociation of ligands from a planar substrate, and (ii)
address the question of how receptor clustering influences ligand rebinding. We
find that clusters reduce the effective dissociation rate dramatically when the
clusters are dense and the overall surface density of receptors is low. The
effect is much less pronounced in the case of high receptor density and shows
non-monotonic behavior with time. These predictions are verified via lattice
Monte Carlo simulations. Comparison with experimental results suggests that the
theory does not capture the complete biological system. We speculate that
additional co-operative mechanisms might be present in order to increase ligand
retention, and present one possible ``internal diffusion'' model.

stimulation of a cardiac patch can be modeled by a 1D mapping, but not the full
behavior observed in the restitution portrait: in particular, not (i) distinct
slopes for dynamic and S1-S2 restitution (rate dependence) and not (ii) long
transients in the approach to steady state (accomodation). To address these
shortcomings, \emph{ad hoc} 2D mappings, where the second variable is a
``memory'' variable, have been proposed; it seems that these models exhibit
some, but not all, of the relevant behavior. In this paper we introduce a new
2D mapping and determine a set of parameters for it that gives a rather
accurate description of the full restitution portrait found for one animal. The
changes in the mapping, compared to previous models, result from requiring that
the mapping can be derived as an asymptotic limit of a simple ionic model.
Among other benefits, one can interpret the parameters in the mapping in terms
of the ionic model. The ionic model is an extension of a two-current model that
adds a third dependent variable, a generalized concentration. The simplicity of
the ionic model and the physiological basis for the mapping contribute to the
usefulness of these ideas for describing restitution data in a variety of
contexts. The fitting procedure is straightforward and can easily be applied to
obtain a mathematical model for data from other experiments, including
experiments on different species. Uniqueness of the parameter choice is also
discussed.
