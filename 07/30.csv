isotropic turbulence with Mach numbers $\sim 0.1... 1$. The equation of state
is dominated by the Fermi pressure of an electron-degenerate fluid. The
dissipation in these simulations is of purely numerical origin. For the
dimensionless mean rate of dissipation, we find values in agreement with known
results from mostly incompressible turbulence simulations. The calculation of a
Smagorinsky length corresponding to the rate of numerical dissipation supports
the notion of the PPM supplying an implicit subgrid scale model. In the
turbulence energy spectra of various flow realisations, we find the so-called
bottleneck phenomenon, i.e., a flattening of the spectrum function near the
wavenumber of maximal dissipation. The shape of the bottleneck peak in the
compensated spectrum functions is comparable to what is found in turbulence
simulations with hyperviscosity. Although the bottleneck effect reduces the
range of nearly inertial length scales considerably, we are able to estimate
the value of the Kolmogorov constant. For steady turbulence with a balance
between energy injection and dissipation, it appears that $C\approx 1.7$.
However, a smaller value is found in the case of transonic turbulence with a
large fraction of compressive components in the driving force. Moreover, we
discuss length scales related to the dissipation, in particular, an effective
numerical length scale $\Delta_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which can be regarded as the
characteristic smoothing length of the implicit filter associated with the PPM.

accurately locate the emission region of M81* in the galaxy's reference frame.
Although the emission region's size decreases with increasing frequency while
the brightness peak moves to the southwest, the emission region seems sharply
bounded to the southwest at all frequencies. We argue that the core must be
located between the brightness peak at our highest frequency (14.8 GHz) and the
sharp bound to the southwest. This narrowly constrains the location of the
core, or the purported black hole in the center of the galaxy, to be within a
region of +/-0.2 mas or +/-800 AU (at a distance of ~4 Mpc). This range
includes the core position that we determined earlier by finding the most
stationary point in the brightness distribution of M81* at only a single
frequency. This independent constraint therefore strongly confirms our earlier
core position. Our observations also confirm that M81* is a core-jet source,
with a one-sided jet that extends to the northeast from the core, on average
curved somewhat to the east, with a radio spectrum that is flat or inverted
near the core and steep at the distant end. The brightness peak is
unambiguously identified with the variable jet rather than the core, which
indicates limitations in determining the proper motion of nearby galaxies and
in refining the extragalactic reference frame.

defined as having orbital radii <= 0.5 AU. We show that terrestrial planets
similar to those in the Solar System can form around stars with hot jupiters,

orbital radii of hot jupiters (e.g. 0.15, 0.25 AU) potentially habitable

distributions exhibit distinct minima in the mid-type L dwarf regime followed
by a rise in number density for fainter/cooler brown dwarfs, predicting many
more T-type and cooler brown dwarfs in the field even for relatively shallow

substantial proportion of field dwarfs with T$_{eff}$ $\leq$ 500 K. The shape
of the substellar LF is fairly consistent for various assumptions of the
Galactic birth rate, choice of evolutionary model, and adopted age and mass

Unresolved multiple systems tend to enhance features in the observed LF and may
contribute significantly to the space density of very cool brown dwarfs.

equation governing inertial-modes can be separated into two ordinary
differential equations when the density is constant, or when the density has a
power-law dependence on radius. For more general density dependencies, we show
that one can obtain an approximate solution to the inertial-modes that is
accurate to the second order in wave-vector. Frequencies of inertial-modes are
limited to $\omega < 2 \Omega$ ($\Omega$ is the rotation rate), with modes
propagating closer to the rotation axis having higher frequencies. An
inertial-mode propagates throughout much of the sphere with a relatively
constant wavelength, and a wave amplitude that scales with density as
$1/\sqrt{\rho}$. It is reflected near the surface at a depth that depends on
latitude, with the depth being much shallower near the special latitudes
$\theta = \cos^{-1} \pm \omega/2\Omega$. Around this region, this mode has the
highest wave amplitude as well as the sharpest spatial gradient (the
``singularity belt''), thereby incurring the strongest turbulent dissipation.
Inertial-modes naturally cause small Eulerian density perturbations, so they
are only weakly coupled to the tidal potential. In a companion paper, we
attempt to apply these results to the problem of tidal dissipation in Jupiter.

  (nonlinearity, radiative envelope)","Astrophys.J. 635 (2005) 688-710","10.1086/497355",,"astro-ph",,"  The process of tidal dissipation inside Jupiter is not yet understood. Its
tidal quality factor ($Q$) is inferred to lie between $10^5$ and $10^6$. We
examine effects of inertial-modes on tidal dissipation in a neutrally bouyant,
core-less, uniformly rotating planet. The rate of dissipation caused by
resonantly excited inertial-modes depends on the following three parameters:
how well they are coupled to the tidal potential, how strongly they are
dissipated (by the turbulent viscosity), and how densely distributed they are
in frequency. We find that as a function of tidal frequency, the $Q$ value
exhibits large fluctuations, with its maximum value set by the group of
inertial-modes that have a typical offset from an exact resonance of order
their turbulent damping rates. In our model, inertial-modes shed their tidally
acquired energy very close to the surface within a narrow latitudinal zone (the
'singularity belt'), and the tidal luminosity escapes freely out of the planet.
Strength of coupling between the tidal potential and inertial-modes is
sensitive to the presence of density discontinuities inside Jupiter. In the
case of a discreet density jump (as may be caused by the transition between
metallic and molecular hydrogen), we find a time-averaged $Q \sim 10^7$. Even
though it remains unclear whether tidal dissipation due to resonant
inertial-modes is the correct answer to the problem, it is impressive that our
simple treatment here already leads to three to five orders of magnitude
stronger damping than that from the equilibrium tide. Moreover, our conclusions
are not affected by the presence of a small solid core, a different
prescription for the turbulent viscosity, or nonlinear mode coupling, but they
depend critically on the static stability in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter.

k-corrected color of the individual CMRs in the sample at a fixed absolute

entirely accountable by filter band shifting effects. We determine the mean of

0.026 mag. However, a modest amount of the dispersion arises from photometric
measurement errors and possible background cluster superpositions; and the
derived mean dispersion is an upper limit. Models which explain the CMR in
terms of metallicity and passive evolution can naturally reproduce the observed
behavior of the CMR in this paper. The observed properties of the CMR are
consistent with models in which the last episode of significant star formation

and is still ~90% at 10 keV. The EPIC pn camera is attached to an X-ray
telescope which has the highest collecting area currently available, in
particular at low energies (more than 1400 cm2 between 0.1 and 2.0 keV). Thus,
this instrument is very sensitive to the low-energy X-ray emission. However,
X-ray data at energies below ~0.2 keV are considerably affected by detector
effects, which become more and more important towards the lowest transmitted
energies. In addition to that, pixels which have received incorrect offsets
during the calculation of the offset map at the beginning of each observation,
show up as bright patches in low-energy images. Here we describe a method which
is not only capable of suppressing the contaminations found at low energies,

of the sources in the survey is performed on a medium-deep r' band optical

available. The photometry has been checked through simulations and by comparing
the data with those presented in a shallower and more extended ISOCAM survey in

luminous galaxies with H-Ks > 0.35 which are rarely, if ever, members of the

a very narrow range of IR color. Over the entire mass range covered by our

that the mass-to-light ratio in the Ks-band increases with mass. The agreement
between this result and earlier investigations of essentially non-overlapping

insensitive to the selection of the systems and to the details of the mass and

properties of relativistic, non-selfgravitating tori orbiting around black

the axisymmetric oscillations of vertically integrated tori in a Kerr
spacetime. The tori are modeled with a number of different non-Keplerian
distributions of specific angular momentum and we discuss how the oscillation
properties depend on these and on the rotation of the central black hole. We
first consider a local analysis to highlight the relations between acoustic and
epicyclic oscillations in a Kerr spacetime and subsequently perform a global
eigenmode analysis to compute the axisymmetric p modes. In analogy with what
found in a Schwarzschild background, these modes behave as sound waves that are
modified by rotation and are globally trapped in the torus. For constant
distributions of specific angular momentum, the eigenfrequencies appear in a
sequence 2:3:4:... which is essentially independent of the size of the disc and
of the black hole rotation. For non-constant distributions of angular momentum,
on the other hand, the sequence depends on the properties of the disc and on
the spin of the black hole, becoming harmonic for sufficiently large tori. We
also comment on how p modes could explain the high frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations observed in low-mass X-ray binaries with a black hole candidate
and the properties of an equivalent model in Newtonian physics.

intensity of the central component in CO(J=3-2) is almost twice as high as that

seen in shocked regions in our Galaxy, suggesting that these gas properties may
be related to AGN or starburst activity. The central component shows a linear
velocity gradient (~1.4 km/s/pc) perpendicular to the radio continuum jet,
similar to that seen in previous observations and interpreted as a
circumnuclear molecular disk/torus around the Seyfert 2 nucleus. In addition,

conjecture proposed by Chatterjee for the form of the stationary agent wealth
distribution. If the savings propensity for the equations is chosen according
to some random distribution we show further that the wealth distribution for
large values of wealth displays a Pareto like power law tail, ie P(w)\sim
w^{1+a}. However the value of $a$ for the model is exactly 1. Exact numerical
simulations for the model illustrate how, as the savings distribution function
narrows to zero, the wealth distribution changes from a Pareto form to to an
exponential function. Intermediate regions of wealth may be approximately
described by a power law with $a>1$. However the value never reaches values of

changed if three body agent exchange processes are allowed. We conclude that

phase transition was observed at a pressure of ~ 16.1 GPa. Unit cell parameters
were determined up to 12.4 GPa and the calculated cell volumes were found to be
well reproduced by a Murnaghan equation of state with K0 = 73.5 GPa and K' =
11.4. The structure of the high pressure phase above 16.0 GPa is quite

excitations has important strong coupling consequences for the topological
concept of an instanton vacuum. In the first part of this paper we elaborate on
the effective action for ``edge excitations'' in the Grassmannian $U(m+n)/U(m)
\times U(n)$ non-linear sigma model in the presence of the $\theta$ term. This
effective action contains complete information on the low energy dynamics of
the system and defines the renormalization of the theory in an unambiguous
manner. In the second part of this paper we revisit the instanton methodology
and embark on the non-perturbative aspects of the renormalization group
including the anomalous dimension of mass terms. The non-perturbative
corrections to both the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ functions are obtained while
avoiding the technical difficulties associated with the idea of {\em
constrained} instantons. In the final part of this paper we present the
detailed consequences of our computations for the quantum critical behavior at
$\theta = \pi$. In the range $0 \leq m,n \lesssim 1$ we find quantum critical
behavior with exponents that vary continuously with varying values of $m$ and
$n$. Our results display a smooth interpolation between the physically very
different theories with $m=n=0$ (disordered electron gas, quantum Hall effect)
and $m=n=1$ (O(3) non-linear sigma model, quantum spin chains) respectively, in
which cases the critical indices are known from other sources. We conclude that
instantons provide not only a {\em qualitative} assessment of the singularity
structure of the theory as a whole, but also remarkably accurate {\em
numerical} estimates of the quantum critical details (critical indices) at
$\theta = \pi$ for varying values of $m$ and $n$.

interaction $U$ in transition metals and compare the constraint local-density
approximation (LDA) with the GW approach. We clarify that they offer
complementary methods of treating the screening and should serve for different
purposes. In the GW method, the renormalization of bare on-site Coulomb
interactions between 3d electrons occurs mainly through the screening by the
same 3d electrons, treated in the random phase approximation (RPA). The basic
difference of the constraint-LDA method is that it deals with the neutral
processes, where the Coulomb interactions are additionally screened by the
``excited'' electron, since it continues to stay in the system. This is the
main channel of screening by the itinerant ($4sp$) electrons, which is
especially strong in the case of transition metals and missing in the GW
approach, although the details of this screening may be affected by additional
approximations, which typically supplement these two methods. The major
drawback of the conventional constraint-LDA method is that it does not allow to
treat the energy-dependence of $U$. We propose a promising approximation based
on the combination of these two methods. First, we take into account the
screening of Coulomb interactions in the 3d-electron-line bands located near
the Fermi level by the states from the subspace being orthogonal to these
bands, using the constraint-LDA methods. The obtained interactions are further
renormalized within the bands near the Fermi level in RPA. This allows the
energy-dependent screening by electrons near the Fermi level including the same
3d electrons.

first-order polyamorphous transition occurs in the orientational glasses based
on C60 doped with H2, D2 and Xe. A polyamorphous transition was also detected
in C60 doped with Kr and He. It is observed that the hysteresis of thermal
expansion caused by the polyamorphous transition (and, hence, the transition
temperature) is essentially dependent on the type of doping gas. Both positive
and negative contributions to the thermal expansion were observed in the low
temperature phase of the glasses. The relaxation time of the negative
contribution occurs to be much longer than that of the positive contribution.
The positive contribution is found to be due to phonon and libron modes, whilst
the negative contribution is attributed to tunneling states of the C60
molecules. The characteristic time of the phase transformation from the low-T
phase to the high-T phase has been found for the C60-H2 system at 12K. A
theoretical model is proposed to interpret these observed phenomena. The
theoretical model proposed, includes a consideration of the nature of
polyamorphism in glasses, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of the
transition. A model of non-interacting tunneling states is used to explain the
negative contribution to the thermal expansion. The experimental data obtained
is considered within the framework of the theoretical model. From the
theoretical model the order of magnitude of the polyamorphous transition
temperature has been estimated. It is found that the late stage of the
polyamorphous transformation is described well by the Kolmogorov law with an
exponent of n=1. At this stage of the transformation, the two-dimensional phase
boundary moves along the normal, and the nucleation is not important.

we come back to that analysis and we provide an interpretation of the numerical
results by showing that no contradiction is found with respect to Greene's
method. We show that the previous results based on the expansion in Lindstedt
series do correspond to the transition value but for a different map: the
semi-standard map (SSM). Moreover, we study the expansion obtained from the SM
and SSM by suppressing the small divisors. The first case turns out to be
related to Kepler's equation after a proper transformation of variables. In
both cases we give an analytical solution for the radius of convergence, that
represents the singularity in the complex plane closest to the origin. Also
here, the radius of convergence of the SM's analogue turns out to be lower than
the one of the SSM. However, despite the absence of small denominators these
two radii are lower than the ones of the true maps for golden mean winding
numbers. Finally, the analyticity domain and, in particular, the critical
constant for the two maps without small divisors are studied analytically and
numerically. The analyticity domain appears to be an perfect circle for the SSM
analogue, while it is stretched along the real axis for the SM analogue
yielding a critical constant that is larger than its radius of convergence.

found to depend on (i) the thickness of the film, (ii) the heating rate, (iii)
the maximum temperature to which film was heated and (iv) the cooling rate. The
observations are explained on basis of model which considers the film to be a
resultant of parallel resistances. The film's finite thermal conductivity gives
rise to a temperature gradient along the thickness of the film, due to this and
the temperature coefficient of resistance, the parallel combination of

zero-point motion of the magnons, as opposed to the usual semiclassical
derivation, where it is due to a divergence of the magnon occupation number.
Detailed analysis of the spectral functions along the (pi,0)-(pi,pi) line show
significant agreement with experiment, both qualitative and, in the principal
scales, quantitative. The observed slight approaching-then-receding of both the

conclude that optimally doped BSCCO has a well-developed pseudogap of the order

a small energy scale, unrelated to the AF scale, and primarily controlled by
the position of the chemical potential.

the two local sub algebras of observables uniquely determined by covariance and
invariance under the residual symmetry unitarily represented. These algebras
rely on the physical region of the manifold corresponding to a Killing horizon
cleaned up by removing the unphysical points at infinity (necessary to describe
the whole $PSL(2,\bR)$ action).Each of the found states can be interpreted as a
different thermodynamic phase, containing Bose-Einstein condensate,for the
considered quantum field. It is finally suggested that the found states could
describe different black holes.

N. Reshetikhin) on the Gaudin model and opers. We define a commutative
subalgebra in the tensor power of the universal enveloping algebra of a simple
Lie algebra g. This algebra includes the hamiltonians of the Gaudin model,
hence we call it the Gaudin algebra. It is constructed as a quotient of the
center of the completed enveloping algebra of the affine Kac-Moody algebra g^
at the critical level. We identify the spectrum of the Gaudin algebra with the
space of opers associated to the Langlands dual Lie algebra of g on the
projective line with regular singularities at the marked points. Next, we
recall the construction of the eigenvectors of the Gaudin algebra using the
Wakimoto modules over g^ of critical level. The Wakimoto modules are naturally
parameterized by Miura opers (or, equivalently, Cartan connections), and the
action of the center on them is given by the Miura transformation. This allows
us to relate solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations to Miura opers and
ultimately to the flag varieties associated to the Langlands dual Lie algebra
of g.

correlation function of the random force are analyzed near two dimensions. By
direct calculation it is shown that the approach based on the mere
renormalization of the nonlocal correlation function leads to contradictions at
two-loop order. On the other hand, a two-loop calculation in the
renormalization scheme with the addition to the force correlation function of a
local term to be renormalized instead of the nonlocal one yields consistent
results in accordance with the UV renormalization theory. The latter
renormalization prescription is used for the two-loop renormalization-group
analysis amended with partial resummation of the pole singularities near two

spin-orbit contact interaction as extracted from high-precision nucleon-nucleon
potentials is in perfect agreement with that of phenomenological Skyrme forces
employed in non-relativistic nuclear structure calculations. Additional
long-range contributions from chiral two-pion exchange turn out to be
relatively small. These explicitly density-dependent contributions reduce the
ratio of the isovector to the isoscalar spin-orbit strength significantly below
the Skyrme value 1/3. We perform a similar analysis for the strength function
of the $(\vec \nabla \rho)^2$-term and find values not far from those of
phenomenological Skyrme parameterizations.

protein fold but incompatible to any alternative folds. To select the correct
sequences and to guide the search process, a design scoring function is
critically important. Such a scoring function should be able to characterize
the global fitness landscape of many proteins simultaneously.
  Results. To find optimal design scoring functions, we introduce two geometric
views and propose a formulation using mixture of nonlinear Gaussian kernel
functions. We aim to solve a simplified protein sequence design problem. Our
goal is to distinguish each native sequence for a major portion of
representative protein structures from a large number of alternative decoy
sequences, each a fragment from proteins of different fold. Our scoring
function discriminate perfectly a set of 440 native proteins from 14 million
sequence decoys. We show that no linear scoring function can succeed in this
task. In a blind test of unrelated proteins, our scoring function misclassfies
only 13 native proteins out of 194. This compares favorably with about 3-4
times more misclassifications when optimal linear functions reported in
literature are used. We also discuss how to develop protein folding scoring
function.
