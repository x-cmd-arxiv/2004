quasar absorption spectra: the Croft et al. (2002) sample with a median
redshift z=2.72 and the LUQAS sample (Kim et al. 2004) with a median redshift
z=2.125. The best fit value for the {\it rms} fluctuation amplitude of matter
fluctuations is sigma_8 =0.94 +- 0.08 and n=0.99 +- 0.03, if we do not include
running of the spectral index. The best fit model with a running spectral index
has parameters n=0.959 +- 0.036 and n_run=-0.033 +- 0.025. The data is thus
consistent with a scale-free primordial power spectrum with no running of the
spectral index. We further include tensor modes and constrain the slow-roll
parameters of inflation.

products of the inflaton can also have perturbations results in an interesting
mixture of correlated adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. In particular,
negative correlation can improve the fit to the CMB data by lowering the
angular power in the Sachs-Wolfe plateau without changing the peak structure.
We do an 11-parameter fit to the WMAP data. We find that the best-fit is not

fusion reactions with ISM helium. Consequently, this nuclide provides a unique
diagnostic of the history of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The same hadronic
cosmic-ray interactions also produce high-energy gamma rays (mostly via neutral
pion production). Thus, hadronic gamma-rays and 6Li are intimately linked.
Specifically, 6Li directly encodes the local cosmic-ray fluence over cosmic
time, while extragalactic hadronic gamma rays encode an average cosmic-ray
fluence over lines of sight out to the horizon. We examine this link and show
how 6Li and gamma-rays can be used together to place important
model-independent limits on the cosmic-ray history of our Galaxy and the
universe. We first constrain gamma-ray production from ordinary Galactic cosmic
rays, using the local 6Li abundance. We find that the solar 6Li abundance
demands an accompanying extragalactic pionic gamma-ray intensity which exceeds
that of the entire observed EGRB by a factor of 2-6. Possible explanations for
this discrepancy are discussed. We then constrain Li production using recent
determinations of extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB). We note that
cosmic rays created during cosmic structure formation would lead to
pre-Galactic Li production, which would act as a ""contaminant"" to the
primordial 7Li content of metal-poor halo stars. We find the uncertainties in
the observed EGRB are so large that we cannot exclude a pre-Galactic Li which
is comparable to primordial 7Li. Our limits and their more model-dependent
extensions will improve significantly with additional observations of 6Li in
halo stars, and with improved measurements of the EGRB spectrum by GLAST.

new extrasolar planets discovered with periods shorter than two days, we argue
that the shortest-period cases observed in the period-mass relation may be
explained by a model whereby planets undergo strong tidal encounters with
stars, after either being scattered by dynamical interactions into highly
eccentric orbits, or tidally captured from nearly parabolic orbits. Although
this scenario does provide a natural explanation for the edge found for planets
at twice the Roche limit, it does not explain how such planets will survive the
inevitable expansion that results from energy injection during tidal
circularization.

  ""IAU Symposium 220, Dark Matter in Galaxies"", ed. Ryder, Pisano, Walker, and
  Freeman, San Francisco: ASP, in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Maximum disk mass models fitted to galaxy rotation curves are used to show
that dark matter (DM) halos in late-type and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies
satisfy well defined scaling laws. Halos in less luminous galaxies have smaller
core radii, higher central densities, and smaller central velocity dispersions.
Implications: (1) A single, continuous physical sequence of increasing mass
extends from the tiniest dSphs to the most luminous spirals. (2) The high DM
densities in dSph galaxies are normal for such dwarf galaxies. Since virialized
density depends on collapse redshift z, the smallest dwarfs formed about delta
z = 7 earlier than the biggest spirals. (3) The high DM densities of dSphs
implies that they are real galaxies formed from primordial density
fluctuations. They are not tidal fragments. (4) Because dwarf galaxies become
more numerous and more nearly dominated by DM as luminosity decreases, there
may be a large population of objects that are completely dark. Such objects are
a canonical prediction of cold DM theory. (5) The slopes of the DM parameter
correlations provide a measure on galactic mass scales of the slope n of the
power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations. Our results not yet
corrected for baryonic compression of DM give n = -1.9 +- 0.2. This is
consistent with cold DM theory.

(main results presented by Menendez-Delmestre in this volume) which serves as
an ideal anchor for the low-redshift Universe. In addition to measuring the
mean bar properties, we find that bar size is correlated with galaxy size and
brightness, but the bar ellipticity is not correlated with these galaxy
properties. The bar length is not correlated with the bar ellipticity. For
larger high redshift samples we analyze the bar fraction from the 2-square
degree COSMOS ACS survey. We find that the bar fraction at z~0.7 is ~50%,

has received increasing attention in cosmology, both as the outcome of the
originating process that generated our own universe, and as an explanation for
why our universe appears to be fine-tuned for life and consciousness. Here we
carefully consider how multiverses should be defined, stressing the distinction
between the collection of all possible universes, and ensembles of really
existing universes, which are essential for an anthropic argument. We show that
such realised multiverses are by no means unique, and in general require the
existence of a well-defined and physically motivated distribution function on
the space of all possible universes. Furthermore, a proper measure on these
spaces is also needed, so that probabilities can be calculated. We then discuss
several other major physical and philosophical problems which arise in the
context of ensembles of universes, including the emergence and causal
effectiveness of self-consciousness, realized infinities, and fine- tuning, or
the apparent need for very special initial conditions for our universe --
whether they or generalized generic primordial conditions are more fundamental.
Then we briefly summarise scenarios like chaotic inflation, which suggest how
ensembles of universe domains may be generated, and point out that the
regularities which must underlie any systematic description of truly disjoint
multiverses must imply some kind of common generating mechanism. Finally, we
discuss the issue of testability, which underlies the question of whether
multiverse proposals are really scientific propositions.

fitting. The main current application of our code is within the XSPEC
data-fitting package, however, its applicability goes beyond that: the code can
be compiled in a stand-alone mode, capable of examining time-variable spectral
features and doing polarimetry of sources in the strong-gravity regime. Basic
features of our approach are described in a separate paper (Dovciak, Karas &
Yaqoob 2004). Here we illustrate some of its applications in more detail. We
concentrate ourselves on various aspects of line emission and Compton
reflection, including the current implementation of the lamp-post model as an
example of a more complicated form of intrinsic emissivity.

a shell-type SNR dominated by synchrotron radiation in the X-rays. Its emission
(emission measure and photon index) as well as the absorption along the
line-of-sight has been characterized over the entire SNR. The X-ray mapping of
the absorbing column density has revealed strong well constrained variations
(0.4 10^22 cm^-2 < NH < 1.1 10^22 cm^-2) and, particularly, a strong absorption
in the southwest. Moreover, there are several clues indicating that the shock
front of RX J1713.7--3946 is impacting the clouds responsible for the
absorption as revealed for instance by the positive correlation between X-ray
absorption and X-ray brightness along the western rims. The CO and HI
observations show that the inferred cumulative absorbing column densities are
in excellent agreement with the X-ray findings in different places of the
remnant on condition that the SNR lies at a distance of 1.3 +/- 0.4 kpc,
probably in the Sagittarius galactic arm, instead of the commonly accepted
value of 6 kpc. An excess in the CO emission is found in the southwest
suggesting that the absorption is due to molecular clouds. A search for OH
masers in the southwestern region has been unsuccessful, possibly due to the
low density of the clouds. The X-ray mapping of the photon index has also
revealed strong variations (1.8 < Gamma < 2.6). [See the article for the entire

have used the astrometric and spectroscopic measurements to derive the

each component is likely in the range 0.034-0.070 Msol (GJ 569Bb) and
0.055-0.087 Msol (GJ 569Ba). This implies that the mass ratio, q, of the binary

known without any theoretical assumption. We have compared the dynamical masses

based on the thin disk approximation, considers the disk as concentric
cylinders in which we treat the vertical transfer as in a plane-parallel
medium. The formalism generalizes a work by Hubeny (1990), linking the disk
temperature distribution to the local energy dissipation and leads to
analytical formulae for the temperature distribution which help to understand
the behaviour of the radiation propagated inside the disks. One of the main
features of our new model is that it can take into account many heating
sources. We apply the method first to two sources: viscous dissipation and
stellar irradiation. We show that other heating sources like horizontal
transfer or irradiation from the ambiant medium can also be taken into account.
Using the analytical formulation in the case of a modified Shakura & Sunyaev
radial distribution that allow the accretion rate to be partly self-similar in
the inner region, and, for an alpha and beta prescription of the viscosity, we
obtain two-dimensional maps of the temperature, pressure and density in the
close environment of low mass young stars. We use these maps to derive the
observational properties of the disks such as spectral energy distributions,
high resolution spatial images or visibilities in order to underline their
different behaviours under different input models.

call these pseudobulges. As an existence proof, we review how bars rearrange
disk gas into outer rings, inner rings, and gas dumped into the center. In
simulations, this gas reaches high densities that plausibly feed star
formation. In the observations, many SB and oval galaxies show central
concentrations of gas and star formation. Star formation rates imply plausible
pseudobulge growth times of a few billion years. If secular processes built
dense central components that masquerade as bulges, can we distinguish them
from merger-built bulges? Observations show that pseudobulges retain a memory
of their disky origin. They have one or more characteristics of disks: (1)
flatter shapes than those of classical bulges, (2) large ratios of ordered to
random velocities indicative of disk dynamics, (3) small velocity dispersions,
(4) spiral structure or nuclear bars in the bulge part of the light profile,
(5) nearly exponential brightness profiles, and (6) starbursts. These
structures occur preferentially in barred and oval galaxies in which secular
evolution should be rapid. So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are
recognizable. Thus a large variety of observational and theoretical results
contribute to a new picture of galaxy evolution that complements hierarchical
clustering and merging.

The projected angular separation of this system corresponds to 240 AU at the

separation greater than 20 AU. This demonstration that brown dwarfs can form in
fragile, easily disrupted configurations is direct evidence that the formation
of brown dwarfs does not require ejection from multiple systems or other
dynamical effects. It remains possible that ejection plays a role in the
formation of some brown dwarfs, but it is not an essential component according

different electric property. In C-K XAS spectrum of B-diamond, the impurity
state ascribed to boron is clearly observed near the Fermi level. The Fermi
energy is found to be almost same with the top of the valence band of non-doped

models signals a particular fragility in the structure of metastable states of
such systems. This fragility is due to the presence of at least one marginal
mode in the Hessian of the free energy, that makes the states highly
susceptible under external perturbations. The cavity method is a technique that
recursively describes the property of a system with N+1 spins in terms of those
of a system with N spins. To do so, the cavity method assumes a certain degree
of stability when adding a new spin to the system, i.e. it assumes that for a
generic choice of the parameters there is an one-to-one correspondence between
the metastable states of the system with N spins and the metastable states of
the system with N+1 spins. In systems where the supersymmetry is broken such a
correspondence does not exist, and an alternative formulation of the cavity
method must be devised. We introduce a generalized cavity approach that takes
care of this problem and we apply it to the computation of the probability
distribution of the local magnetizations in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.

the gravitational field equations are identical to Einstein's equations of GR,
this formulation leads to a covariant tensor (instead of the pseudotensor) of
energy-momentum of the gravitational field and covariant conservation laws. We
further develop a geometric representation of FR as a metric-affine space, with
transition between FR represented as affine deformation of the connection.
Geodesic and autoparallel worldlines are considered. We show that the affine
connection of a NIFR has curvature and may have torsion. We calculate the
curvature for the uniformly accelerated FR. Finally, we show that GR is
inadequate to describe the gravitational field in a NIFR. We propose a
generalization of GR, which describes gravity as nonmetricity of the affine

the chiral Lagrangian including discretization effects up to next-to-leading
order (NLO) in a combined expansion in which m_\pi^2/(4\pi f_\pi)^2 ~ a \Lambda
(a being the lattice spacing, and \Lambda = \Lambda_{QCD}). We then focus on
the region where m_\pi^2/(4\pi f_\pi)^2 ~ (a \Lambda)^2, in which case
competition between leading and NLO terms can lead to phase transitions. As for
untwisted Wilson fermions, we find two possible phase diagrams, depending on
the sign of a coefficient in the chiral Lagrangian. For one sign, there is an
Aoki phase for pure Wilson fermions, with flavor and parity broken, but this is
washed out into a crossover if the twisted mass is non-vanishing. For the other
sign, there is a first order transition for pure Wilson fermions, and we find
that this transition extends into the twisted mass plane, ending with two
symmetrical second order points at which the mass of the neutral pion vanishes.
We provide graphs of the condensate and pion masses for both scenarios, and
note a simple mathematical relation between them. These results may be of
importance to numerical simulations.

the \nu_{\mu}\to \nu_{\tau} neutrino oscillations only. It is demonstrated
that, in the presence of the neutrino oscillations, consideration of the
neutrino flavor dependence in the background atmospheric neutrino flux leads to
the drastically different prospects between the observation of the

  Taking the galactic-plane neutrino flux as the targeted astrophysical source,
we have found that the galactic-plane tau neutrino flux dominates over the
atmospheric tau neutrino flux for E > 10 GeV. Hence, the galactic-plane can at
least in principle be seen through the tau neutrinos with energies just greater

$L$, the concentration and the chemical potential scale like $c=\xi/L$ and
$h=b/L$, respectively. We find that there exists a critical value $\xit$ such
that no phase separation occurs for $\xi\le\xit$ while, for $\xi>\xit$, the two
phases of the solvent coexist for an interval of values of $b$. Moreover, phase
separation begins abruptly in the sense that a macroscopic fraction of the
system suddenly freezes (or melts) forming a crystal (or droplet) of the
complementary phase when $b$ reaches a critical value. For certain values of
system parameters, under ``frozen'' boundary conditions, phase separation also
ends abruptly in the sense that the equilibrium droplet grows continuously with
increasing $b$ and then suddenly jumps in size to subsume the entire system.
Our findings indicate that the onset of freezing-point depression is in fact a
surface phenomenon.

  are Better",,,,,"math.PR math.ST stat.TH",,"  I show how any reversible Markov chain on a finite state space that is
irreducible, and hence suitable for estimating expectations with respect to its
invariant distribution, can be used to construct a non-reversible Markov chain
on a related state space that can also be used to estimate these expectations,
with asymptotic variance at least as small as that using the reversible chain
(typically smaller). The non-reversible chain achieves this improvement by
avoiding (to the extent possible) transitions that backtrack to the state from
which the chain just came. The proof that this modification cannot increase the
asymptotic variance of an MCMC estimator uses a new technique that can also be
used to prove Peskun's (1973) theorem that modifying a reversible chain to
reduce the probability of staying in the same state cannot increase asymptotic
variance. A non-reversible chain that avoids backtracking will often take
little or no more computation time per transition than the original reversible
chain, and can sometime produce a large reduction in asymptotic variance,
though for other chains the improvement is slight. In addition to being of some
practical interest, this construction demonstrates that non-reversible chains
have a fundamental advantage over reversible chains for MCMC estimation.
Research into better MCMC methods may therefore best be focused on
non-reversible chains.

mechanisms of dilepton production during relativistic heavy ion collisions are

that, due to the space-time finiteness of the pion system which generates the
corresponding quantum randomization, the dilepton rates are finite in the

effective masses are used. The calculations reveal significant deformation
effects in the low-momentum domain of $K^{\pi}=1/2^{\pm}$ states, mainly of
those lying near the Fermi surface. For other states, the deformation effect on
MD is rather small and may be neglected. The most remarkable result is that the
very different Skyrme parameterizations and the WS potential give about
identical MD. This means that the value of effective mass, being crucial for
the description of the spectra, is not important for the spatial shape of the

  Polarization-Entangled Photons","6 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, a quantum key exchange protocol has been described, which served as
basis for securing an actual bank transaction by means of quantum cryptography
[quant-ph/0404115]. Here we show, that the authentication scheme applied is
insecure in the sense that an attacker can provoke a situation where initiator
and responder of a key exchange end up with different keys. Moreover, it may
happen that an attacker can decrypt a part of the plaintext protected with the
derived encryption key.
