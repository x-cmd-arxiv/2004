we obtain the impurity entropy, charge valence and specific heat over the full

ways to enhance the directional emission from photonic crystal waveguides
through the beaming effect recently predicted by Moreno et al. [Phys. Rev. E
69, 121402(R) (2004)], by engineering the surface modes and corrugation of the
photonic crystal surface. We demonstrate that the substantial enhancement of
the light emission can be achieved by increasing the refractive index of the
surface layer. We also measure power of surface modes and reflected power and
confirm that the enhancement of the directional emission is related to the
manipulation of the photonic crystal surface modes.

velocity v=0; and because of this we call ""Frozen Waves"" such news solutions to

solutions can be used in many different and interesting applications, as
optical tweezers, atom guides, optical or acoustic bistouries, various
important medical purposes, etc.

fine dispersed metallic particles.
  In this work, we present a general model for ferrogels which are chemically
cross-linked polymer networks swollen with a ferrofluid. Our aim is to study
the effect of the shape and/or material (conductivity) anisotropy on the
effective electrical conductivity of the ferrogel in the presence of an
external magnetic field. Our theory can reproduce the known results, and
provides a link between the particle property and orientation distribution and
the effective electrical conductivity. To this end, we find that material
(conductivity) anisotropies are more important to yield a high effective
electrical conductivity than shape anisotropies, while magnetic fields can
offer a correction.

effects is called electro-magnetorheological (EMR) solids. Prediction of the
overall magnetic properties of the EMR solids is a challenging task due to the
coexistence of the uniaxially anisotropic behavior and structural transition as
well as long-range interaction between the suspended particles. To consider the
uniaxial anisotropy effect, we present an anisotropic Kirkwood-Fr\""{o}hlich
equation for calculating the effective permeabilities by adopting an explicit
characteristic spheroid rather than a characteristic sphere used in the
derivation of the usual Kirkwood-Fr\""{o}hlich equation. Further, by applying an
Ewald-Kornfeld formulation we are able to investigate the effective
permeability by including the structural transition and long-range interaction
explicitly. Our theory can reduce to the usual Kirkwood-Fr\""{o}hlich equation
and Onsager equation naturally. To this end, the numerical simulation shows the
validity of monitoring the structure of EMR solids by detecting their effective
permeabilities.

electro-magnetorheological (ERMR) fluids under the application of two crossed
dc magnetic (z axis) and electric (x axis) fields and a probing ac sinusoidal
magnetic field. We focus on the influence of the magnetic fields which can
yield nonlinear behaviors inside the system due to the particles with a
permanent magnetic dipole moment.
  Based on a perturbation approach, we extract the harmonics of the magnetic
field and orientational magnetization analytically. To this end, we find that
the harmonics are sensitive to the degree of anisotropy of the structure as
well as the field frequency. Thus, it is possible to real-time monitor the
structure transformation of ERMR fluids by detecting the nonlinear ac
responses.
