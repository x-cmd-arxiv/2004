have obtained a Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS)
observation centered on Cyg OB2 No. 8a, the most luminous X-ray source in the
Association. Although our analysis will focus on the X-ray properties of Cyg
OB2 No. 8a, we also present limited analyses of three other OB stars (Cyg OB2
Nos. 5, 9, and 12). Applying standard diagnostic techniques as used in previous
studies of early-type stars, we find that the X-ray properties of Cyg OB2 No.
8a are very similar to those of other OB stars that have been observed using
high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. From analyses of the He-like ion ""fir""
emission lines, we derive radial distances of the He-like line emission sources
and find these fir-inferred radii are consistent with their corresponding X-ray
continuum optical depth unity radii. Contrary to other O-star results, the
emission lines of Cyg OB2 No. 8a show a large range in line centroid shifts
(roughly -800 to +250 km/s). We discuss the implications of our results in
light of the fact that Cyg OB2 No. 8a is a member of a rather tight stellar
cluster, and shocks could arise at interfaces with the winds of these other
stars.

continuum and the line spectra. It was found that the nuclear emission is
dominated by an AGN. However, a young starburst, an older starburst with age of
4.5 Myr, and shock dominated clouds with velocities of 100, 300, and 500 km/s
also contribute. HII regions appear in the the extended regions (about 1 kpc),
where radiation and shock dominated clouds with Vs=100 km/s prevail. The
continuum SED of NGC 4579 is characterized by the strong flux from an old
stellar population. Emissions in the radio range show synchrotron radiation
from the base of the jet outflowing from the accretion disc within 0.1 pc from
the active centre. Radio emission within intermediate distances (10-20 pc) is
explained by the bremsstrahlung from gas downstream of low velocity shocks
(Vs=100 km/s) reached by a relatively low radiation flux from the AC. In
extended regions (>100 pc) the radio emission is synchrotron radiation created
by the Fermi mechanism at the shock front. The shocks are created by collision
of clouds with the jet. ~

than the exchange length is believed to be accomplished through the thermally
activated growth of a spatially localized nucleus, which initially occupies a
small fraction of the total volume. To date, the most detailed theoretical
treatments of reversal as a field-induced but noise-activated process have
focused on the case of a very long ferromagnetic nanowire, i.e., a highly
elongated cylindrical particle, and have yielded a reversal rate per unit
length, due to an underlying assumption that the nucleus may form anywhere
along the wire. But in a bounded-length (though long) cylindrical particle with
flat ends, it is energetically favored for nucleation to begin at either end.
We indicate how to compute analytically the energy of the critical nucleus
associated with either end, i.e., the activation barrier to magnetization
reversal, which governs the reversal rate in the low-temperature (Kramers)
limit. Our treatment employs elliptic functions, and is partly analytic rather
than numerical. We also comment on the Kramers prefactor, which for this
reversal pathway does not scale linearly as the particle length increases, and
tends to a constant in the low-temperature limit.

striking agreement with previous determinations of omega_b obtained from Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). However, a deeper comparison of BBN predictions
with the determinations of the primordial light nuclides abundances shows
slight tensions, motivating an effort to further improve the accuracy of
theoretical predictions, as well as to better evaluate systematics in both
observations and nuclear reactions measurements. We present some results of an
important step towards an increasing precision of BBN predictions, namely an
updated and critical review of the nuclear network, and a new protocol to
perform the nuclear data regression.

  Operators",,,,,"nucl-th",,"  We compute the matrix elements for pion emission from the nucleon induced by
twist-two light-cone operators in the kinematics where the pion is close to
threshold. It is shown that the results of heavy baryon ChPT are in agreement
with the results from the soft-pion theorem approach. Therefore the amplitude
of soft-pion emission is directly related to the generalized parton
distributions in the nucleon.

motion is presented using a possible alternative to the Lorentz transformation.
The main hypothesis assumed in this work are: a) The inertial transformations
relate two inertial frames: the privileged frame S and the moving frame S' with
velocity v with respect to S. b) The transformation of the fields from S to the
moving frame S' is given by H'=a(H - v D) and E'=a(E + v B) where a is a matrix
whose elements depend of the absolute velocity of the system. c) The
constitutive relations in the moving frame S' are given by D'= \epsilon E', B'=
\mu H' and J'=\eta E'. It is found that Maxwell's equations, which are
transformed to the moving frame, take a new form depending on the absolute
velocity of the system. Moreover, differing from classical electrodynamics, it
is proved that the electrodynamics proposed explains satisfactorily the Wilson
effect.

that the use of reasonable loss parameters in the model invalidates the
comment's main conclusion and highlights the benefits of increased transmission
rates.
