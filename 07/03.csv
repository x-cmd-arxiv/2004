elliptical galaxies and the relatively mild nuclear activity found in many such
systems. We show that there is such a relation in the sense that the active
ellipticals tend to be significantly less rotationally supported than their
inactive cousins. The correlation can partly be related to the galaxies'
luminosities: the brightest galaxies tend to be more active and less
rotationally supported. However, even at lower luminosities the active and
inactive galaxies seem to have systematically different dynamics. This
variation suggests that there are significant large-scale structural
differences between active and inactive elliptical galaxies, and hence that the
existence of both types of system cannot just be the result of random sporadic
nuclear activity.

unevenly sampled or incomplete maps with missing patches or intentionaly masked
parts. In addition, many astrophysical emissions are non stationary processes
over the sky. Hence spectral estimation using standard Fourier transforms is no
longer reliable. Spectral matching ICA (SMICA) is a source separation method
based on covariance matching in Fourier space which is successfully used for
the separation of diffuse astrophysical emissions in Cosmic Microwave
Background observations. We show here that wavelets, which are standard tools
in processing non stationary data, can profitably be used to extend SMICA.
Among possible applications, it is shown that gaps in data are dealt with more
conveniently and with better results using this extension, wSMICA, in place of
the original SMICA. The performances of these two methods are compared on
simulated CMB data sets, demonstrating the advantageous use of wavelets.

they constitute two groups with clearly distinct features. In this paper we
analyze in detail small amplitude variable red giants (about 15400 and 3000
objects in the LMC and SMC, respectively). The vast majority of these objects
are multi-periodic. At least 30% of them exhibit two modes closely spaced in
the power spectrum, what likely indicates non-radial oscillations. About 50%
exhibit additional so called Long Secondary Period.
  To distinguish between AGB and RGB red giants we compare PL diagrams of
multi-periodic red giants located above and below the tip of the Red Giant
Branch (TRGB). The giants above the TRGB form four parallel ridges in the PL
diagram. Among much more numerous sample of giants below the TRGB we find
objects located on the low luminosity extensions of these ridges, but most of
the stars are located on the ridges slightly shifted in logP. We interpret the
former as the second ascent AGB red giants and the latter as the first ascent
RGB objects. Thus, we empirically show that the pulsating red giants fainter
than the TRGB are a mixture of RGB and AGB giants.
  Finally, we compare the Petersen diagrams of the LMC, SMC and Galactic bulge
variable red giants and find that they are basically identical indicating that
the variable red giants in all these different stellar environments share
similar pulsation properties.

eigenspectra of galaxies are found to be convergent not only as a function of

spectra used in the analysis. From these data a set of ten eigenspectra of
galaxy spectra are constructed, with rest-wavelength coverage 3450-8350

onto a rapidly spinning neutron star has recently been discovered. This ``hot
brake'' flow forms in the two-temperature zone (close to a central object), but
at a sufficiently low accretion rate and a high spin it may extend in the
radial direction beyond ~300 Schwarzchild radii into a one-temperature zone.
When the spin of the star is small enough, the flow transforms smoothly to an
advection-dominated accretion flow. All gas parameters (density, angular
velocity, temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux) except for the radial
velocity are independent of the mass accretion rate. The radiative efficiency
may be arbitrarily large as M-dot -> 0. The gas angular momentum is transported
outward under most conditions, hence the central star is nearly always
spun-down. The flow is convectively stable. We also find that themal conduction
in the flow is strong enough to make the flow thermally stable. The very fact
that the density, temperature and angular velocity of the gas at any radius in
the hot brake flow are completely independent of the outer and inner (except
for the star spin) boundary conditions implies that the flow cannot be smoothly
matched to a general external medium as well as to general conditions on the
star surface. We demonstrate that there are two extra self-similar solutions:
one bridges the gap between the original solution and the external medium, and
another represents a boundary layer between the bulk of the flow and the star
surface, in which the gas temperature rapidly drops while the density builds
up. Finally, we briefly discuss that a hot brake flow may form around other
rapidly spinning compact objects: white dwarfs and black holes.

the expected number $N$ of observed GRBs above a peak photon flux $S$ for any
GRB jet structure. This new formalism directly provides the true GRB rate
without the need for a `correction factor'. We apply it to the uniform jet (UJ)
and universal structured jet (USJ) models for the structure of GRB jets and
perform fits to the observed log(N)-log(S) distribution from the GUSBAD catalog
which contains 2204 BATSE bursts. A core angle $\theta_c$ and an outer edge at
$\theta_{max}$ are introduced for the structured jet, and a finite range of
half-opening angles $\theta_{min}\leq\theta_j\leq\theta_{max}$ is assumed for
the uniform jets. The efficiency $\epsilon_\gamma$ for producing gamma-rays,
and the energy per solid angle $\epsilon$ in the jet are allowed to vary with
$\theta_j$ (the viewing angle $\theta_{obs}$) in the UJ (USJ) model,
$\epsilon_\gamma\propto\theta^{-b}$ and $\epsilon\propto\theta^{-a}$. We find
that a single power-law luminosity function provides a good fit to the data.
Such a luminosity function arises naturally in the USJ model, while in the UJ
model it implies a power-law probability distribution for $\theta_j$,
$P(\theta_j)\propto\theta_j^{-q}$. The value of $q$ cannot be directly
determined from the fit to the observed log(N)-log(S) distribution, and an
additional assumption on the value of $a$ or $b$ is required. Alternatively, an
independent estimate of the true GRB rate would enable one to determine $a$,
$b$ and $q$. The implied values of $\theta_c$ (or $\theta_{min}$) and
$\theta_{max}$ are close to the current observational limits. The true GRB rate
for the USJ model is found to be $R_{GRB}(z=0)=0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.05} Gpc^{-3}
yr^{-1}$.

SrTiO3 epitaxial thin films is calculated using density-functional theory
within the local-density approximation. Motivated by recent experiments, the
structure, zone-center phonons, and dielectric properties with and without an
external electric field are evaluated for several misfit strains within +-3% of
the calculated cubic lattice parameter. In these calculations, the in-plane
lattice parameters are fixed, and all remaining structural parameters are
permitted to relax. The presence of an external bias is treated approximately
by applying a force to each ion proportional to the electric field. After
obtaining zero-field ground state structures for various strains, the
zone-center phonon frequencies and Born effective charges are computed,
yielding the zero-field dielectric response. The dielectric response at finite
electric field bias is obtained by computing the field dependence of the
structure and polarization using an approximate technique. The results are
compared with recent experiments and a previous phenomenological theory. The
tunability is found to be strongly dependent on the in-plane lattice parameter,
showing markedly different behavior for tensile and compressive strains. Our
results are expected to be of use for isolating the role of strain in the
tunability of real ultrathin epitaxial films.

rich physical intuition of Teukolsky's approach to the results of fully
non-linear numerical simulations, one must approximate this Kinnersley tetrad
using raw numerical data, with no a priori knowledge of a background. This
paper addresses this issue by identifying the directions of the tetrad fields
in a quasi-Kinnersley frame. This frame provides a unique, analytic extension
of Kinnersley's definition for the Kerr geometry to a much broader class of
space-times including not only arbitrary perturbations, but also many examples
which differ non-perturbatively from Kerr. This paper establishes concrete
limits delineating this class and outlines a scheme to calculate the

coordinate-invariant information about gravitational radiation emitted in
strong-field dynamical scenarios. The main challenge in doing so is to identify
a null tetrad appropriately adapted to the simulated geometry such that
Newman-Penrose quantities computed relative to it have an invariant physical
meaning. In black hole perturbation theory, the Teukolsky formalism uses such
adapted tetrads, those which differ only perturbatively from the background
Kinnersley tetrad. At late times, numerical simulations of astrophysical
processes producing isolated black holes ought to admit descriptions in the
Teukolsky formalism. However, adapted tetrads in this context must be
identified using only the numerically computed metric, since no background Kerr
geometry is known a priori. To do this, this paper introduces the notion of a
quasi-Kinnersley frame. This frame, when space-time is perturbatively close to
Kerr, approximates the background Kinnersley frame. However, it remains
calculable much more generally, in space-times non-perturbatively different
from Kerr. We give an explicit solution for the tetrad transformation which is
required in order to find this frame in a general space-time.

pattern gives rise to a Higgs phase of gravity, in which gravity is modified in
the infrared. In this paper, we study the effects of direct couplings between
the Goldstone boson and standard model fermions, which necessarily accompany
Lorentz-violating terms in the theory. The leading interaction is the coupling
to the axial vector current, which reduces to spin in the non-relativistic
limit. A spin moving relative to the ""ether"" rest frame will emit Goldstone
Cerenkov radiation. The Goldstone also induces a long-range inverse-square law
force between spin sources with a striking angular dependence, reflecting the
underlying Goldstone shockwaves and providing a smoking gun for this theory. We
discuss the regime of validity of the effective theory describing these
phenomena, and the possibility of probing Lorentz violations through Goldstone
boson signals in a way that is complementary to direct tests in some regions of

cuasi-degenerate chiral nonet in the energy region around 1.4 GeV whose scalar
component has a slightly inverted spectrum. Based on the empirical linear
rising of the mass of a hadron with the number of constituent quarks which
yields a mass around $1.4 $GeV for tetraquarks, we conjecture that this
cuasi-chiral nonet arises from the mixing of a chiral nonet composed of
tetraquarks with conventional bar{q}q states. We explore this possibility in
the framework of a chiral model assuming a tetraquark chiral nonet around 1.4
GeV with chiral symmetry realized directly. We stress that U_{A}(1)
transformations can distinguish bar{q}q from tetraquark states, although it
cannot distinguish specific dynamics in the later case. We find that the
measured spectrum is consistent with this picture. In general, pseudoscalar
states arise as mainly bar{q}q states but scalar states turn out to be strong
admixtures of bar{q}q and tetraquark states. We work out also the model
predictions for the most relevant couplings and calculate explicitly the strong
decays of the a_{0}(1450) and K_{0}^*(1430) mesons. From the comparison of some
of the predicted couplings with the experimental ones we conclude that
observable for the isovector and isospinor sectors are consistently described
within the model. The proper description of couplings in the isoscalar sectors
would require the introduction of glueball fields which is an important missing
piece in the present model.

compared with the SMC small-$x$ data. Rough estimation of the slope $\lambda$,
controlling the small-$x$ behaviour of $g_1^{NS}\sim x^{-\lambda}$ from the SMC
data is performed. Double logarithmic terms $\sim (\alpha_s ln^2x)^n$ become
leading when $x\to 0$ and imply the singular behaviour of $g_1^{NS}\sim
x^{-0.4}$. This seems to be confirmed by recent experimental SMC and HERMES
data. Advantages of the unified $ln^2x$+LO DGLAP approach and the crucial role
of the running coupling $\alpha_s=\alpha_s(Q^2/z)$ at low-$x$ are also
discussed.

affine $\hat{sl}(3)$ Toda model coupled to matter (Dirac) fields (ATM). The
theory is treated as a constrained system in the contexts of the
Faddeev-Jackiw, the symplectic, as well as the master Lagrangian approaches. We
exhibit the master Lagrangian nature of the model from which generalizations of
the sine-Gordon (GSG) or the massive Thirring (GMT) models are derivable. The
GMT model describes $N_{f}=3$ [number of positive roots of $su(3)$] massive
Dirac fermion species with current-current interactions amongst all the U(1)
species currents; on the other hand, the GSG theory corresponds to $N_{b}=2$
[rank of the $su(3)$ Lie algebra] independent Toda fields (bosons) with a
potential given by the sum of three SG cosine terms. The dual description of
the model is further emphasized by providing some on shell relationships
between bilinears of the GMT spinors and the relevant expressions of the GSG
fields. In this way, in the {\bf first part} of the chapter, we exhibit the
strong/weak coupling phases and the (generalized) soliton/particle
correspondences of the model at the classical level. In the {\bf second part}

level of the equations of motion written in matrix form. The effective
off-critical $\hat{sl}(3)$ ATM action is written in terms of the
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) action plus some kinetic terms for the
spinors and scalar-spinor interaction terms. Moreover, this theory still
presents a remarkable equivalence between the Noether and topological currents,
describes the soliton sector of the original model and turns out to be the

insensitive to finite-size effects and may be applied even for a very small
system. The possibility of using various measurable quantities for sorting
events makes the procedure useful in studying clusterization phenomena, in
particular nuclear multifragmentation. Finite-size scaling and delta-scaling
relations are examined. The model shows inconsistency with some of the
delta-scaling expectations. The role of surface effects is evaluated by
comparing results for free and periodic boundary conditions.

treated within a Floquet scheme. The continuum problem of the photoelectron is
solved using a complex absorbing potential. Rate equations for the ionic

triggered by static stress changes and that earthquakes are located on a
fractal network of dimension D. This model predicts that both the number of
events triggered by an earthquake of magnitude m and the stress change induced
by this earthquake at the location of other earthquakes increase with m as
\~10^(Dm/2). The stronger the spatial clustering, the larger the influence of
small earthquakes on stress changes at the location of a future event as well
as earthquake triggering. If earthquake magnitudes follow the Gutenberg-Richter
law with b>D/2, small earthquakes collectively dominate stress transfer and
earthquake triggering, because their greater frequency overcomes their smaller
individual triggering potential. Using a Southern-California catalog, we
observe that the rate of seismicity triggered by an earthquake of magnitude m
increases with m as 10^(alpha m), where alpha=1.00+-0.05. We also find that the
magnitude distribution of triggered earthquakes is independent of the
triggering earthquake magnitude m. When alpha=b, small earthquakes are roughly
as important to earthquake triggering as larger ones. We evaluate the fractal
correlation dimension of hypocenters D=2 using two relocated catalogs for
Southern California, and removing the effect of short-term clustering. Thus
D=2alpha as predicted by assuming that earthquake triggering is due to static
stress. The value D=2 implies that small earthquakes are as important as larger
ones for stress transfers between earthquakes.

  Generalization to arbitrary lesion repair probabilities","18 pages, 3 figures. To be submitted to Physical Review E",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.GN",,"  This paper extends the semiconservative quasispecies equations to account for
arbitrary post-replication lesion repair efficiency. Such an extension could be
an important tool for understanding processes such as cancer development and
stem cell growth. Starting from the quasispecies dynamics over the space of
genomes, we derive an equivalent dynamics over the space of ordered sequence
pairs. From this set of equations, we are able to derive the infinite sequence
length form of the dynamics for a class of ``master-genome''-based fitness
landscapes. We use these equations to solve for a ``generalized''
single-fitness-peak landscape, where the master genome can sustain a maximum
number of lesions and remain viable. The central pattern that emerges from our
studies is that imperfect lesion repair often leads to increased mutational
robustness over semiconservative replication with completely efficient lesion
repair. The reason for this is that imperfect lesion repair breaks some of the
correlation between the parent and daughter strands, thereby preventing
replication errors from destroying the information in the original genome. The
result is a delayed error catastrophe over that expected from the original
semiconservative quasispecies model. In particular, we show that when only of
the strands is necessary for conferring viability, then, when lesion repair is
turned off, a semiconservatively replicating system becomes an effectively
conservatively replicating one.
