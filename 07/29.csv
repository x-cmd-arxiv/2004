a result, the maximum speed for C-shocks is lower than previously believed.

short period and small amplitude linked to collisional ionisation of H. Both

their error distributions, (iii) and estimating the true redshift distribution.
We compare two photometric redshift algorithms for these data and find that
they give comparable results. Calibrating against the SDSS and SDSS-2dF
spectroscopic surveys, we find that the photometric redshift accuracy is
$\sigma \sim 0.03$ for redshifts less than 0.55 and worsens at higher redshift
($\sim 0.06$). These errors are caused by photometric scatter, as well as
systematic errors in the templates, filter curves, and photometric zeropoints.
We also parametrize the photometric redshift error distribution with a sum of
Gaussians, and use this model to deconvolve the errors from the measured
photometric redshift distribution to estimate the true redshift distribution.
We pay special attention to the stability of this deconvolution, regularizing
the method with a prior on the smoothness of the true redshift distribution.
The methods we develop are applicable to general photometric redshift surveys.

an ensemble of classifiers, each classifier in the ensemble specializes in

tested using ten-fold cross-validation. Since the relevant information
concentrates in certain regions of the spectra we used the method of sequential
floating backward selection offline for feature selection.

we derive an upper limit to the velocity of the core relative to the rest of
the cluster of <230 km s^-1. Our previous Chandra image of A133 showed a
complex, bird-like morphology in the cluster core. Based on the XMM-Newton
spectra and hardness ratio maps, we argue that the wings of this structure are
a weak shock front. The shock was probably formed outside the core of the
cluster, and may be heating the cluster core. Our Chandra image also showed a
``tongue'' of relatively cool gas extending from the center of the cD to the
center of the radio relic. The XMM-Newton results are consistent with the idea
that the tongue is the gas which has been uplifted by a buoyant radio bubble
including the radio relic to the northwest of the core. Alternatively, the
tongue might result from a cluster merger. The small velocity of the core
suggests that the bubble including the relic has moved by buoyancy, rather than
by motions of the core or the ICM. We do not find clear evidence for nonthermal
X-ray emission from the radio relic. Based on the upper limit on the inverse
Compton emission, we derive a lower limit on the magnetic field in the relic of

hinges on a proper understanding of the nonlinear alpha effect. Boundary
conditions play a surprisingly important role in determining the magnitude of
alpha. For closed boundaries, the total magnetic helicity is conserved, and
since the alpha effect produces magnetic helicity of one sign in the large
scale field, it must simultaneously produce magnetic helicity of the opposite
sign. It is this secondary magnetic helicity that suppresses the dynamo in a
potentially catastrophic fashion. Open boundaries allow magnetic helicity to be
lost. Simulations are presented that allow an estimate of alpha in the presence
of open or closed boundaries, either with or without solar-like differential
rotation. In all cases the sign of the magnetic helicity agrees with that
observed at the solar surface (negative in the north, positive in the south),
where significant amounts of magnetic helicity can be ejected via coronal mass
ejections. It is shown that open boundaries tend to alleviate catastrophic
alpha quenching. The importance of looking at current helicity instead of
magnetic helicity is emphasized and the conceptual advantages are discussed.

map), is known to consist of two components; a Gaussian core and an exponential
tail. We use numerical gravitational-lensing experiments in a Lambda-CDM
cosmology for quantifying these two components. We especially focus on the
physical processes responsible for generating those two components. We develop
a simple empirical model for the exponential tail which allows us to explore
its origin. We find that the tail is generated by the coherent lensing scatter
by massive halos with M>10^14h^-1Msun at z<1 and that its exponential shape
arises due to the exponential cut-off of the halo mass function at that mass
range. On scales larger than 1 arc minute, the tail does not have a practical
influence on the lensing effects on the angular clustering. Our model predicts

catalog consisting of the largest sample of clusters in the redshift range for
which pointed X-ray observations were carried out with both the observatories.
We determined the emission-weighted X-ray temperatures of the clusters with
ASCA, while we studied surface brightness distribution with the ROSAT HRI
utilizing the isothermal beta model. We investigated the statistical properties
and trends for redshift evolution of the X-ray parameters including the
temperature, the density profile of the intracluster gas and the gas-mass
fraction within r500. We also present correlations of the cluster parameters
with the X-ray temperature and with the core radius and compare them with the
predictions of the self-similar model, from which we discuss the possible
origin of the double structure discovered in the core radius distribution.

on the ASTROD spacecraft is crucial. These perturbations need to be modelled

the 3 big asteroids and used this ephemeris framework to simulate the
determination of their masses together with other solar-system parameters and
relativistic-gravity parameters. In this paper, we extend the CGC 1 to CGC 2
ephemeris framework to include 492 asteroids (with diameter > 65 km) . We then
use CGC 2 to simulate the determination of ten parameters -- the masses of
Ceres, Pallas and Vesta, the six average densities for the other 489 asteroids,
classified into C, S,M,E,G and U types, and the rate of change of the
gravitational constant G. The fractional mass uncertainties for Ceres, Pallas

six types of asteroids are about 10**(-2)-10**(-3); that for G-dot/G is about

We stressed that photoionized media are not uniform in temperature and we
showed that photoexcitation and large column densities should be considered to

possible situations observed in photoionized plasmas, we consider here the
influence of microturbulence due for instance to a velocity gradient, of
different element abundance, and of different ionizing spectral distributions.
All new situations are computed using the same code, but with an improved
version of our He-like atomic model. We give values of the G and R ratios, the
equivalent width, and the ionic column densities with a greater accuracy than
previously achieved. A large microturbulence results in a decrease of the G
ratios for large column densities, for which the He-triplet resonant lines are
optically thick. On the contrary, the R ratio is almost independent of the
dispersion velocity and the element abundances, as long as the intercombination
lines are optically thin. Through two 'universal diagrams' not depending on any
parameter, we also present a way to determine the ionization parameter and the
total column density of the emitting regions from the temperature of the

flowing directly toward the central regions within about 10^8 years after the
initial collision. The rate of inflow declines when more than half of the total
gas supply reaches the inner few kpc, where the gas forms a dense nuclear ring

\~7 Msun/yr with a peak rate of 17 Msun/yr. The evolution of gas in a bulgeless
progenitor galaxy is also discussed, and a possible link to the ``chain
galaxy'' population observed at high redshifts is inferred. The evolution of
the structural parameters (the asymmetry and concentration) of both stars and
gas are studied in detail. Further, a new structural parameter (the compactness
parameter K) that traces the evolution of the size scale of the gas relative to
the stellar disk is introduced. Non-circular gas kinematics driven by the
perturbation of the non-axisymmetric structure can produce distinct emission
features in the ""forbidden velocity quadrants'' of the position-velocity
diagram (PVD). The dynamical mass calculated using the rotation curve derived
from fitting the emission envelope of the PVD can determine the true mass to
within 20% to 40%. The evolution of the molecular fraction $M_H2/M_(H2 + HI)

coupled accretion-jet model to interpret the observations. We model the
accretion flow as an outer standard thin accretion disk truncated at a
transition radius by an inner hot accretion flow. The accretion flow accounts
for the observed UV and X-ray emission, but it substantially under-predicts the
radio and infrared fluxes, even after we allow for nonthermal electrons in the
hot flow. We attribute the latter components to a jet. We model the jet
emission by means of the internal shock scenario which is widely employed for
gamma-ray bursts. In our accretion-jet model of XTE J1118+480, the jet
dominates the radio and infrared emission, the thin disk dominates the UV
emission, and the hot flow produces most of the X-ray emission. The optical
emission has contributions from all three components: jet, thin disk, and hot
flow. The model qualitatively accounts for timing features, such as the
intriguing positive and negative time lags between the optical and X-ray
emission, and the wavelength-dependent variability amplitude.

commensurability between the vortex lattice and the pinning array leads to the
well known local increments of the critical current. As temperature T
decreases, matching features progressively fade out and eventually disappear.
Further down in temperature vortex avalanches develop and dominate the magnetic
response. These avalanches manifest themselves as jumps in the dc-magnetization
and produce a lower ac-shielding giving rise to a paramagnetic reentrance in
the ac-screening x'(T). Within the flux jump regime two subregimes can be
identified. Close to the boundary where vortex avalanches develope, the field
separation between consecutive jumps follow the periodicity of the pinning
array and a field and temperature dependent screening is observed. In this
regime, the response also depends on frequency f in agreement with theoretical
models for magnetothermal instabilities. At low enough temperatures and fields,
the screening saturates to a constant value independent of T, H, and f, where
jumps are randomly distributed. We have also found that vortex instabilities
occupy a larger portion of the H-T diagram in patterned samples than in films

complex field dependence associated with different dynamic regimes. At very low
ac-drives where both, multiquanta vortices trapped by the antidots and
interstitial vortices oscillate inside the pinning potential (intra-valley
motion), a small kink in x'(H) together with a very low dissipation is
observed. At intermediate ac-excitations such that vortices in the antidots
remain pinned whereas interstices are driven out of the pinning well, a more
pronounced kink in the screening coinciding with the onset of dissipation
(x''(H) ~ 0) indicates the entrance of interstitial vortices. Eventually, at
high enough amplitudes all vortices are set in motion and the penetration of
interstitial vortices appears as a sudden reduction of the shielding power. We
show that these distinctive features allow us to clearly identify the maximum

of the LJ fluid is found to be very similar to the behavior of water near
hydrophobic surfaces (Brovchenko et al. J.Phys.: Cond.Matt. v.16, 2004). A
universal critical behavior of the local order parameter, defined as the
difference between the local densities of the coexisting liquid and vapor
phases at some distance z from the pore walls, Deltarho(z) = (rho_l(z) -
rho_v(z))/2, is observed in a wide temperature range and found to be consistent
with the surface critical behavior of the Ising model. Near the surface the
dependence of the order parameter on the reduced temperature tau = (T_c -
T)/T_c obeys a scaling law ~ tau^(beta_1) with a critical exponent beta_1 of
about 0.8, corresponding to the ordinary surface transition. A crossover from
bulk-like to surface-like critical behavior with increasing temperature occurs,
when the correlation length is about half the distance to the surface.

free flow of grains from a silo discharging by gravity. When the outlet size is
not much bigger than the beads, granular material jams the outlet of the

grains fallen between consecutive jams are presented. The information that they
provide can help to understand the jamming phenomenon. As the ratio between the
size of the orifice and the size of the beads is increased, the probability
that an arch blocks the outlet decreases. We show here that there is a power
law divergence of the mean avalanche size for a finite critical radius. Beyond
this critical radius no jamming can occur and the flow is never stopped. The
dependence of the arch formation on the shape and the material of the grains
has been explored. It has been found that the material properties of the grains
do not affect the arch formation probability. On the contrary, the shape of the
grains deeply influences it. A simple model to interpret the results is also

blocks the motion of the integer spin nearby the surface. The electron

stars, while a mild non-linearity is still tractable perturbatively but
requires to consider mode coupling. It is natural to start to look at this
problem by considering the coupling between linear radial and non-radial modes.
Radial pulsations of a spherical compact objects do not per se emit
gravitational waves but, if the coupling is efficient in driving and possibly
amplifying the non-radial modes, gravitational radiation could then be produced
to a significant level.
  In this paper we develop the relativistic formalism to study the coupling of
radial and non-radial first order perturbations of a compact spherical star.
  From a mathematical point of view, it is convenient to treat the two sets of
perturbations as separately parametrized, using a 2-parameter perturbative
expansion of the metric, the energy-momentum tensor and Einstein equations in
which $\lambda$ is associated with the radial modes, $\epsilon$ with the
non-radial perturbations, and the $\lambda\epsilon$ terms describe the
coupling. This approach provides a well-defined framework to consider the gauge
dependence of perturbations, allowing us to use $\epsilon$ order
gauge-invariant non-radial variables on the static background and to define new
second order $\lambda\epsilon$ gauge-invariant variables describing the
non-linear coupling. We present the evolution and constraint equations for our
variables outlining the setup for numerical computations, and briefly discuss
the surface boundary conditions in terms of the second order $\lambda\epsilon$

coordinates are treated as independent functions, and encode the coordinate
freedom of solutions. Techniques are discussed to impose particular gauge
conditions through a specification of the source functions. A 3D, free

scalar field matter source is described. The second-order-in-space-and-time
partial differential equations are discretized directly without the use first
order auxiliary terms, limiting the number of independent functions to
fifteen--ten metric quantities, four source functions and the scalar field.
This also limits the number of constraint equations, which can only be enforced
to within truncation error in a numerical free evolution, to four. The
coordinate system is compactified to spatial infinity in order to impose
physically motivated, constraint-preserving outer boundary conditions. A
variant of the Cartoon method for efficiently simulating axisymmetric

with the naturalness argument of 't Hooft. This argument is based on an
observation that the right-handed components of neutrinos in the massless limit
exhibit an extra enhanced symmetry which is absent in other charged fermions.
This enhanced symmetry is reminiscent of the Nambu-Goldstone fermions
associated with spontaneously broken supersymmetry. The conventional seesaw

$q$ rounds there is at least one element with $k$ or fewer lies. The game is
dual to the original Renyi-Ulam liar game for which the winning condition is
that at most one element has $k$ or fewer lies. We prove the existence of a
winning strategy for Paul to the existence of a covering of the discrete

require extensive mining and refining to extract useful information. We
demonstrate the usefulness of (nonmetric) multidimensional scaling (MDS) method
in analyzing a large number of genes. Applying MDS to the microarray data is
certainly not new, but the existing works are all on small numbers
  (< 100) of points to be analyzed. We have been developing an efficient novel
algorithm for nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis for very large
data sets as a maximally unsupervised data mining device. We wish to
demonstrate its usefulness in the context of bioinformatics (unraveling
relational patterns among genes from time series data in this paper).
  Results: The Pearson correlation coefficient with its sign flipped is used to
measure the dissimilarity of the gene activities in transcriptional response of
cell-cycle-synchronized human fibroblasts to serum [Iyer {\it et al}., Science
{\bf 283}, 83 (1999)]. These dissimilarity data have been analyzed with our
nMDS algorithm to produce an almost circular relational pattern of the genes.
The obtained pattern expresses a temporal order in the data in this example;
the temporal expression pattern of the genes rotates along this circular
arrangement and is related to the cell cycle. For the data we analyze in this
paper we observe the following. If an appropriate preparation procedure is
applied to the original data set, linear methods such as the principal
component analysis (PCA) could achieve reasonable results, but without data
preprocessing linear methods such as PCA cannot achieve a useful picture.
Furthermore, even with an appropriate data preprocessing, the outcomes of
linear procedures are not as clearcut as those by nMDS without preprocessing.

preceding diastolic interval (DI), is a useful tool for predicting the onset of
abnormal cardiac rhythms. However, it is known that different pacing protocols
lead to different APD restitution curves (RCs). This phenomenon, known as APD
rate-dependence, is a consequence of memory in the tissue. In addition to APD
restitution, conduction velocity restitution also plays an important role in
the spatiotemporal dynamics of cardiac tissue. We present new results
concerning rate-dependent restitution in the velocity of propagating action
potentials in a one-dimensional fiber. Our numerical simulations show that,
independent of the amount of memory in the tissue, waveback velocity exhibits
pronounced rate-dependence and the wavefront velocity does not. Moreover, the
discrepancy between waveback velocity RCs is most significant for small DI. We
provide an analytical explanation of these results, using a system of coupled
maps to relate the wavefront and waveback velocities. Our calculations show
that waveback velocity rate-dependence is due to APD restitution, not memory.

chains as well as in a two-leg spin ladder is analyzed by using the spin-spin
concurrence and the entanglement entropy between a selected sublattice of spins
and the rest of the system. In particular, we reveal that quantum phase
transition points/boundaries may be identified based on the analysis on the
local extreme of this entanglement entropy, which is illustrated to be superior
over the concurrence scenario and may enable us to explore quantum phase
transitions in many other systems including higher dimensional ones.

states are rays in the standard Hilbert space of the theory, one is naturally
lead to a geometric formulation of the theory. Within this formulation of
quantum mechanics, the resulting description is very elegant from the
geometrical viewpoint, since it allows to cast the main postulates of the
theory in terms of two geometric structures, namely a symplectic structure and
a Riemannian metric. However, the usual superposition principle of quantum
mechanics is not naturally incorporated, since the quantum state space is
non-linear. In this note we offer some steps to incorporate the superposition
principle within the geometric description. In this respect, we argue that it
is necessary to make the distinction between a 'projective superposition
principle' and a 'decomposition principle' that extend the standard
superposition principle. We illustrate our proposal with two very well known
examples, namely the spin 1/2 system and the two slit experiment, where the
distinction is clear from the physical perspective. We show that the two
principles have also a different mathematical origin within the geometrical
formulation of the theory.
