Lya forest, where the extragalactic background radiation field ionizes and
heats the gas, we find that grain photoelectric heating by the FUV background
is not sufficient to balance the C II 158um cooling rate inferred from DLAs. In
these systems, a local energy source is required. We show that in the case of
the z=1.919 DLA toward Q2206-19, the local source is FUV emission from the
associated galaxy found by Moller et al (2002): the mean intensity inferred
from photometry is in good agreement with the intensity Jnu required to explain
the cooling rate. The FUV mean intensity predicted for a cold neutral medium
(CNM) model, Jnu=(1.7+2.7-1.0)x10^(-18) cgs (95% c.l.), is the largest expected
from our CII* study of 45 DLAs. This may explain why this is the only confirmed
DLA yet detected in emission at z>1.9. We argue that in most DLAs with detected
CII* absorption, Jnu is between 10^{-19} and 10^{-18} and heats the gas which
is a CNM. By contrast, in most DLAs with upper limits on CII* absorption the
gas is a warm neutral medium (WNM). Surprisingly, the upper limits are
compatible with the same range of Jnu values suggesting the majority of DLAs
are heated by radiation fields generated by a limited range of star formation
rates per unit H I area, between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2} Msol/kpc^2. We also show
that CII* absorption is unlikely to arise in gas that is ionized.

from non-radiative shocks in the NE and NW regions. At X-ray energies the
northeast shock exhibits predominantly nonthermal synchrotron emission, while
the northwest shock exhibits a thermal spectrum. We present far ultraviolet
spectra of the northeast (NE) and northwest (NW) portions of SN 1006 acquired
with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). We have detected
emission lines of O VI (1032, 1038 A) and broad Ly-beta (1025 A) in the NW
filament, but detect no emission lines in the NE region. We observed in the NW
an O VI intensity of measured an O VI line width of 2100 km s-1 at a position
where the H-alpha width was measured to be 2290 km s-1(Ghavamian et al. 2002).
This implies less than mass proportional heating of the ions. Using the ratio
of intensities, I(NW)/I(NE) ~ n(NW)/n(NE), the density ratio of the two regions
is found to be >4, a value that is with the uncertainties of the ratio of 2.5
measured by Long et al. (2003). The derived O VI kinetic temperature is
compared to previous estimates of electron, proton, and ion temperatures in the
remnant to study the relative heating efficiency of various species at the
shock front. The degree of postshock temperature equilibration may be crucial
to particle acceleration since the temperature of each species determines the
number of high speed particles available for injection into an acceleration
process that could produce Galactic cosmic rays.

very attractive features, including automatic stability and darkness, the
ability to mimic the broad features of cold dark matter while in the linear
density perturbation regime, and consistency with all direct dark matter search
experiments, both negative (e.g. CDMS II) and positive (DAMA). In this paper we
consider an important unsolved problem: Are there plausible reasons to explain
why most of the mirror matter in spiral galaxies exists in the form of gaseous
{\it spheroidal} galactic halos around ordinary matter {\it disks}? We compute
an order-of-magnitude estimate that the mirror photon luminosity of a typical
spiral galaxy today is around $10^{44}$ erg/s. Interestingly, this rate of
energy loss is similar to the power supplied by ordinary supernova explosions.
We discuss circumstances under which supernova power can be used to heat the
gaseous part of the mirror matter halo and hence prevent its collapse to a
disk. The {\it macro}scopic ordinary-mirror asymmetry plays a fundamental role
in our analysis.

nearly 3 binary orbital cycles. The X-ray and UV data show evidence for a
prominent dip before the eclipse which is due to the accretion stream obscuring
the accretion region. The dip ingress is rapid in hard X-rays suggesting there
is a highly collimated core of absorption. We find that a different level of
absorption column density is required to match the observed count rates in
different energy bands. We propose that this is due to the fact that different
absorption components should be used to model the reprocessed X-rays, the
shocked X-ray component and the UV emission and explore the affect that this
has on the resulting fits to the spectrum. Further, there is evidence that
absorption starts to obscure the softer X-rays shortly after the onset of the
bright phase. This suggests that material is threaded by an unusually wide
range of magnetic field lines, consistent with the suggestion of Bridge et al.
We find that the period is slightly greater than that determined by Schwope &

beryllium abundance is very similar to that of field stars of similar Fe
content. We interpret the beryllium abundance observed as the result of primary
spallation of cosmic rays acting on a Galactic scale, showing that beryllium
can be used as a powerful cosmochronometer for the first stellar generations.
With this method, we estimate that the cluster formed 0.2-0.3 Gyr after the
onset of star formation in the Galaxy, in excellent agreement with the age
derived from main sequence fitting. From the same spectra we also find low O
(noticeably different for the two stars) and high N abundances, suggesting that
the original gas was enriched in CNO processed material. Our beryllium results,
together with the N, O, and Li abundances, provide insights on the formation of
this globular cluster, showing that any CNO processing of the gas must have
occurred in the protocluster cloud before the formation of the stars we observe
now. We encounter, however, difficulties in giving a fully consistent picture
of the cluster formation, able to explain the complex overall abundance
pattern.

examine zero-frequency shot noise for two special cases: (i) a single-molecule

method facilitates calculation of single-electron transmission and reflection
amplitudes for inelastic processes under nonequilibrium conditions in the

shot noise display additional peaks as bias-voltage increases due to
phonon-assisted processes. In the case of coupled QDs, our nonperturbative
calculations account for the electron-phonon interaction on an equal footing
with couplings to the leads, as well as the coupling between the two dots. Our
results exhibit oscillations in both the current and shot noise as functions of

in the topology of a symmetric tetrahedron, uniformly frustrated with one-half
flux-quantum per loop and one-half Cooper-pair per island. This structure
emulates a noise-resistant spin-1/2 system in a vanishing magnetic field.
  The tetrahedral quantum bit combines a number of advances such as a doubly
degeneracy ground state minimizing decoherence via phonon radiation, a weak
quadratic sensitivity to electric and magnetic noise, relieved constraints on
the junction fabrication, a large freedom in manipulation, and attractive
measurement schemes.
  The simultaneous appearance of a degenerate ground state and a weak noise
sensitivity are consequences of the tetrahedral symmetry, while enhanced
quantum fluctuations derive from the special magnetic frustration. We determine
the spectral properties of the tetrahedral structure within a semiclassical
analysis and confirm the results numerically. We show how proper tuning of the
charge-frustration selects a doubly degenerate ground state and discuss the
qubit's manipulation through capacitive and inductive coupling to external bias
sources.
  The complete readout of all the spin-components is achieved through coupling
of the internal qubit currents to external junctions driven close to
criticality during the measurement.

the method of Lyapunov exponents) for a large variety of initial conditions.
For quasi-circular orbits, we find no chaotic behavior for black holes with

a Newtonian gravitational-wave frequency less than 150 Hz. Only for rather
small initial radial distances, for which spin-spin induced oscillations in the
radial separation are rather important, do we find chaotic solutions, and even
then they are rare. Moreover, these chaotic quasi-circular orbits are of
questionable astrophysical significance, since they originate from direct
parametrization of the equations of motion rather than from widely separated
binaries evolving to small separations under gravitational radiation reaction.
In the case of highly eccentric orbits, which for ground-based interferometers
are not astrophysically favored, we again find chaotic solutions, but only at
pericenters so small that higher order PN corrections, especially higher spin
PN corrections, should also be taken into account.

  Science, Ed. V. Dvoeglazov, 113-133, 2010",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The new `quantum-foam in-flow' theory of gravity has explained numerous
so-called gravitational anomalies, particularly the `dark matter' effect which
is now seen to be a dynamical effect of space itself, and whose strength is
determined by the fine structure constant, and not by Newton's gravitational
constant G. Here we show an experimentally significant approximate dynamical
effect, namely a vector superposition effect which arises under certain
dynamical conditions when we have absolute motion and gravitational in-flows:
the velocities for these processes are shown to be approximately vectorially
additive under these conditions. This effect plays a key role in interpreting
the data from the numerous experiments that detected the absolute linear motion
of the earth. The violations of this superposition effect lead to observable
effects, such as the generation of turbulence. The flow theory also leads to
vorticity effects that the Gravity Probe B gyroscope experiment will soon begin
observing. As previously reported General Relativity predicts a smaller
vorticity effect (therein called the Lense-Thirring `frame-dragging' effect)
than the new theory of gravity.

protein microarrays give as a result groups of interesting, e.g. differentially
regulated genes which require further biological interpretation. With the
systematic functional annotation provided by the Gene Ontology the information
required to automate the interpretation task is now accessible. However, the
determination of statistical significant e.g. molecular functions within these
groups is still an open question. In answering this question, multiple testing
issues must be taken into account to avoid misleading results. Here we present
a statistical framework that tests whether functions, processes or locations
described in the Gene Ontology are significantly enriched within a group of
interesting genes when compared to a reference group. First we define an exact
analytical expression for the expected number of false positives that allows us
to calculate adjusted p-values to control the false discovery rate. Next, we
demonstrate and discuss the capabilities of our approach using publicly
available microarray data on cell-cycle regulated genes. Further, we analyze
the robustness of our framework with respect to the exact gene group
composition and compare the performance with earlier approaches. The software
package GOSSIP implements our method and is made freely available at

is considered as an essential feature of quantum systems. They also define a
new measure of information which is inherently different from the Shannon
information and try to show that the latter is not useful in defining the
information content in a quantum object.
  Here, we show that there are serious problems in their approach which make
their efforts unsatisfactory. The finiteness of information does not explain
how objective results appear in experiments and what an instantaneous change in
the so-called information vector (or catalog of knowledge) really means during
the measurement. On the other hand, Brukner and Zeilinger's definition of a new
measure of information may lose its significance, when the spin measurement of
an elementary system is treated realistically. Hence, the sum of the individual
measures of information may not be a conserved value in real experiments.

association of the quantum state vector with each individual physical system in
an attributive way is a source of many false paradoxes and inconsistencies. The
paradoxes are avoided if the purely statistical interpretation (SI) of the
quantum state vector is adopted. According the SI the quantum theory (QT) does
not provide any deterministic prediction for any individual experimental result
obtained for a free physical system, for a trapped ion or for a quantum dot. In
this article it is shown that if the SI is used then, contrary to the general
belief, the QT does not predict for the ideal spin singlet state perfect
anti-correlation of the coincidence coumts for the distant detectors.
Subsequently the various proofs of the Bell's theorem are reanalyzed and in
particular the importance and the implications of the use of the unique
probability space in these proofs are elucidated. The use of the unique
probability space is shown to be equivalent to the use of the joint probability
distributions for the non commuting observables. The experimental violation of
the Bell's inequalities proves that the naive realistic particle like spatio-
temporal description of the various quantum mechanical experiments is
impossible. Of course it does not give any argument for the action at the
distance and it does not provide the proof of the completeness of the QM. The
fact that the quantum state vector is not an attribute of a single quantum
system and that the quantum observables are contextual has to be taken properly
into account in any implementation of the quantum computing device.

theorem is that any pair of authorized sets in an access structure should
overlap. From the viewpoint of application, this places an unnatural constraint
on secret sharing. We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS),
where access structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is
permissible, provided some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show
that no more than $\lambda-1$ withheld shares are required, where $\lambda$ is
the minimum number of {\em partially linked classes} among the authorized sets
for the QSS. This is useful in QSS schemes where the share dealer is honest by
definition and is equivalent to a secret reconstructor. Our result means that
such applications of QSS need not be thwarted by the no-cloning theorem.
