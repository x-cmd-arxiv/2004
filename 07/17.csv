  Symp (""Planets to Cosmology"")",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We describe our surveys of low column density Lyman-alpha absorbers [N(HI) =
10^(12.5-16.0) cm^-2], which show that the warm photoionized IGM contains 30%
of all baryons at z < 0.1. This fraction is consistent with cosmological
simulations, which also predict that an additional 20-40% of the baryons reside
in hotter 10^(5-7) K gas, the warm-hot IGM (WHIM). The observed line density of
Lya absorbers, dN/dz = 170 for N(HI) > 10^(12.8) cm^-2, is dominated by
low-N(HI) systems that exhibit slower redshift evolution than those with N(HI)
>10^(14). HST/FUSE surveys of OVI absorbers, together with recent detections of
O VII with Chandra and XMM/Newton, suggest that 20-70% of all baryons could
reside in the WHIM, depending on its assumed abundance (O/H = 10% solar). At
the highest column densities, N(HI) > 10^(20.3), the damped Lya systems are
often identified with gas-rich disks of galaxies over a large range in
luminosities (0.03-1 L*) and morphologies. Lyman-limit systems [N(HI) =
10^(17.3-20.3)] appear to be associated with bound, bright (0.1-0.3 L*) galaxy
halos. The Lya absorbers with N(HI) = 10^(13-16) cm^-2 are associated with
filaments of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution, although some
may arise in unbound winds from dwarf galaxies. Our discovery that ~20% of
low-z Lya absorbers reside in galaxy voids suggests that a substantial fraction
of baryons may be entirely unrelated to galaxies. In the future, Hubble (and
FUSE) can provide a census of the local baryons and the distribution of heavy
elements in the IGM. These studies can be conducted quite efficiently if NASA
can install the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on Hubble, allowing an
order-of-magnitude improvement in throughput and a comparable increase in our
ability to study the IGM.

If, as we argue, the flat X-ray spectra from two parts of k25 are synchrotron

magnetospheres are often based on 1-D characteristics. In particular, the
plasma wave polarizations that can be propagated along the 1-D characteristics
determine the time evolution of the entire system. There are two sets of
characteristics,corresponding to the fast and Alfven modes. The fast wave is
generally considered to be a transverse light wave, however recently it has
been claimed that light-like fast waves can transport a longitudinal electric
polarization, $E_{\parallel}$, at the speed of light. The implication is quite
profound if true, namely that the wrong information has been propagated along
the fast characteristics in all previous simulations of force-free
magnetospheres. It is shown in this Letter that the light-like fast waves must
be transverse and previous simulations are valid. This result is demonstrated
by means of a fundamental physical principle (associated with the fact that
particles cannot flow faster than the speed of light), there exists a charge
horizon in ffde magnetospheres. It is shown that the Alfven critical surfaces
in a ffde magnetosphere are both charge and particle horizons, i.e. one way
membranes that do not permit traversal by charges nor particles anti-directed
to the bulk flow. Since the propagation of a discontinuous change in
$E_{\parallel}$ requires a physical surface charge on the wave-face, it is also
a one-way membrane for longitudinally polarized waves. Besides justifying
previous ffde simulations this result also invalidates previous claims that
fast waves can radiate $E_{\parallel}$ from the event horizon of a black hole.

fitting orbit has an orbital period of P = 312+/-3 days. The orbital
eccentricity is e = 0.45+/-0.03 and the semimajor axis is a = 8,010+/-80 km.
The mass of the system is surprisingly low at 0.42+/-0.02 x 10^18 kg. To

density of 1000 kg m^-3 we find a red geometric albedo of p_R = 0.37, an order
of magnitude higher than has been generally assumed for transneptunian objects.

estimates of the mass of the belt must be significantly reduced. The semimajor

strikingly similar to this same ratio in other transneptunian binaries,

heating cannot be directly determined, but the cooling can be inferred from
observations of C II*, which is an important coolant in different environments.
The amount of cooling can be measured through either the intensity of the 157.7
\micron [C II] emission line or the C II* absorption lines at 1037.018 \AA\ and
1335.708 \AA, observable with FUSE and HST/STIS, respectively. We present the
results of a survey of these far-UV absorption lines in 43 objects situated at
|b|>30. We derive the cooling rates and analyze the ionization structure, the
depletion, and metallicity content from the column densities of C II*, S II, P
II, Fe II, and H I 21-cm emission for the low-, intermediate-, and
high-velocity clouds (LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs) along the different sightlines.
Based on the depletion and the ionization structure, the LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs
consist mostly of warm neutral and ionized clouds. For the LVCs, the mean
cooling rate in erg\,s^{-1} per H atom is -25.70^{+0.19}_{-0.36} dex. The
corresponding total Galactic C II luminosity in the 157.7 \micron emission line
is L~2.6x10^7 L_\sun. Combining N(C II*) with the intensity of H$\alpha$
emission, we derive that ~50% of the C II* radiative cooling comes from the
warm ionized medium (WIM). The large dispersion in the cooling rates is
certainly due to a combination of differences in the ionization fraction, in
the dust-to-gas fraction, and physical conditions between sightlines. For the
IVC IV Arch at z~1 kpc we find that on average the cooling is a factor 2 lower
than in the LVCs that probe gas at lower z. For an HVC (Complex C, at z > 6
kpc) we find the much lower rate of -26.99^{+0.21}_{-0.53} dex. [Abridged]

Circulation flows are consistent with (1) the failure to observe cooling gas in

(3) the accumulation of iron in the hot gas from Type Ia supernovae in the
central galaxy. Dense inflowing gas cools, producing a positive central
temperature gradient, as in normal cooling flows. Bubbles of hot, buoyant gas
flow outward. Circulation flows eventually cool catastrophically if the outward
flowing gas transports mass but no heat; to maintain the circulation both mass
and energy must be supplied to the inflowing gas over a large volume, extending
to the cooling radius. The rapid radial recirculation of gas produces a flat
central core in the gas iron abundance, similar to many observations. We
believe the circulation flows described here are the first gasdynamic,
long-term evolutionary models that are in good agreement with all essential
features observed in the hot gas: little or no gas cools as required by XMM

enable an effective deposition rate variation along the surface. In this way we
experimentally mimic the effect of the atomic flux modulation created by

self organization of gallium atoms on the surface, we conclude that the
nano-islands are not affected by surface diffusion processes and the effective
variation of the deposition rate per unit area is the dominant factor affecting
the growth differences along the surface. This result demonstrates that the

shells are studied numerically for various interactions between the particles.
Three distinct correlation regimes are defined, depending on the short-range
behavior of the pair pseudopotential. For pseudopotentials similar to those of
electrons in the first excited Landau level, correlations at half-filling have
a simple three-body form consisting of the maximum avoidance of the triplet
state with the smallest relative angular momentum R_3=3. In analogy to the
superharmonic criterion for Laughlin two-body correlations, their occurrence is
related to the form of the three-body pseudopotential at short range. The
spectra of a model three-body repulsion are calculated, and the zero-energy
Moore--Read ground state, its +-e/4-charged quasiparticles, and the
magnetoroton and pair-breaking bands are all identified. The quasiparticles are
correctly described by a composite fermion model appropriate for Halperin's
p-type pairing with Laughlin correlations between the pairs. However, the
Moore--Read ground state, and specially its excitations, have small overlaps
with the corresponding Coulomb eigenstates when calculated on a sphere. The
reason lies in surface curvature which affects the form of pair pseudopotential
for which the ""R_3>3"" three-body correlations occur. In finite systems, such
pseudopotential must be slightly superharmonic at short range (different from
Coulomb pseudopotential). However, the connection with the three-body
pseudopotential is less size-dependent, suggesting that the Moore--Read state
and its excitations are a more accurate description for experimental nu=5/2
states than could be expected from previous calculations.

of vacuum chiral perturbation theory can be applied. This is due to the fact
that the thermal effects of the heavy modes are Boltzmann suppressed. The
present work is concerned with the situation of higher temperatures, but still
below the chiral transition. For a systematic approach it would be desirable to
have a temperature modified chiral perturbation theory at hand which would
yield a chiral power counting scheme. It is shown that this cannot be obtained.
In principle, chiral perturbation theory emerges from QCD by (a) integrating
out all degrees of freedom besides the Goldstone bosons and (b) expanding the
obtained non-local action in terms of derivatives. It is shown that at finite
temperature step (b) cannot be carried out due to non-analyticities appearing
for vanishing four-momenta. Therefore one cannot obtain a local Lagrangian for
the Goldstone boson fields with temperature modified coupling constants. The
importance of the non-analyticities is estimated.

with an arbitrary tetrahedral curve, there is a particular reduction that
produces a smaller tetrahedral curve and preserves the even liaison class. We
call the curves that are minimal with respect to this reduction S-minimal
curves. Given a tetrahedral curve, we describe a simple algorithm (involving

This resolution is always linear. This result allows us to classify the

allows us to conclude that an S-minimal curve is minimal in its even liaison
class; that is, the whole even liaison class can be built up from the S-minimal

introduced new modules and obtained an integer and torsion thoery for the

we would have a limitation on the index of absolute ramification.

structures is analytically calculated in two ways. The first method is based on
the fact that a transmission of unity leads to a coincidence of all still
competing tunneling time definitions. Thus, having an indisputable resonant
tunneling time $\tau_{res},$ we apply the natural definition
$v_{res}=L/\tau_{res}$ to calculate the velocity. For the second method we
combine Bloch's theorem with the transfer matrix approach to decompose the wave
function into two Bloch waves. Then the expectation value of the velocity is
calculated. Both different approaches lead to the same result, showing their
physical equivalence. The obtained resonant tunneling velocity $v_{res}$ is
smaller or equal to the group velocity times the magnitude of the complex
transmission amplitude of the unit cell. Only at energies where the unit cell
of the periodic structure has a transmission of unity $v_{res}$ equals the
group velocity. Numerical calculations for a GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice are
performed. For typical parameters the resonant velocity is below one third of
the group velocity.
