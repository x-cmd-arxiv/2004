observed 24 times during the GPS thus covering many orbital phases including
the pre-periastron flare. The source is clearly detected in all Integral
instruments in most pointings. The derived X-ray light curves show strong
variability on all timescales. Depending on the orbital phase of the pointings,
the luminosity changes by factor of more than 10 during the pre-periastron

revisited, and it is shown that the conventional belief, that it can be solved
by a combination of clumping of the wind and multiple scattering of photons, is
not self-consistent for optically thick clumps. Clumping does reduce the mass
loss rate mdot, and hence the momentum supply, required to generate a specified
radio emission measure \varepsilon, while multiple scattering increases the
delivery of momentum from a specified stellar luminosity L. However, in the
case of thick clumps, when combined the two effects act in opposition rather
than in unison since clumping reduces multiple scattering. Thus the ratio of
momentum deliverable to momentum required is maximal for a smooth wind and the
momentum problem remains for the thick clump case. In the case of thin clumps,
all of the benefit of clumping in reducing \eta lies in reducing \mdot for a
given \varepsilon so that extremely small filling factors f = 10e-4 are needed.
It is also shown that clumping affects the inference of \mdot from radio
\varepsilon not only by changing the emission measure per unit mass but also by
changing the radio optical depth unity radius R_{rad}, and hence the observed
wind volume, at radio wavelengths.

significant radial migration and eccentricity pumping of both planets occurs
predominantly by 2:1 and 5:3 mean motion resonant interactions. Using
Laplace-Lagrange secular theory, we obtain analytical secular solutions for the

to distinguish between the secular and resonant dynamics which arise in
numerical simulations. We also illustrate how encounter maps, typically used to
trace the motion of massless particles, may be modified to reproduce the gross

promising future use of such maps to model the dynamics of more coplanar

Galactic center (GC) exhibits a surprisingly flat behavior in the ~ 3 to 8
micron region, contrary to the deep minimum expected from standard interstellar
dust models consisting of bare silicate and graphite dust particles. We show
that this extinction is likely caused by the presence of metallic needles in
the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic center. If the needles
contribute only to the 3 - 8 micron extinction, they must have a long
wavelength cutoff at ~ 8 microns, and therefore a typical length over radius
ratio of about 600, smaller than the 3000 aspect ratio determined for the
needles in Cas A. Homogeneously distributed throughout the ISM, they comprise
only a minor mass fraction of the ISM, with a needle-to-H mass ratio of
\~5x10^{-6}, which is equivalent to 0.14% of the silicate dust mass. Their
total ISM abundance can then be readily explained by the combined production in
SNe and O-rich stellar outflows. It is currently unclear how universal the GC
extinction law is. Local 2 - 5 micron extinction measurements seem to be
consistent with the standard extinction law, suggesting a non uniform
distribution of needles in the ISM. The GC observations show that metallic
needles, in spite of their low abundance or non uniform distribution, can be
the dominant source of opacity in the 3 - 8 micron wavelength region. However,
expelled into the intergalactic medium, their abundance is too low to cause any
dimming of cosmological sources, and their length is too short to make them a
significant source of submillimeter emission.

in the EPIC-pn camera in the 0.5-10 keV energy band (3.7 mCrab). Using the
earlier established best-fit orbital period of 40.0741+/-0.0005 minutes from
RXTE observations and considering a circular binary orbit as first
approximation, we derived a value of 4.8+/-0.1 lt-ms for the projected orbital
radius of the binary system and an epoch of the orbital phase of MJD
52720.67415(16). The barycentric mean spin period of the pulsar was derived as
5.2459427+/-0.0000004 ms. The pulsar's spin-pulse profile showed a prominent
(1.5 ms FWHM) pulse, with energy and orbital phase dependence in the amplitude
and shape. The measured pulsed fraction in four energy bands was found to be
3.1+/-0.2 % (0.5-3.0 keV), 5.4+/-0.4 % (3.0-6.0 keV), 5.1+/-0.7 % (6.0-10.0
keV) and 3.7+/-0.2 % (0.5-10.0 keV), respectively. Studies of spin-profiles
with orbital phase and energy showed significant increase in its pulsed
fraction during the second observed orbit of the neutron star, gradually
declining in the subsequent two orbits, which was associated with sudden but
marginal increase in mass accretion. From our investigations of orbital
parameters and estimation of other properties of this compact binary system, we
conclude that XTE J1807-294 is very likely a candidate for a millisecond radio
pulsar.

Principal Component Analysis. We find this is a very efficient way to describe
many aspects of RRab light curve structure: in many cases, a Principal
Component fit with 9 parameters can describe a RRab light curve including bumps
whereas a 17 parameter Fourier fit is needed. As a consequence we show
statistically why the amplitude is also a good summary of the structure of a RR
Lyrae light curve. We also use our analysis to derive an empirical relation
relating absolute magnitude to light curve structure. In comparing this formula
to those derived from exactly the same dataset but using Fourier parameters, we
find that the Principal Component Analysis approach has disticnt advantages.
These advantages are, firstly, that the errors on the coefficients in such
formulae are smaller, and secondly, that the correlation between Principal
Components is significantly smaller than the correlation between Fourier
amplitudes. These two factors lead to reduced formal errors, in some cases
estimated to be a factor of 2, on the eventual fitted value of the absolute
magnitude. This technique will prove very useful in the analysis of data from

two-dimensional-Ising characters. For large values of $U$ and $V$ we get a
direct, first-order, MI-MDW transition. The MI-SF, MDW-SF and MI-MDW phase
boundaries join at a bicritical point at ($U, V) = (8.5 \pm 0.05, 4.75 \pm
0.05)$.

network ensemble, and derive the general expression for the force distribution

analysis. Since technically the problem can be written as a non-invertible
matrix problem (where the matrix is determined by the contact geometry), we
study what happens if we perturb the packing matrix or replace it by a random
matrix. The resulting $P(f)$'s differ significantly from those of normal
packings, which touches upon the deep question of how network statistics is
related to the underlying network structure. Overall, the ensemble formulation
opens up a new perspective on force networks that is analytically accessible,

measurements, and transport measurements on mesoscopic samples have proved that
two level systems (TLSs) have a crucial role in the low temperature thermal and
electric properties of disordered systems. This paper is aimed at reviewing the
role of slow TLSs in point contacts. First the theory of point contacts is
summarized, concentrating on the discussion of different point contact models,
and on the different regimes of electron flow in the contact, mainly focusing
on the ballistic and diffusive limit. The Boltzmann equation is solved in both
regimes, and the position dependence of the electrical potential is determined.
Then the scattering processes in point contacts are investigated, particularly
concentrating on the scattering on slow TLSs. If the the electron assisted
transitions between the two states are negligible the electron-two level system
interaction can be treated with a simplified Hamiltonian. The scattering on
such slow TLSs causes nonlinearity in the current-voltage characteristics of
the point contact, which can be determined using Fermi's golden role. These
calculations are presented showing both the contribution of elastic and
inelastic scattering, and including the dependence on the position of the TLS,
and on the effect of high frequency irradiation. These results are used to
discuss the differences between these slow TLSs and the fast centers which may
be described by the two channel Kondo model. The available experimental results
are analyzed, distinguishing between the effects due to the different types of
TLSs.

models containing two tilted $\gamma$-law perfect fluids. The full state space
is 11-dimensional, but the existence of a monotonic function simplifies the
analysis considerably. We restrict attention to a particular, physically
interesting, invariant subspace and find all equilibrium points that are future
stable in the full 11-dimensional state space; these are consequently local
attractors and serve as late-time asymptotes for an open set of tilted type
VI$_0$ models containing two tilted fluids. We find that if one of the fluids
has an equation of state parameter $\gamma<6/5$, the stiffest fluid will be
dynamically insignificant at late times. For the value $\gamma=6/5$ there is a
2-dimensional bifurcation set, and if both fluids are stiffer than $\gamma=6/5$
both fluids will have extreme tilt asymptotically. We investigate the case in
which one fluid is extremely tilting in detail. We also consider the case with
one stiff fluid ($\gamma=2$) close to the initial singularity, and find that
the chaotic behaviour which occurs in general Bianchi models with $\gamma<2$ is
suppressed.

method, assuming only that two relevant tree amplitudes factorize and that
their relative strong phase, delta_t, is negligible. The other method, based on
broken flavor SU(3), permits a determination of alpha in B^0-> rho^\pm pi^\mp
in an overconstrained system using also rate measurements of B^{0,+}-> K^* pi
and B^{0,+}->rho K. Current data are shown to restrict two ratios of penguin

bound |alpha_{eff} - alpha| < 15 degrees. Assuming that delta_t is much smaller
than 90 degrees, we find alpha =(93\pm 16) degrees and (102 \pm 20) degrees
using BABAR and BELLE results for B(t)-> rho^\pm pi^mp. Avoiding this
assumption for completeness, we demonstrate the reduction of discrete
ambiguities in alpha with increased statistics, and show that SU(3) breaking

the class of theories with an hierarchical structure for the Yukawa couplings
the K\""{a}hler corrections to both the masses and mixing angles are
subdominant. This is true even in cases that texture zeros are filled in by the
terms coming from the K\""{a}hler potential.

the precision of our recently-developed strongly modulating control fields. The
results were analyzed in an attempt to decompose the implementation errors into
coherent (overall systematic), incoherent (microscopically deterministic), and
decoherent (microscopically random) components. This analysis yielded a
superoperator consisting of a unitary part that was strongly correlated with
the theoretically expected unitary superoperator of the quantum Fourier
transform, an overall attenuation consistent with decoherence, and a residual
portion that was not completely positive - although complete positivity is
required for any quantum operation. By comparison with the results of computer
simulations, the lack of complete positivity was shown to be largely a
consequence of the incoherent errors during the quantum process tomography
procedure. These simulations further showed that coherent, incoherent, and
decoherent errors can often be identified by their distinctive effects on the
spectrum of the overall superoperator. The gate fidelity of the experimentally
determined superoperator was 0.64, while the correlation coefficient between
experimentally determined superoperator and the simulated superoperator was

A, 71, 032320 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.71.032320",,"quant-ph",,"  Typically linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) models assume that all
input photons are completely indistinguishable. In practice there will
inevitably be non-idealities associated with the photons and the experimental
setup which will introduce a degree of distinguishability between photons. We
consider a non-deterministic optical controlled-NOT gate, a fundamental LOQC
gate, and examine the effect of temporal and spectral distinguishability on its
operation. We also consider the effect of utilizing non-ideal photon counters,
which have finite bandwidth and time response.

  Programming Languages, July 12-13, 2004, Turku, Finland",,,,"quant-ph cs.PL",,"  Full formal descriptions of algorithms making use of quantum principles must
take into account both quantum and classical computing components and assemble
them so that they communicate and cooperate. Moreover, to model concurrent and
distributed quantum computations, as well as quantum communication protocols,
quantum to quantum communications which move qubits physically from one place
to another must also be taken into account. Inspired by classical process
algebras, which provide a framework for modeling cooperating computations, a
process algebraic notation is defined, named QPAlg for Quantum Process Algebra,
which provides a homogeneous style to formal descriptions of concurrent and
distributed computations comprising both quantum and classical parts. On the
quantum side, QPAlg provides quantum variables, operations on quantum variables
(unitary operators and measurement observables), as well as new forms of
communications involving the quantum world. The operational semantics makes
sure that these quantum objects, operations and communications operate
according to the postulates of quantum mechanics.

particular, we introduce the quantum Stokes parameters to describe the quantum
self- and cross-correlations between two polarization components of the
electromagnetic field generated by this type of lasers. We calculate
analytically the fluctuation spectra of these parameters and discuss
experiments in which they can be measured. We demonstrate that in certain
situations VCSELs can exhibit polarization squeezing over some range of
spectral frequencies. This polarization squeezing has its origin in
sub-Poissonian pumping statistics of the active laser medium.

CQTM, unitary transformations and measurements are allowed. We show that any

classical and quantum computations, already pointed out in the framework of
measurement-based quantum computation is confirmed. To appreciate the
similarity of programming classical TM and CQTM, examples are given.
