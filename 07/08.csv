the metallicity of the Lyman alpha forest, using a set of high resolution
hydrodynamic simulations of a Lambda cold dark matter model. Simulations
produce metals self-consistently, based on one single parameter, the metal
yield, which in turn is constrained by metallicity in the intra-cluster gas. We
follow metals as a separate density species. For the metallicity of Lyman alpha
clouds with column density of N_{HI}~10^{14.5}-10^{15.5}/cm^2 at z=2-4 we find
reasonable agreement between simulations, both with and without GSW, and
observations (Schaye et al). A unique signature and sensitive test of GSW is,
however, provided by lower density regions with gas density of \rho/<\rho> =
0.01-1.0 and a corresponding column density of 10^{12}-10^{14}/cm^2. Without
GSW we predict that both the mean and median metallicity of \lya clouds in this
column density range at z=2-4 should have Z<10^{3}Zsun, since these small
systems support little star formation. GSW contaminate these regions, however,
and also there is a significant fraction (~25%) of Lyman alpha clouds in this
column density range which have a high metallicity excess of 10^{-2}Zsun,
resulting in a mean metallicity of ~10^{-2}Zsun. In addition, we find that
there is a minimum in the median metallicity for clouds of
N_{HI}~10^{13}-10^{14}/cm^2 in the case with GSW, whereas without GSW the
metallicity decreases monotonically and rapidly with decreasing column density.
Finally, we predict that the ratio of secondary (e.g., N) to primary metals
(e.g., O,C) is expected to be smaller by a factor of 10 in clouds of
N_{HI}~10^{14.5}/cm^2 compared to that in large galaxies; this factor increases
to >50 for N_{HI}< 10^{13.5}/cm^2.

phenomena. These range from nuclear processes on the stellar surface to
processes in electron degenerate matter at subnuclear densities to boson
condensates and the existence of new states of baryonic matter--like color
superconducting quark matter--at supernuclear densities. More than that,
according to the strange matter hypothesis strange quark matter could be more
stable than nuclear matter, in which case neutron stars should be largely

phenomenology of strange quark matter. Possible observational signatures
associated with the theoretically proposed states of matter inside compact

newly-forming dwarf galaxy condensing out of the tidal debris removed from the

forming from returning gaseous tidal tail material, we infer a dynamically
young age similar to its star-formation age, and suggests it is in the earliest

input to the clouds by Type II and Type Ia supernovae. We utilize
metallicity-dependent yields for all elements at all times, and include effects
of finite stellar lifetimes. We derive the metallicity distribution functions
for stars in the clouds, their age-metallicity relation, and relative elemental
abundances for a number of alpha- and Fe-group elements. The stability of these
clouds against destruction is discussed, and results are compared for different
initial mass functions. We find that the dispersion of the metallicity
distribution function observed in the outer halo is naturally reproduced by
contributions from many clouds with different initial conditions. The predicted
relative abundances of some alpha- and Fe-group elements show reasonable
agreement with the observed values down to metallicities below [Fe/H] ~ -4 when
the iron yields are reduced relative to stellar models. The observed scatter is
also reproduced for most elements including the observed bifurcation in
[alpha/Fe] for stars with low [Fe/H]. However, the predicted dispersion may be
too large for some elements unless a limited range of progenitor masses
contributing to the abundances of these elements is assumed. The results
suggest that the low-mass end of SNeII was probably absent at the very lowest

several popular methods and the bolometric luminosities from the
multi-wavelength continuum. This allows us to estimate the Eddington ratio
(${\cal E}\equiv L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$) so that the undergoing physical
processes can be tested via hard X-ray data. We find a strong correlation
between ${\cal F}_{\rm X}\equiv L_{\rm 2-10keV}/L_{\rm Bol}$ and ${\cal E}$ as
${\cal F}_{\rm X}\propto {\cal E}^{-0.64}$ with a multivariate regression. This
indicates that the release of gravitational energy in the hot corona is
controlled by the Eddington ratio. On the other hand, the correlation between
the hard X-ray spectral index ($\Gamma$) and ${\cal E}$ depends critically on
the types of objects: $\Gamma$ is nearly constant ($\Gamma \propto {\cal E}^0$)
in broad-line Seyfert 1's (BLS1s), whereas $\Gamma \propto \log {\cal
E}^{0.18}$ in narrow-line Seyfert 1's (NLS1s), although not very significant.
We can set constraints on the forms of magnetic stress tensor on the condition
that ${\cal F}_{\rm X}$ is proportional to the fraction $f$ of gravitational
energy dissipated in the hot corona and that $f$ is proportional to magnetic
energy density in the disk. We find that the shear stress tensor
$t_{r\phi}\propto P_{\rm gas}$ is favored by the correlation in the present

tremendous progress in the study of luminous extragalactic H$_2$O emission.
Single-dish monitoring and high resolution interferometry have been used to
identify sites of massive star formation, to study the interaction of nuclear
jets with dense molecular gas and to investigate the circumnuclear environment
of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Accretion disks with radii of 0.1--3 pc were
mapped and masses of nuclear engines of order 10$^{6}$--10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$
were determined. So far, $\sim$50 extragalactic H$_2$O maser sources have been
detected, but few have been studied in detail.

should not be naively interpreted as implying that the intergalactic medium
(IGM) had been reionized at higher redsifts. We show that a cluster of faint
undetected sources around each observed galaxy generates an HII region
sufficiently large to allow transmission of the galaxy's Lyman-alpha line prior
to reionization. We also show that quasars may contribute a significant
fraction of the ionizing photons to HII regions around galaxies with a velocity
dispersion larger than ~100km/s. These contributing quasars are not usually
seen due to the small fraction of time they spend in a luminous phase.

in 2002. The observations resulted in almost evenly sampled light curves, 3-8
hours long, with an average sampling interval of ~5-15 min. Because of the
dense sampling and the availability of light curves in more than one optical
bands we are able to study the intra-night flux and spectral variability of the
source in detail. Significant observations were observed in all but one cases.
On average, the flux variability amplitude, on time scales of minutes/hours,
increases from ~2-3% in the I, to ~3.5-5.5% in the B band light curves. We do
not detect any flares within the individual light curves. However, there is a
possibility that the April 2001 and late May 2002 observations sample two
flares which lasted longer than ~1-3 days. The evidence is only suggestive
though, due to the limited length of the present light curves with regard to
the duration of the assumed flares. No spectral variations are detected during
the April 2001 observations. The source flux rises and decays with the same
rate, in all bands. This variability behaviour is typical of S4 0954+658, and
is attributed to geometrical effects. However, significant spectral variations
are observed in May 2002. We find that the spectrum hardens/softens as the flux
increases/decreases, respectively. Furthermore, the ""hardening"" rate of the
energy spectrum is faster than the rate with which the spectrum becomes
""redder"" as the flux decays. We also find evidence (although of low statistical
significance) that the I band variations are delayed with respect to the B band
variations. If the May 2002 observations sample a flaring event, these results
suggest that the variations are caused by energetic processes which are
associated with the particle cooling and the source light travel time scales.

on 2002 April 27, three days before BeppoSAX was switched off. The event was
detected with the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras but not with the Gamma ray Burst
Monitor. A follow-up observation with the BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments was
soon performed and a candidate afterglow source was discovered. We present the
results obtained. We also include the results obtained from the observations of
the XRF field with the Chandra X-ray satellite. The spectral analysis of the
prompt emission shows that the peak energy of the EF(E) spectrum is lower than
5.5 keV, with negligible spectral evolution. The X-ray afterglow spectrum is
consistent with a power law model with photon index of about 2, while the 2-10
keV flux fades as a power law with a decay index -1.33. Both these indices are
typical of GRBs. A very marginal excess around 4.5-5 keV is found in the
afterglow spectrum measured by BeppoSAX . As for many GRBs, the extrapolation
of the 2-10 keV fading law back to the time of the prompt emission is
consistent with the X-ray flux measured during the second part of the event. We
estimate a possible range of values of the redshift and discuss our results in
the light of current models of XRFs.

Ionised Boundary Layer (IBL) of the BRCs. A total of 25 clouds display 20 cm
radio continuum emission that is associated with their bright optical rims. The
ionising photon flux illuminating these clouds, the ionised gas pressure and
the electron density of the IBL are determined. We derive internal molecular
pressures for 9 clouds using molecular line data from the literature and
compare these pressures to the IBL pressures to determine the pressure balance
of the clouds. We find three clouds in which the pressure exerted by their IBLs
is much greater than that measured in the internal molecular material. A
comparison of external pressures around the remaining clouds to a global mean
internal pressure shows that the majority of clouds can be expected to be in
pressure equilibrium with their IBLs and hence are likely to be currently
shocked by photoionisation shocks. We identify one source which shows 20 cm
emission consistent with that of an embedded high-mass YSO and confirm its
association with a known infrared stellar cluster. This embedded cluster is
shown to contain early-type B stars, implying that at least some BRCs are
intimately involved in intermediate to high mass star formation.

neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Comparing the distances derived
for the neutron stars CygX-2 and XTE J2123-058 using the observed Eddington
limited photospheric radius expansion bursts with the distances derived using
the observed radius and effective temperature of the companion star we find
that the latter are smaller by approximately a factor of 1.5-2. The latter
method is often employed to determine the distance to BH LMXBs. A possible
explanation for this discrepancy is that the stellar absorption lines in fast
rotating companion stars are different from those in the slowly rotating
template stars as was found before for early type stars. This could lead to a
systematic mis-classification of the spectral type of the companion star, which
in turn would yield a systematic error in the distance. We find that, using new
distances for XTE J1550-564 and V404 Cyg, the maximum outburst luminosity for
at least 5 but perhaps even 7 of the 15 BH soft X-ray transients exceeds the
Eddington luminosity for a 10 M_sun BH showing that these systems would be
classified as ultra-luminous X-ray sources had we observed them in other
Galaxies. This renders support for the idea that many ultra-luminous X-ray
sources are stellar-mass rather than intermediate-mass BHs. We find that the
rms value of the distance to the Galactic plane for BHs is consistent with that
of neutron star LMXBs. This suggests that BHs could also receive a
kick-velocity during their formation although this has to be investigated in
more detail. (Abridged).

assumed temperature but generally increases from 30 ppb at the condensation
altitude (~83 km) to 5 ppm at ~300 km. Further, the central core of the HCN

temperature increases with altitude. The isotopic ratios are determined to be
12C/13C=132+/-25 and 14N/15N=94+/-13 assuming the Coustenis & Bezard (1995)

formation rate (SFR) out to a redshift around unity is well established. Beyond
z~1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is flat or even increasing,
contrary to early indications of a turnover. Some recent analyses of z~6
photometric dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z=3 to z~6, but there is
still very little constraint on the extent of dust obscuration at such high
redshifts. In less than a decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density
spanning z=0 to as high as z~6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of
galaxy evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is
presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found to be
consistent to within factors of about three over essentially the entire range
$0<z\lesssim6$, and it can be used to constrain the evolution of the luminosity
function (LF) for star forming (SF) galaxies. The LF evolution for SF galaxies
has been previously explored using optical source counts, as well as radio
source counts at 1.4 GHz, and a well-known degeneracy between luminosity
evolution ($L\propto(1+z)^Q$) and density evolution ($\phi\propto(1+z)^P$) is
found. Combining the constraints from the global SFR density evolution with
those from the 1.4 GHz radio source counts at sub-millijansky levels allows
this degeneracy to be broken, and a best fitting evolutionary form to be
established. The preferred evolution in a $H_0=70, \Omega_M=0.3,
\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$ cosmology from these combined constraints is
$Q=2.70\pm0.60$, $P=0.15\pm0.60$.

zero, one or two electrons. Vacuum and double occupation states have the same

potential energy. A single dot initially decoupled from the others is weakly
coupled with an external element (Bob), where a pair of electrons has been
previously localized. Because of hopping after a suitable time the two dots
charge states become maximally entangled. Another chain dot (Alice) is put in
an unknown superposition of vacuum and double occupation states, and the other
dots are initially empty. The time evolution of the system involves an electron
diffusive process. A post selection procedure represented by the detection of
charge pairs in a region of the chain equidistant from Alice and Bob, allows,
if successful, the reconstruction on the Bob site of the unknown state
initially encoded by Alice. The peculiar feature of the model is that the
introduction of a trapped magnetic field strongly improves the process
efficiency.

(e.g. phosphorus) in Si are ideally suited candidates for qubits in such
proposals, where shallow donor exchange gates are frequently invoked to perform
two-qubit operations. An important potential problem in this context is that
intervalley interference originating from the degeneracy in the Si
conduction-band edge causes fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which
imposes significant constraints on the Si quantum-computer architecture. We
discuss the theoretical origin of such oscillations. Considering two
substitutional donors in Si, we present a systematic statistical study of the
correlation between relative position distributions and the resulting exchange
distributions.

studies. Yet both theories EW and KPZ contain an unphysical feature. When
deposition of material is stopped both theories predict that as time tends to

not flat, but simply has no gradients larger than the gradient related to the

the consequences for the simpler system which is a modification of the EW

the Kondo problem in metallic carbon nanotubes by linear and non-linear

inhomogeneity, defining the length, time and energy scales of the relevant
elementary excitations. The dynamics of the objects below and above Tc are
examined in detail with femtosecond spectroscopy and compared with magnetic and
other measurements. The dynamically inhomogeneous state is described
theoretically by considering an interaction between electrons, spins and the
lattice. By symmetry, only electrons in degenerate states can couple to the
lattice and spins to give an anisotropic, d-wave symmetry interaction. The
proposed interaction acts on a mesoscopic length-scale, taking into account the
interplay of Coulomb repulsion between particles and anisotropic elastic
strain, and leads to the formation of bipolaron pairs and stripes. The
predicted symmetry breaking associated with pairing and stripe formation are
observed in numerous experiments. The phenomenology associated with the
co-existence of pairs and clusters (stripes) is found to apply to many
different experiments ranging from femtosecond dynamics to transport
measurements. Excitations of the system are described quite well in terms of a
2-level system, although we find that a complete description may require a more
complicated energy landscape due to presence of mesoscopic objects such as
stripes or clusters. The formation of the superconducting state can be
understood quantitatively to be the result of the establishment of phase

earthquake interaction and triggering based on two simple ingredients: (i) a
seismic rupture results from activated processes giving an exponential
dependence on the local stress; (ii) the stress relaxation has a long memory.
The combination of these two effects predicts in a rather general way that
seismic decay rates after mainshocks follow the Omori law 1/t^p with exponents
p linearly increasing with the magnitude M of the mainshock and the inverse
temperature. We carefully test the prediction on the magnitude dependence of p
by a detailed analysis of earthquake sequences in the Southern California
Earthquake catalog. We find power law relaxations of seismic sequences
triggered by mainshocks with exponents p increasing with the mainshock
magnitude by approximately 0.1-0.15 for each magnitude unit increase, from
p(M=3) \approx 0.6 to p(M=7) \approx 1.1, in good agreement with the prediction
of the multifractal model. The results are robust with respect to different
time intervals, magnitude ranges and declustering methods. When applied to
synthetic catalogs generated by the ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence)
model constituting a strong null hypothesis with built-in magnitude-independent
$p$-values, our procedure recovers the correct magnitude-independent p-values.
Our analysis thus suggests that a new important fact of seismicity has been
unearthed. We discuss alternative interpretations of the data and describe
other predictions of the model.

existing decommissioned computers, the campus network, and a script-based,

an important property -- the ADM mass of the solution is suppressed compared to
the bare mass of a static source. This screening of the mass is due to
nonlinear interactions which give rise to a nonzero curvature outside the
source. The curvature extends away from the source to a certain macroscopic
distance that coincides with the would-be strong interaction scale. The very
same curvature shields the source from strong coupling effects. The four

recovered at observable distances. We find that the solution has no vDVZ

kind of Mach's principle for spinning frames-or the Ptolemaic (geocentric)
theory to confuse a rotating frame with an inertial frame.
  Furthermore, we review classical experimental backgrounds for general
relativity, and discuss possible solutions for paradoxes in quantum gravity.
  Taking angular momentums into account to improve above discussions, we can
explain the smallness of neutrino mass without assuming the see-saw mechanism.
A natural geometric interpretation of the quark flavor mixing angle is added in
the Conclusion.

In this article we describe the irreducible components of the scheme of
morphisms of class $\alpha$ from a rational curve to X.
  The irreducible components are described in the following way : the class
$\alpha$ can be seen as an element of $Pic(X)^*$ the dual of the Picard group.
Because any Weil-divisor need not to be a Cartier-divisor, there is (only) a
surjective map $s:A^1(X)^*\to Pic(X)^*$ from the dual of the group of
codimension 1 cycles to the dual of the Picard group. The irreducible
components are given by the effective elements $\beta$ in $A^1(X)^*$ such that
$s(\beta)=\alpha$.
  The proof of the result uses the Bott-Samelson resolution Y of X. We prove
that any curve on X can be lifted in Y (after deformation). This is because any
divisor on minuscule Schubert variety is a moving one. Then we prove that any
curve coming from X can be deformed so that it does not meet the contracted
divisor of $Y\to X$. This is possible because for minuscule Schubert variety
there are lines in the projectivised tangent space to a singularity. It is now
sufficient to deal with the case of the orbit of $Stab(X)$ the stabiliser of X

Typically, these solutions exhibit a critical phenomenon: If the capital
constraint is below some critical value, then the solution will coincide with a
classical solution; above this critical value, the solution is a superposition
of a classical solution and a less risky or even risk-free investment. For

``attainable'' attractor at which growth is expected, then growth and
convergence toward this attractor occurs with positive probability. Second, the

temperature and vorticity, it is found that the active scalar behavior is akin
to that of its co-evolving passive counterpart. The two other cases indicate
that this similarity is in fact not generic and differences between passive and

magnetic potential performs an inverse cascade while the passive scalar
cascades toward the small-scales; in surface flows, albeit both perform a
direct cascade, the potential temperature and the passive scalar have different
scaling laws already at the level of low-order statistical objects. These
dramatic differences are rooted in the correlations between the active scalar

nonconvex ``dimpled'' pulses and double pulses. We map out the pulse shapes and
maximum firing rates for different connection weights and gain functions.

  Stability","31 pages, 16 figures, submitted to SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical
  Systems",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM",,"  We analyze the stability of standing pulse solutions of a neural network
integro-differential equation. The network consists of a coarse-grained layer
of neurons synaptically connected by lateral inhibition with a non-saturating
nonlinear gain function. When two standing single-pulse solutions coexist, the
small pulse is unstable, and the large pulse is stable. The large single-pulse
is bistable with the ``all-off'' state. This bistable localized activity may
have strong implications for the mechanism underlying working memory. We show
that dimple pulses have similar stability properties to large pulses but double
pulses are unstable.

high-dimensional bipartite systems. These correlations are quantified by
parameters that are subject to the ""concentration of measure"" phenomenon,
meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their
expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive
consequence that there exist large subspaces in which all pure states are close
to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states
with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but
with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negligible
distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a
very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can
jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible
compared to the size of total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic.
Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to
speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified
when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our
results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal
superdense coding of quantum states.

based on quantum communication theory. It is applicable to direct encryption,
for example quantum stream cipher based on Yuen protocol(Y-00), with high
speeds and for long distance by sophisticated optical devices which can work
under the average photon number per signal light pulse:$<n> = 1000 \sim 10000$.
In addition, it may provide information-theoretic security against known/chosen
plaintext attack, which has no classical analogue. That is, one can provide
secure communication, even the system has $H(K) << H(X)$.
  In this paper, first, we give a brief review on the general logic of Yuen's
theory. Then, we show concrete security analysis of quantum stream cipher to
quantum individual measurement attacks. Especially by showing the analysis of
Lo-Ko known plaintext attack, the feature of Y-00 is clarified. In addition, we
give a simple experimental result on the advantage distillation by scheme
consisting of intensity modulation/direct detection optical communication.

$n$-bit message to Bob using a classical key, and where only one-way
transmission from Alice to Bob is possible. In this case, quantum communication
cannot help to obtain perfect secrecy with key length smaller then $n$. We
study the question of whether there might still be fundamental differences
between the case where quantum as opposed to classical communication is used.
In this direction, we show that there exist ciphers with perfect security
producing quantum ciphertext where, even if an adversary knows the plaintext
and applies an optimal measurement on the ciphertext, his Shannon uncertainty
about the key used is almost maximal. This is in contrast to the classical case
where the adversary always learns $n$ bits of information on the key in a known
plaintext attack. We also show that there is a limit to how different the
classical and quantum cases can be: the most probable key, given matching
plain- and ciphertexts, has the same probability in both the quantum and the
classical cases. We suggest an application of our results in the case where
only a short secret key is available and the message is much longer.
