to a high-mass black hole which spins rapidly if the binary is compact.
GRB030329/SN2003dh demonstrates that Type Ib/c supernovae are the parent
population of long GRBs, whose branching ratio is ${\cal R}=(2-4)\times
10^{-3}$. We identify ${\cal R}$ with the low probability of centered
nucleation in compact binaries. Decentered events are predicted to produce a
single short burst in gravitational radiation. Centered events are predicted to
produce a second, long-burst in gravitational radiation powered by a luminous
black hole. These signatures are of interest to LIGO, VIRGO and TAMA.

emission produce via inverse Compton scattering 10-50 TeV radiation which has
recently been observed with the HEGRA system of ground based gamma-ray

by INTEGRAL and ground based gamma-ray telescopes. Despite the lack of
sufficient spatial resolution in both bands to resolve the emission region,
correlation of the flux measurements in the two energy bands would allow to
constrain the structure of the emission region. The emission region is expected

397 (G41.1-0.3) obtained with ACIS-S. Previous studies of this SNR have shown
that it harbors a central X-ray `hot spot' suggestive of a compact object
associated with 3C 397. With the Chandra data, we can rule out the nature of
the hot spot as a pulsar or a pulsar wind nebula, and put an upper limit on the
flux of a hidden compact object of F (0.5--10 keV)~6E-13 erg/cm2/s. We found
two point sources in the Chandra field. We argue that none of them is
associated with 3C 397; and that the hard source, CXO J190741.2+070650, is a
newly discovered AGN. The Chandra image reveals arcseconds-scale clumps and
knots which are strongly correlated with the radio VLA image, except for the
X-ray hot spot. Our Chandra spatially resolved spectroscopic study shows that
one-component models are inadequate, and that at least two non-equilibrium
ionization thermal components are needed to fit the spectra of each selected
region. The derived average spectral parameters are consistent with the
previous global ASCA fits performed by Safi-Harb et al. (2000). However, the
hard component requires a high abundance of Fe indicating the presence of hot
Fe ejecta. When comparing the eastern with the western lobe, we find that the
column density, the brightness, and the ionization timescales are generally
higher for the western side. This result, combined with our study of the 3C397
environs at millimeter wavelengths, indicate a denser medium to the west of the
SNR. Our multi-wavelength imaging and spectral study favors the scenario where
3C 397 is a ~5,300-year old SNR expanding in a medium with a marked density
gradient, and which is likely to be encountering a molecular cloud on the
western side. We propose that 3C 397 will evolve into a mixed-morphology SNR.

density of photons originally emitted by the accretion disk and reflected off
the broad line region clouds dominates over that of photons of other origin. We

for both blackbody radiation and thermal bremsstrahlung in optically-thick and
-thin cases, respectively. Thus this allows us to investigate the structures of

transition regions from optically thick to optically thin. We show that there
is a maximum transition radius, roughly $R_{\rm tr, max}/R_g\sim 50$ when

passes the density region corresponding to resonant neutrino oscillations with

neutrino signal from a future galactic supernova. In addition to the shock wave
propagation effects that were previously studied, a reverse shock forms when
the supersonically expanding neutrino-driven wind collides with the slower
earlier supernova ejecta. This implies that for some period the neutrinos pass
two subsequent density discontinuities, giving rise to a ``double dip'' feature

analytically and numerically and find that it allows one to trace the positions
of the forward and reverse shocks. We show that the energy dependent neutrino
conversion probabilities allow one to detect oscillations even if the energy

differ. These features are observable in the \bar\nu_e signal for an inverted

of the [OIII] 4363 line. The oxygen abundances in three HII regions of Sextans
A are all consistent within the individual rms uncertainties. The oxygen
abundance in the PN of Sextans A is however significantly higher. This PN is
even more enriched in nitrogen and helium, implying its classification as a PN
of Type I. The presumably unaffected PN abundances of S and Ar are well below
those in the HII regions, indicating a lower metallicity at the epoch of the PN
progenitor formation. For two HII regions in Sextans B, the oxygen abundances
do not differ within the rms uncertainties. The third one is, however, twice as
metal-rich, providing evidence for the inhomogeneity of the current metallicity
distribution in Sextans B. For the PN in Sextans B we measured an O/H that is
consistent with that of the low-metallicity HII regions. For NGC 3109 our
preliminary results indicate that the oxygen abundances of PNe and HII regions
are all within a small range of $\pm$0.15 dex. For the PN in Fornax, Ne, Ar and

sources concur to X-ray emission, X-ray binaries and hot plasma being the most
important.

forming galaxies. In the second chapter we explore the quantitative
relationships between the total X-ray, radio and infrared luminosities for a
sample of 23 star forming galaxies. It is found that linear correlations hold
between the luminosities in the above bands. In the third chapter we show, by
analyzing a sample of 11 high redshift galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field, that
the linear correlations may be extended up to z~1. In the fourth chapter we
turn to an analysis of the luminosity function and number counts of star
forming galaxies; we show that the number density of normal galaxies at faint
X-ray fluxes (10^-17 -- 10^-15 erg/s/cm2) is very well defined. The fifth
chapter offers a first insight into a different aspect of galaxy evolution,
i.e. whether is it possible to determine the metallicity enhancements in a
starburst episode. An interesting, yet problematic, picture of metal enrichment
of the interstellar matter arises from an analysis of the X-ray and near

mass requires a filling factor as small as 10^{-2} on day 254, indicating a

light curve shows a change of slope at late phases, with an e-folding time of
60 +/-2 d in the [50:200] d time interval, considerably faster than the one of
{56}Co decay (i.e. 111.3 d), suggesting the gamma-rays escape with lower
deposition, owing to the low mass nature of the ejecta. After day 200, an
$e$-folding time ~47 +/-2.8 d is measured. A simplified gamma-ray deposition
model is applied after adding a contribution of about 35% to the computed
pseudo-bolometric light curves to account for near-IR luminosities to estimate
the ejecta and {56}Ni masses (M({56}Ni)=0.11 M_solar and M_{ej}=3.7 M_solar).
The deficit in luminosity is estimated to be about 50% around day 308. The
observed spectral blueshift combined with the dramatic and sudden drop in the

consequence of dust condensation in the ejecta of SN 1990I around day 250.

matrix) and vibrational entropy. On the basis of this evidence, the boson peak
must be a crossover from such a balance at higher frequencies to a mixture of
sound waves and additional excitations at low frequency.

many years ago by Arovas, Schrieffer, and Wilczek. The quasiparticles are in
general more complicated, described accurately in terms of excited composite

compute the Berry phase for a single composite-fermion quasiparticle, and find
that it agrees with the effective magnetic field concept for composite

in the Berry phase for a closed loop caused by the insertion of another
composite-fermion quasiparticle in the interior. Our results support the
general validity of fractional statistics in the quantum Hall superfluid, while
also giving a quantitative account of corrections to it when the quasiparticle

temperature T$_C$ was determined by monitoring the superlattice peaks

on both SrTiO$_3$ film thickness and SrRuO$_3$ buffer layer thickness. However,
lattice parameter measurements showed no sign of the phase transitions,
indicating that the tetragonality of the SrTiO$_3$ unit cells was no longer a
good order parameter. This signals a change in the nature of this phase
transition, the internal degree of freedom is decoupled from the external
degree of freedom. The phase transitions occur even without lattice relaxation
through domain formation. In NdNiO$_3$ thin films, it is found that the
in-plane lattice parameters were clamped by the substrate, while out-of-plane
lattice constant varied to accommodate the volume change across the phase
transition. This shows that substrate constraint is an important parameter for
epitaxial film systems, and is responsible for the suppression of external
structural change in SrTiO$_3$ and NdNiO$_3$ films. However, in SrRuO$_3$ films
we observed domain formation at elevated temperature through x-ray reciprocal

singlet one. The spin-flip processes induce the spin triplet pairing components
with s-wave in momentum and odd symmetry in frequency from the s-wave singlet
order parameter $\Delta$ of the superconductor region. The induced triplet
components alter the singlet order parameter in the superconductor through
boundary conditions at the interface and, consequently, change the $T_C$ of an

from first principles in real space. The localized magnetic moments also
interact with each other through a Heisenberg exchange potential. To take into
account correlation effects, a second quantized formulation is used. The
semi-classical limit is taken by using a coherent-state path-integral technique
which also allows us to go beyond a linear-response approach. We derive a set
of coupled equations of motion for the nonuniform magnetization, the spin
current and the two-point correlation functions of the magnetization. The rate
of change of the magnetization is shown to obey a generalized Landau-Lifshitz
equation that takes into account interaction with the conduction electrons.

the conduction electrons obeys a diffusion equation. The diffusion tensor,
which has off-diagonal terms due to the sd exchange interaction, is now

condensation of the svivon field, and the speed of their dynamics is determined
by the width of the double-svivon neutron-resonance peak. The connection of
this peak to the peak-dip-hump gap structure observed below Tc emerges
naturally. Pairing results from transitions between pair states of stripons and
quasi-electrons through the exchange of svivons. The pairing symmetry is of the
d_{x^2-y^2} type; however, sign reversal through the charged stripes results in
features not characteristic of this symmetry. The phase diagram is determined
by pairing and coherence lines within the regime of a Mott transition.
Coherence without pairing results in a Fermi-liquid state, and incoherent
pairing results in the pseudogap state where localized electron and electron
pair states exist within the Hubbard gap. A metal-insulator-transition quantum
critical point occurs between these two states at T=0 when the superconducting
state is suppressed. An intrinsic heterogeneity is expected of superconducting

studies of learning in real-time search (and reinforcement learning) assume
that a simple value-function-greedy policy is used to select actions. This is
in contrast to practice, where high-performance is usually attained by
interleaving planning and acting via a lookahead search of a non-trivial depth.

astronomical observations and the quantum field theory concerning the
zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum. The (negative) cosmological constant is
equal to the inverse of the Planck length squared, which means that in the toy
model the vanishing of the observed value of the cosmological constant is a
consequence of the existence of an energy cutoff exactly at the level of the
Planck scale. In turn, a model for both a virtual and a real
particle-antiparticle pair is proposed which describes properly some energetic
properties of both the vacuum fluctuations and created particles, as well as it
allows one to calculate the discrete ""bare"" values of an elementary-particle
mass, electric charge and intrinsic angular momentum (spin) at the energy
cutoff. The relationships between the discussed model and some phenomena such
as the Zitterbewegung and the Unruh-Davies effect are briefly analyzed, too.
The proposed model also allows one to derive the Lorentz transformation and the
Maxwell equations while considering the properties of the vacuum filled with
the sea of virtual particles and their antiparticles. Finally, the existence of
a finite value of the vacuum-energy density resulting from the toy model leads
us to the formulation of dimensionless Einstein field equations which can be
derived from the Lagrangian with a dimensionless (naively renormalized)

strong randomness, which leads to rapid reduction of the off-diagonal gluon

of the off-diagonal gluon as $M_{\rm off} \simeq 1 {\rm GeV}$ in the

infrared inactiveness of off-diagonal gluons, infrared QCD is well abelianized

inter-monopole potential and the dual gluon field $B_\mu$ in the MA gauge, and
find longitudinal magnetic screening with $m_B \simeq$ 0.5 GeV in the infrared

gluonic mode in QCD can be extracted by the projection along the
color-direction $\vec \phi(x)$ like the NAH theory. This projection is

projection. Since $\vec \phi(x)$ obeys the adjoint gauge transformation and is
diagonalized in the MA gauge, $\vec \phi(x)$ behaves as the Higgs scalar in the
NAH theory, and its hedgehog singularity provides the magnetic monopole in the

monopole appearing in the MA gauge and the hedgehog singularity of $\vec

the energy density is negative and the field is strongly unstable in a part of

does not expand during subsequent real-time evolution. In the outer part,
positive energy outgoing waves develop, which eventually form shocks. Behind
the outgoing waves and away from the bubble center, the background settles down

However, in the noncommutative version of the model the UV/IR mechanism gives
rise to infrared divergences which may spoil the perturbative expansion. In
this work we pursue the study of the consistency of the ${\cal N} = 1, 2, 4$

We employ the covariant superfield framework to compute the one-loop
corrections to the two- and three-point functions of the gauge superfield $V$.
It is found that the cancellation of the harmful UV/IR infrared divergences
only takes place in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. We argue
that this is in agreement with the low energy limit of the open superstring in
the presence of an external magnetic field. As expected, the planar sector of
the two-point function of the $V$ superfield exhibits UV divergences. They are
found to cancel, in the Feynman gauge, for the maximally extended ${\cal N} =
4$ supersymmetric theory. This gives support to the belief that the ${\cal N} =

the partition function for fluctuating topologies. In the simplest case the

there is a class of properly embedded p-minimal surfaces of so called helicoid

p-minimal surfaces includes all the entire p-minimal graphs (except contact

notion of formally smooth (co)algebra inside monoidal categories can substitute
that of (co)separable (co)algebra in the study of splitting bialgebra
homomorphisms. This is performed investigating the relation between formal
smoothness and separability of certain functors and led to other results
related to Hopf algebra theory. Between them we prove that the existence of
$ad$-(co)invariant integrals for a Hopf algebra $H$ is equivalent to the
separability of some forgetful functors. In the finite dimensional case, this
is also equivalent to the separability of the Drinfeld Double $D(H)$ over $H$.
Hopf algebras which are formally smooth as (co)algebras are characterized. We
prove that given a bialgebra surjection $\pi :E\to H$ with nilpotent kernel
such that $H$ is a Hopf algebra which is formally smooth as a $K$-algebra, then
$\pi $ has a section which is a right $H$-colinear algebra homomorphism.
Moreover, if $H$ is also endowed with an $ad$-invariant integral, then this
section can be chosen to be $H$-bicolinear. We also deal with the dual case.

from a quasilinear first-order partial differential equation associated with a
combinatorial renormalization of the model and bases itself on elementary
conformal mapping arguments coupled with singularity analysis techniques.
Probabilistic consequences in the case of ``subtractive'' urns are new
representations for the probability distribution of the urn's composition at
any time n, structural information on the shape of moments of all orders,
estimates of the speed of convergence to the Gaussian limit and an explicit
determination of the associated large deviation function. In the general case,
analytic solutions involve Abelian integrals over the Fermat curve x^h+y^h=1.
Several urn models, including a classical one associated with balanced trees
(2-3 trees and fringe-balanced search trees) and related to a previous study of
Panholzer and Prodinger, as well as all urns of balance 1 or 2 and a sporadic
urn of balance 3, are shown to admit of explicit representations in terms of
Weierstra\ss elliptic functions: these elliptic models appear precisely to
correspond to regular tessellations of the Euclidean plane.

carrier flow and uncorrelation between velocities due to their finite size. A
phenomenological model yields an estimate of collision rates for particle pairs

that these quantum theories are inequivalent in the sense that the mean values

ambiguities in the ordering of operators but from the fact of having several

is also shown that the uncertainty relations between the fundamental

susceptibility for the probe beam is studied for two typical cases when the
strength of the coupling beam is much greater or less than that of the signal
field. An interesting level reciprocity relationship between these two cases is
found.

(QPTs) characterized by nonanalyticities in the energy and bipartite
entanglement. We derive a functional relation between the matrix elements of
two-particle reduced density matrices and the eigenvalues of general two-body
Hamiltonians of $d$-level systems. The ground state energy eigenvalue and its
derivatives, whose non-analyticity characterizes a QPT, are directly tied to
bipartite entanglement measures. We show that first-order QPTs are signalled by
density matrix elements themselves and second-order QPTs by the first
derivative of density matrix elements. Our general conclusions are illustrated
via several quantum spin models.
