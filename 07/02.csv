simulation. This simulation has been realized using the Tree+SPH code GADGET-2
for a LambdaCDM model. In our analysis, we consider only objects with T_ew >2
keV and adopt an approach that mimics observations, associating with each
measurement an error comparable with recent observations and providing best-fit
results via robust techniques. Within the clusters, baryons are distributed
among (i) a cold neutral phase, with a relative contribution that increases
from less than 1 to 3 per cent at higher redshift, (ii) stars which contribute
with about 20 per cent and (iii) the X-ray emitting plasma that contributes by
80 (76) per cent at z=0 (1) to the total baryonic budget. A depletion of the
cosmic baryon fraction of ~7 (at z=0) and 5 (at z=1) per cent is measured at
the virial radius, R_vir, in good agreement with adiabatic hydrodynamical
simulations. We confirm that, also at redshift >0.5, power-law relations hold
between gas temperature, T, bolometric luminosity, L, central entropy, S, gas
mass, M_gas, and total gravitating mass, M_tot and that these relations are
steeper than predicted by simple gravitational collapse. A significant,
negative evolution in the L-T and L-M_tot relations and positive evolution in
the S-T relation are detected at 0.5 < z < 1 in this set of simulated galaxy
clusters. This is partially consistent with recent analyses of the observed
properties of z>0.5 X-ray galaxy clusters. By fixing the slope to the values
predicted by simple gravitational collapse, we measure at high redshift
normalizations lower by 10-40 per cent in the L-T, M_tot-T, M_gas-T, f_gas-T
and L-M_tot relations than the observed estimates.

We next grouped the observations in several different ways and computed the
average power-density spectra (PDS) in a search for further evidence of HFQPOs.
This effort yielded two significant results for those observations defined by
the presence of low-frequency QPOs (0.1-20 Hz) and an absence of
``band-limited'' power continua: (1) The 9 time intervals with the highest 7-35
keV count rates yielded an average PDS with a QPO at $166 \pm 5$ Hz. ($4.1

7--35 keV). The ratio of these two frequencies is $1.46 \pm 0.05$. This finding
is consistent with results obtained for three other black hole systems that
exhibit commensurate HFQPOs in a 3:2 ratio. Furthermore, the occurrence of

thermal X-rays. It has an obvious radio shell, but no discernable X-ray shell.
X-ray bright knots dot W44's image. The Chandra data show that the remnant's
hot, bright projected center is metal-rich and that the bright knots are
regions of comparatively elevated elemental abundances. The neon abundance is
elevated, suggesting that the center is rich in ejecta. Furthermore, some of
the emitting iron atoms appear to be underionized with respect to the other
ions, providing the first X-ray evidence for dust destruction in a supernova
remnant. We use the Chandra data to test the following explanations for W44's
X-ray bright center: 1.) entropy mixing from thermal conduction or bulk mixing,
2.) cloud evaporation, and 3.) a metallicity gradient, possibly due to dust
destruction and ejecta enrichment. In these tests, we assume that the remnant
has evolved beyond the adiabatic evolutionary stage, which explains the X-ray
dimness of the shell. The entropy mixed model spectrum was found to be a good
match to the Chandra spectrum. The bright knots have similar levels of
ionization as the surrounding regions, challenging the evaporating clouds
model. While both of these models are known to predict centrally bright X-ray
morphologies, their predictions fall short of the observed brightness gradient.
The resulting brightness gap can be largely filled in by emission from the
extra metals in and near the remnant's projected center. The preponderance of
evidence suggests that W44's remarkable morphology can be attributed to dust
destruction and ejecta enrichment within an entropy mixed, adiabatic phase
supernova remnant.

of the counterpart are consistent with a star with spectral type between O4V

instabilities (GIs), we have extended our 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of
protoplanetary disks from a previous paper. Our goal is to determine the
asymptotic behavior of GIs and how it is affected by different constant cooling
times. Initially, Rdisk = 40 AU, Mdisk = 0.07 Mo, M* = 0.5 Mo, and Qmin = 1.8.
Sustained cooling, with tcool = 2 orps (outer rotation periods, 1 orp ~ 250
yrs), drives the disk to instability in ~ 4 orps. This calculation is followed
for 23.5 orps. After 12 orps, the disk settles into a quasi-steady state with
sustained nonlinear instabilities, an average Q = 1.44 over the outer disk, a
well-defined power-law Sigma(r), and a roughly steady Mdot ~ 5(-7) Mo/yr. The
transport is driven by global low-order spiral modes. We restart the
calculation at 11.2 orps with tcool = 1 and 1/4 orp. The latter case is also
run at high azimuthal resolution. We find that shorter cooling times lead to
increased Mdots, denser and thinner spiral structures, and more violent dynamic
behavior. The asymptotic total internal energy and the azimuthally averaged
Q(r) are insensitive to tcool. Fragmentation occurs only in the high-resolution
tcool = 1/4 orp case; however, none of the fragments survive for even a quarter
of an orbit. Ring-like density enhancements appear and grow near the boundary
between GI active and inactive regions. We discuss the possible implications of
these rings for gas giant planet formation.

uniform over the stellar surface. Here account is taken of the fact that as
stellar spin rate S_o (=\sqrt {\Omega_o^2 R^3/GM}) is increased, and the
stellar equator is gravity darkened, the equatorial mass flux and terminal
speed are reduced, compared to the poles, for a given total \mdot. As a result,
the distribution of equatorial disk density, determined by the impact of north
and southbound flows, is shifted further out from the star. This results, for
high S_o (\gtrsim 0.5), in a fall in the disk mass and emission measure, and
hence in the observed emission line EW, scattering polarization, and IR
emission. Consequently, contrary to expectations, critical rotation S_o \to 1
is not the optimum for creation of hot star disks which, in terms of EM for
example, is found to occur in a broad peak around S_o\approx 0.5-0.6 depending
slightly on the wind velocity law.
  The relationship of this analytic quasi-steady parametric MTD model to other
work on magnetically guided winds is discussed. In particular the failures of
the MTD model for Be-star disks alleged by \citet{owo03} are shown to revolve
largely around open observational tests, rather in the basic MTD physics, and
around their use of insufficiently strong fields.

that the heating is due to an active galactic nucleus (AGN), i.e. a central
black hole accreting mass and launching jets and/or winds. We propose that the
feedback occurs with the entire cool inner region (r <~ 5-30 kpc), where the
non-linear over-dense blobs of gas with a density contrast >~2 cool fast and
are removed from the ICM before experiencing the next major AGN heating event.
We term this scenario ""cold-feedback"". Some of these blobs cool and sink toward
the central black hole, while others might form stars and cold molecular
clouds. We derive the conditions under which the dense blobs formed by
perturbations might cool to low temperatures (T <~ 10^4 K), and feed the black
hole. The main conditions are found to be: (1) An over-dense blob must be
prevented from reaching an equilibrium position in the ICM: therefore it has to
cool fast, and the density profile of the ambient gas should be shallow; (2)
Non-linear perturbations are required: they might have chiefly formed by
previous AGN activity; (3) The cooling time of these non-linear perturbations
should be short relative to few times the typical interval between successive
AGN outbursts. (4) The blobs should be magnetically disconnected from their
surroundings, in order not to be evaporated by thermal conduction.

Comparison with an earlier XMM-Newton observation when 1H 0419-577 was `X-ray

law or cool Comptonised thermal emission. Four further XMM-Newton observations,

while we also find the variable emission component in intermediate state
difference spectra to be strongly modified by absorption in low ionisation

of the underlying continuum while the `core' soft emission can be attributed to
recombination in an extended region of more highly ionised gas. We note the
wider implications of finding substantial cold dense matter overlying (or

may provide important clues for identifying the nature of the nascent compact
object. Given the estimates of the progenitor mass, the potential power source
is probably a pulsar rather than an accreting black hole. If there is a pulsar,
one would expect the rotational luminosity to be stored and reprocessed by the
supernova remnant, but no pulsar nebula has yet been seen. The lack of
detection of an X-ray synchrotron nebula should be taken as strong evidence
against the presence of a bright pulsar. This is because absorption by the
surrounding supernova gas should be negligible for the light of the companion
star to have been detected. A model is developed here for the luminosity of the
pulsar nebula in SN 1993J, which is then used to predict the spin-down power of
the putative pulsar. If one exists, it can be providing no more than about 6 x
10^{39} erg/s. With an initial rotation period of 10-30 ms, as extrapolated
from young galactic pulsars, the nascent neutron star can have either a weak
magnetic field, B < 10^{11} G, or one so strong, B > 10^{15} G, that its spin
was rapidly slowed down. The companion star, if bound to the neutron star,

high-energy gamma-rays. The expected non-pulsed, GeV signal is calculated; it

feedback in galaxy formation, explode within the very dense star-forming

of type II SNe in injecting energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) and in
re-heating a fraction of the original star-forming cloud is estimated with the
aid of a two-phase model for the ISM of the cloud. We argue that when SNe
explode the star-forming cloud has already been partially destroyed by ionizing
light and winds from massive stars. SN remnants (SNRs) will first cause the
collapse of most of the cloud gas into cold fragments, until the diffuse hot
phase has a low enough density to make further radiative losses negligible.
This is completed in ~3 Myr, with a modest energy loss of ~5 per cent of the
total budget. We compute that a fraction ranging from 5 to 30 per cent of the
cloud is reheated to a high temperature (from 10^5 to 10^7 K); these numbers
are very uncertain, due to the very complicated nature of the problem, and to
the uncertain role of thermal evaporation. Small star-forming clouds, less
massive than ~10^4 Msun, will be destroyed by a single SN. In all cases, a high
fraction of the energy from type II SNe (~80 per cent for large clouds, smaller
but still significant for small clouds) will be available for heating the ISM.

phase with well defined octahedral and pyramidal sublattices. Treatment of
neutron diffraction patterns of the sample I itself gives a sophisticated spin
structure. Knowing the structure of sample II, one can chose only proper
magnetic lines, which give exactly the same results as for sample II. Above the
Neel temperature TN ~ 290K, there is a structural transition to the phase 2ap x

in the $c$ direction only, we find a broad maximum in the c-axis resistivity at
a temperature near the characteristic energy of the bosonic mode, while no
corresponding feature appears in the $ab$ plane transport. At temperatures far
from this bosonic energy scale, the c-axis resistivity does track the in-plane
electron scattering rate. We demonstrate a reasonable fit of our theory to the
apparent metallic to non-metallic crossover in the c-axis resistivity of the
layered ruthenate $\rm Sr_2 Ru O_4$.

This result mimics a similar general relativistic result: static
Einstein-Straus universes do not exist.

d=5 dimensions, such corrections arise only in the presence of a vacuum
expectation value of the adjoint scalar of the gauge multiplet. We show that,
using the analysis of the exact quantum effective action by Intriligator,
Morrison and Seiberg, these power corrections can be understood as the effect
of higher-dimension operators. Such operators, both classical and quantum, are
highly constrained by gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. As a result, even
non-perturbatively large contributions to gauge coupling unification can be
unambiguously determined within 5d low-energy effective field theory. Since no
massive hypermultiplet matter exists in 6 dimensions, the predictivity is
further enhanced by embedding the 5d model in a 6d gauge theory relevant at
smaller distances. Thus, large and quantitatively controlled power-law
contributions to gauge couplings arise naturally and can, in the most extreme
case, lead to calculable TeV-scale power law unification. We identify a simple
5d SU(5) model with one massless 10 in the bulk where the power-law effect is
exactly MSSM-like.

the local or global onset of chaos. Despite numerous previous investigations

based on different approaches, several aspects of the phenomenon still escape a
complete understanding and a rigorous description. In particular Greene's
approach is based on several conjectures, one of which is that the stochastic
transition leading to the destruction of the last KAM curve in the standard map
is due the linear destabilization of the elliptic points belonging to a
peculiar family of invariants sets {I(m,n)}
  (rational iterates) having rational winding numbers and associated to the
last KAM curve. Purpose of this work is to analyze the nonlinear phenomena
leading to the stochastic transition in the standard map and their effect on
the destabilization of the invariant sets associated to the KAM curves,
leading, ultimately, to the destruction of the KAM curves themselves.

Dedekind order completion of suitable spaces of piece-wise smooth functions on
the Euclidean domains of definition of the respective PDEs. The method can also
deal with associated initial and/or boundary value problems. The solutions
obtained can be assimilated with usual measurable functions or even with
Hausdorff continuous functions on the respective Euclidean domains. It is
important to note that the use of the order completion method does not require
any monotonicity condition on the nonlinear systems of PDEs involved. One of
the major advantages of the order completion method is that it eliminates the
algebra based dichotomy ""linear versus nonlinear"" PDEs, treating both cases
with equal ease. Furthermore, the order completion method does not introduce
the dichotomy ""monotonous versus non-monotonous"" PDEs. None of the known
functional analytic methods can exhibit such a performance, since in addition
to topology, such methods are significantly based on algebra.

pair annihilation contributions which are subtle to handle in light-front

phenomenological parametrization for the proton's generalized parton
distributions. This task is non-trivial due to the field theoretic constraints
required of these distributions. To meet the constraints imposed by Lorentz
covariance, we approach generalized parton distributions from the perspective
of double distributions. Despite avid phenomenological use, surprisingly little
work has been done to calculate double distributions. We first focus on a
number of simple pedagogical examples and demonstrate how double distributions
can be correctly determined. The double distributions we derive, including
those for the proton, satisfy known constraints and are adequate for
phenomenological estimates of cross sections. The models used allow one to
study the interplay between the light-front formulation and Lorentz covariance.

However, the effect can be enhanced significantly if one works with a
near-critical phase-separated liquid mixture, whereby the surface tension
becomes weak. The bending may in this way become as large as several tenths of
micrometers, even with the use of only moderate laser power. This
near-criticality is a key element in our experimental investigations as
reviewed in the article. The effect is achieved by working with a micellar
phase of microemulsions, at room temperature. We give a brief survey of the

mediates the collective response of a neural lattice (classical brain). The
model is used to explain eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a
Recurrent Quantum Neural Network(RQNN) while simulating the quantum brain
model, two very interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data
is processed in a classical brain, a wave packet is triggered in the quantum
brain. This wave packet moves like a particle. Second, when the eye tracks a
fixed target, this wave packet moves not in a continuous but rather in a
discrete mode. This result reminds one of the saccadic movements of the eye
consisting of 'jumps' and 'rests'. However, such a saccadic movement is
intertwined with smooth pursuit movements when the eye has to track a dynamic
trajectory. In a sense, this is the first theoretical model explaining the
experimental observation reported concerning eye movements in a static scene
situation. The resulting prediction is found to be very precise and efficient
in comparison to classical objective modeling schemes such as the Kalman

time-dependent symmetric double-well potential using analytical and numerical
methods. The effects of internal degrees of freedom on the visibility of
interference fringes during a stage of ballistic expansion are investigated
varying particle number, nonlinear interaction sign and strength as well as
tunneling coupling. Expressions for the phase resolution are derived and the
possible enhancement due to squeezing is discussed. In particular, the role of
the superfluid - Mott insulator cross-over and its analog for attractive
interactions is recognized.

measurement. When it is used in quantum teleportation the information about an
unknown input state is optimally distributed among three outgoing qubits. The
optimality means that the output fidelities saturate the asymmetric cloning
inequality. The flow of information among the qubits is controlled by the
preparation of a pair of ancillary qubits used in the Bell measurement. It is
also demonstrated that the measurement is optimal two-qubit operation in the
sense of the trade-off between the state disturbance and the information gain.

correlations between local measurements carried out on these states cannot
always be reproduced by local hidden variable models. Svetlichny, followed by
others, showed that multipartite quantum states are even more nonlocal than
bipartite ones in the sense that nonlocal classical models with (super-luminal)
communication between some of the parties cannot reproduce the quantum
correlations. Here we study in detail the kinds of nonlocality present in
quantum states. More precisely we enquire what kinds of classical communication
patterns cannot reproduce quantum correlations. By studying the extremal points
of the space of all multiparty probability distributions, in which all parties
can make one of a pair of measurements each with two possible outcomes, we find
a necessary condition for classical nonlocal models to reproduce the statistics
of all quantum states. This condition extends and generalises work of
Svetlichny and others in which it was shown that a particular class of
classical nonlocal models, the ``separable'' models, cannot reproduce the
statistics of all multiparticle quantum states. Our condition shows that the
nonlocality present in some entangled multiparticle quantum states is much
stronger than previously thought. We also study the sufficiency of our
condition.

electrons. When this ratio becomes greater then 1, the Coulomb interaction does
not practically influence the scattering.
