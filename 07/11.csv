main difference between the single node geometry and a regular lattice is that
in the latter case, the single particle spectrum is organized into periodic
energy bands, so that the renormalization procedure has to stop when the last
totally occupied band has been eliminated. We therefore predict a strongly
renormalized Luttinger liquid behavior for generic filling factors, which

Standard Supersymmetric Model involving neutrinos and quarks (``flavor changing
neutral currents'', FCNC's) in the infall stage of stellar collapse. Our
considerations extend to other kinds of flavor changing neutrino reactions as
well. We examine non-forward neutrino scattering processes on heavy nuclei and
free nucleons in the supernova core. This investigation has led to four
principal original discoveries/products: (1) first calculation of neutrino
flavor changing cross sections for spin one half (e.g. free nucleon) and spin
zero nuclear targets; (2) discovery of nuclear mass number squared (A squared)
coherent amplification of neutrino-quark FCNC's; (3) analysis of FCNC-induced
alteration of electron capture and weak/nuclear equilibrium in the collapsing
core; and (4) generalization of the calculated cross sections (mentioned in 1)
for the case of hot heavy nuclei to be used in collapse/supernova and neutrino
transport simulations. The scattering processes that we consider allow electron
neutrinos to change flavor during core collapse, thereby opening holes in the
electron neutrino sea, which allows electron capture to proceed and results in
a lower core electron fraction. A lower electron fraction implies a lower
homologous core mass, a lower shock energy, and a greater nuclear
photo-disintegration burden for the shock. In addition, unlike the standard
supernova model, the core now could have net muon and/or tau lepton numbers.
These effects could be significant even for supersymmetric couplings below
current experimental bounds.

rolling scalar field in this regime, and extend the analysis to cosmological
systems obtained by coupling this type of field theory to four dimensinal
gravity. It also leads to some FRW cosmologies, some of which are related to
those obtained with tachyon matter.

efficiently perform routing in a faulty network in which each link fails with
some probability. This paper investigates how big the failure probability can
be, before the capability to efficiently find a path in the network is lost.
Our main results show tight upper and lower bounds for the failure probability
which permits routing, both for the hypercube and for the $d-$dimensional mesh.
We use tools from percolation theory to show that in the $d-$dimensional mesh,
once a giant component appears -- efficient routing is possible. A different
behavior is observed when the hypercube is considered. In the hypercube there
is a range of failure probabilities in which short paths exist with high
probability, yet finding them must involve querying essentially the entire
network. Thus the routing complexity of the hypercube shows an asymptotic phase
transition. The critical probability with respect to routing complexity lies in
a different location then that of the critical probability with respect to
connectivity. Finally we show that an oracle access to links (as opposed to
local routing) may reduce significantly the complexity of the routing problem.
We demonstrate this fact by providing tight upper and lower bounds for the
complexity of routing in the random graph $G_{n,p}$.

that in case the net is either a Virasoro net or any at least 4-regular net
such an extension is unique: the local algebras together with the Moebius
symmetry (equivalently: the local algebras together with the vacuum vector)
completely determine it. We draw the two following conclusions for such
theories. (1) The value of the central charge c is an invariant and hence the
Virasoro nets for different values of c are not isomorphic as Moebius covariant
nets. (2) A vacuum preserving internal symmetry always commutes with the
diffeomorphism symmetries. We further use our result to give a large class of
new examples of nets (even strongly additive ones), which are not
diffeomorphism covariant; i.e. which do not admit an extension of the symmetry
to Diff^+(S^1).

reconnection. We demonstrate two main points. First, we show that, given
sufficiently small resistivity, the Rutherford regime always exists; larger
values of Delta' require smaller values of resistivity. Rutherford's
negligible-inertia assumption is validated and the asymptotically linear
dependence of the time derivative of the island width on the resistivity and
Delta' is confirmed. Second, we find that, at large Delta', the Rutherford
regime is followed by a nonlinear stage of fast growth linked to X-point
collapse and formation of a current sheet. This causes the reconnection to
become Sweet-Parke (SP) like. The signature resistivity^{1/2} scaling of the
effective island growth rate is, indeed, found in this nonlinear stage. The SP
stage culminates in the saturation of the mode, which can, thus, be achieved
much faster than via Rutherford regime.
