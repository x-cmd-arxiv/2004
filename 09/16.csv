at the end of the 2002 Austral winter and throughout the 2003 season were added
to the data from which the first detection of polarization of the cosmic

supports, with increased statistical power, all of the conclusions drawn from
the initial data set. In particular, the detection of E-mode polarization is
increased to 6.3 sigma confidence level, TE cross-polarization is detected at
2.9 sigma, and B-mode polarization is consistent with zero, with an upper limit
well below the level of the detected E-mode polarization. The results are in
excellent agreement with the predictions of the cosmological model that has
emerged from CMB temperature measurements. The analysis also demonstrates that
contamination of the data by known sources of foreground emission is
insignificant.

simulations of galaxy-galaxy lensing in the HDF-North show that proper
inclusion of multiple weak deflections is important for a correct prediction of
the net shear for most sources, and for a given source redshift the number of
multiple weak deflections is largely insensitive to the cosmography. The
effects of multiple weak deflections on the magnitude of the weak lensing
signal are, of course, strong functions of the adopted halo parameters.
Independent of the halo parameters, however, the closest lens to a source (in
projection on the sky) is not the strongest lens in the case of more than 50%
of the sources which acquire a net shear of \gamma < 0.01. In addition,
multiple weak deflections result in a tangential shear about the lens centers
that is greater than the tangential shear that would occur if source galaxies
were lensed solely by the closest lens. Further, multiple weak deflections give
rise to correlated image ellipticities and account for a substantial amount of
the total cosmic shear signal on small angular scales in Lambda-CDM and open
CDM models.

air showers (EAS) detected by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT)
used in the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. The method is based on
the discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) on compact Lie groups, and the use of
continuous extension of the inverse discrete transforms to approximate the
discrete EAS images by continuous EAS brightness distribution functions. Here
we describe the FT-method in case of SU(3) group. It allows practical
realization of the DFT technique for functions sampled on hexagonal symmetry
grids. The proposed method can also be implemented in case of IACT cameras with
grids of rectangular symmetry by using the DFT on the SU(2)xSU(2) group. The
proposed FT-method is applied to the Monte-Carlo simulated bank of TeV proton
and gamma-ray EAS images for a stand-alone telescope. Comparing between the
FT-method and the currently used standard method shows that the FT technique
allows a better and systematic enhancement of the gamma-ray signal. The
relative difference between these two methods becomes more profound especially
for `photon poor' images. It suggests that the EAS detection thresholds of
IACTs could be effectively reduced with the use of FT technique. This
prediction is further supported by a significant noise suppression capability
of the method using simple low-pass filters in the image frequency domain. The
FT-method allows very deep `tail' (and `height') image cuts, differentiation of
images, operations in the image frequency domain, etc., that can be used for
development of new effective parameters for the EAS image processing.

metallicity and gravity - and their effects are not well understood. In this
paper, based on a splinter session, we discuss classification schemes for L and
T dwarfs, their dependency on wavelength, and the effects of the parameters
T_eff, f_sed, [m/H] and log g on optical and infrared spectra. We will discuss
the various hypotheses that have been presented for the transition from the
dusty L types to the clear atmosphere T types. We conclude with a brief

SN 2003dh associated with GRB 030329, as well as the identification of SN-like
components to the afterglows of other GRBs, appears to have confirmed the
GRB/SN paradigm. However, the likely progenitors of Type Ic SNe are Wolf-Rayet
WC stars, and late-type WC stars have been observed to be surrounded by dust,
at a distance of 10^14 -- 10^15 cm from the star. Consequently, we revisit the
possibility of GRB dust echoes, not on a timescale of weeks after the burst but
on a timescale of minutes to hours. We find that if the optical flash is
sufficiently bright and the jet sufficiently wide, GRB afterglows may be
accompanied by chromatic variations on this timescale. From these signatures,
such model parameters as the inner radius of the dust distribution, the initial
opening angle of the jet, etc., may be deduced. With rapid and regular
localizations of GRBs by HETE-2, Integral, and now Swift, and new and improved
robotic telescope systems, these early-time GRB dust echoes may soon be
detected. We describe one such robotic telescope system, called PROMPT, that
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is building at the Cerro Tololo

Galaxies can be identified in 2MASS at optical extinction layers of over 10mag.
However, star density has been found to be the dominant limiting factor in the

  Systematic positional offsets have also been found between objects in the

their origin in the astrometric reference frame used by these surveys as well
as different fitting algorithms when determining positions (details are given

of 1 - 1.5 arcsec, comparable to the relative dispersion in positions between
these surveys. Still, it is advisable to take this effect into account when
combining galaxies from different catalogs for observational purposes.

significant differences between the power in the fluctuations for positive and
negative Galactic latitudes and between the four Galactic Quadrants. There are
also differences between the power spectrum at latitudes within 10 deg of the
Plane and at higher latitudes. The `slope' of the power spectrum has similar
variations.
  In an effort to find the origin of these Galactic-style effects we have
examined the evidence from Galactic gamma rays, specifically from the EGRET
instrument. A correlation is found between gamma ray intensities and the CMB
and other cosmic ray indicators.
  Most of the large scale Galactic asymmetries (eg north, south difference and
Quadrant variations) have analogues in cosmic ray asymmetries and also in some
other Galactic properties, such as the column density of gas. Thus, it is
possible to hypothesise on direct cosmic ray-induced contributions, although it
may be that cosmic rays are simply the indicators of Galactic `conditions'
which are influencing the residual CMB fluctuations.
  Irrespective of the actual cause of the correlations we have endeavoured to
extrapolate to the situation where the residual foreground is minimised. The
effect on the usually-derived cosmological properties - universal matter
content, ionization, the tensor contribution, tilt and curvature - is briefly
examined.

equation of state. Such disks are subject to the development of both the
magnetorotational and gravitational instabilities, which transport angular
momentum outward. As in previous studies, our hydrodynamical simulations show
the growth of strong m=2 spiral structure. This spiral disturbance drives
matter toward the central object and disappears when the Toomre parameter Q has
increased well above unity. When a weak magnetic field is present as well, the
magnetorotational instability grows and leads to turbulence. In that case, the
strength of the gravitational stress tensor is lowered by a factor of about~2
compared to the hydrodynamical run and oscillates periodically, reaching very
small values at its minimum. We attribute this behavior to the presence of a
second spiral mode with higher pattern speed than the one which dominates in
the hydrodynamical simulations. It is apparently excited by the high frequency
motions associated with MHD turbulence. The nonlinear coupling between these
two spiral modes gives rise to a stress tensor that oscillates with a frequency
which is a combination of the frequencies of each of the modes. This
interaction between MHD turbulence and gravitational instabilities therefore
results in a smaller mass accretion rate onto the central object.

self-decay as a consequence of the inflationary expansion through processes

inside the Hubble radius the decay is enhanced by the emission of ultrasoft
collinear quanta, i.e. bremsstrahlung radiation of superhorizon quanta which
becomes the leading decay channel for physical wavelengths

hard spheres, the outer brushes as spherical shells of continuously distributed
charge, the microions (counterions and salt ions) as point charges, and the
solvent as a dielectric continuum. The multi-component mixture of macroions and
microions is formally mapped onto an equivalent one-component suspension by
integrating out from the partition function the microion degrees of freedom.
Applying second-order perturbation theory and a random phase approximation,
analytical expressions are derived for the effective pair interaction and a
one-body volume energy, which is a natural by-product of the one-component
reduction. The combination of an inner core and an outer shell, respectively
impenetrable and penetrable to microions, allows the interactions between
macroions to be tuned by varying the core diameter and brush thickness. In the
limiting cases of vanishing core diameter and vanishing shell thickness, the

broad regimes: non-dissipative, dissipative but superconducting, and normal or
non-superconducting. These regimes are demarkated by two definitions of
critical current: one is the threshold current above which the superconductor
enters a dissipative (resistive) state; the other is the thermodynamic
threshold above which the superconductivity itself is destroyed and the
superconducting order parameter vanishes. The first threshold defines the
conventional critical current density Jc and the second defines the depairing
(or pair-breaking) current Jd. Type II superconductors in the mixed state have
quantized flux vortices, which tend to move when acted upon by the Lorentz
driving force of an applied transport current. In such a mixed state the
resistance vanishes only when vortices are pinned in place by defects and the
applied current is below the threshold Jc required to overcome pinning and
mobilize the vortices. Typically Jd >> Jc and a direct experimental measurement
of Jd over the entire temperature range (0 < T < Tc) is prohibited by the
enormous power dissipation densities (p ~ 10^10 -- 10^12 W/cm^3) needed to
reach the normal state. In this work, intense pulsed signals were used to
extend transport measurements to unprecedented power densities (p ~ 10^9 --
10^10 W/cm^3). This together with MgB2's combination of low normal-state
resistivity and high transition temperature have permitted a direct estimation
of \jd over the entire temperature range. This review describes our
experimental investigation of current-induced depairing in MgB2, and provides
an introduction to the phenomenological theories of superconductivity and how

based on the Grassmannian functional integral, which has been used in recent
years by many authors, with the traditional Wilsonian RG approach to quantum
systems pioneered by Hertz [Phys. Rev. B 14, 1165 (1976)], which attempts to
describe the infrared behavior of the system in terms of an effective bosonic
theory associated with the soft modes of the underlying fermionic problem. In
our approach, we decouple the interaction by means of a suitable
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation (following the Hertz-approach), but do not
eliminate the fermions; instead, we derive an exact hierarchy of RG flow
equations for the irreducible vertices of the resulting coupled field theory
involving both fermionic and bosonic fields. The freedom of choosing a momentum
transfer cutoff for the bosonic soft modes in addition to the usual band cutoff
for the fermions opens the possibility of new RG schemes. In particular, we
show how the exact solution of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model emerges from the
functional RG if one works with a momentum transfer cutoff. Then the Ward
identities associated with the local particle conservation at each Fermi point
are valid at every stage of the RG flow and provide a solution of an infinite
hierarchy of flow equations for the irreducible vertices. The RG flow equation
for the irreducible single-particle self-energy can then be closed and can be
reduced to a linear integro-differential equation, the solution of which yields
the result familiar from bosonization. We suggest new truncation schemes of the
exact hierarchy of flow equations, which might be useful even outside the weak
coupling regime.

processes that communicate only with nearest neighbors, global
desynchronization in operation times can be deduced from kinetic roughening of
the corresponding virtual-time horizon (VTH). The utilization of the parallel
processing environment can be deduced by analyzing the microscopic structure of
the VTH. We give an overview of how the methods of non-equilibrium surface
growth (physics of complex systems) can be applied to uncover some properties
of state update algorithms used in distributed parallel discrete-event
simulations (PDES). In particular, we focus on the asynchronous conservative
PDES algorithm in a ring communication topology. The time evolution of its VTH
is simulated numerically as asynchronous cellular automaton whose update rule
corresponds to the update rule followed by this algorithm. We give theoretical
estimates of the performance as a function of $L$ and the load per processor,
i.e., approximate formulas for the mean speedup and for the desynchronization.
It is established that, for a given simulation size, there is a theoretical
upper bound for the desynchronization and a theoretical non-zero lower bound
for the utilization. The new approach to performance studies, outlined in this
chapter, is particularly useful in the search for the design of a
new-generation of algorithms that would efficiently carry out an autonomous or
tunable synchronization.

every $a \in {\cal A}$ defines a random operator, and we study the dynamics of
such operators. In the noncommutative regime, there is no usual time but, on
the strength of the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, there exists a one-parameter group
of automorphisms of the algebra ${\cal A}$ which can be used to define a state
dependent dynamics; i.e., the pair $({\cal A}, \phi)$, where $\phi $ is a state
on ${\cal A}$, is a ``dynamic object''. Only if certain additional conditions
are satisfied, the Connes-Nikodym-Radon theorem can be applied and the
dependence on $\phi $ disappears. In these cases, the usual unitary quantum
mechanical evolution is recovered. We also notice that the same pair $({\cal
A}, \phi)$ defines the so-called free probability calculus, as developed by
Voiculescu and others, with the state $\phi $ playing the role of the
noncommutative probability measure. This shows that in the noncommutative
regime dynamics and probability are unified. This also explains probabilistic
properties of the usual quantum mechanics.

  On a phenomenological ground, such an {\it ultramassive} axion turns out to
be quite interesting. It can be produced during the gravitational collapse or
during the merging of two compact objects, and its subsequent decay into e+e-
provides an efficient mechanism for the transfer of the gravitational energy of
the collapsing system to the electron-positron plasma. This could resolve the
energy budget problem in the Gamma Ray Bursts and also help in understanding
the SN type II explosion phenomena.

dynamics of non-relativistic extended objects coupled to gravity. The formalism
is relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted
by binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for
gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a
clean separation of the three relevant scales: r_s, the size of the compact
objects, r the orbital radius and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation
(where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT radiation is
systematically included in the v expansion without need to separate integrals
into near zones and radiation zones. We show that the renormalization of
ultraviolet divergences which arise at v^6 in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations
requires the presence of two non-minimal worldline gravitational couplings
linear in the Ricci curvature. However, these operators can be removed by a
redefinition of the metric tensor, so that the divergences at arising at v^6
have no physically observable effect. Because in the EFT finite size features
are encoded in the coefficients of non-minimal couplings, this implies a simple
proof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least
order v^6. Neglecting absorptive effects, we find that the power counting rules
of the EFT indicate that the next set of short distance operators, which are
quadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations, do not
play a role until order v^10. These operators, which encapsulate finite size
properties of the sources, have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching
calculation. By including the most general set of such operators, the EFT
allows one to work within a point particle theory to arbitrary orders in v.

exist black holes with scalar hair that are specified by a single conserved

this provides an example of black hole non-uniqueness. We also show there exist
solutions where smooth initial data evolve to a big crunch singularity. This
opens up the possibility of using the dual conformal field theory to obtain a

The QHFTs are defined for a $(2+1)$-bordism category based on the set of
compact oriented 3-manifolds $Y$, equipped with properly embedded framed links
$L_\Ff$ and with flat connections $\rho$ of principal $PSL(2,\C)$-bundles over
$Y \setminus L_\Ff$, with arbitrary holonomy at the link meridians. A main
point is the introduction of new parameters for the space of all
$PSL(2,\C)$-characters of a punctured surface. Each QHFT associates to a triple
$(Y,L_\Ff,\rho)$ as above with parametrized boundary components a tensor, which
is generically holomorphic w.r.t. the parameters for the restriction of $\rho$
to $\partial Y \setminus L_\Ff$. This gives new numerical invariants of
3-manifolds, such as Chern-Simons invariants of $PSL(2,\mc)$-characters of
arbitrary link complements, or quantum invariants of compact hyperbolic cone
manifolds. Also, for any $PSL(2,\mc)$-character of a surface of finite

attain the endpoint by proving that the Lebesgue measure of the resulting

$\frac{d}{2}$. In three dimensions we are off by a logarithm.

isotropic turbulence with helicity is computed for the first time from a direct
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations in a 512^3 periodic domain.
This law is a statement of helicity conservation in the inertial range,
analogous to the benchmark Kolmogorov 4/5-law for energy conservation in
high-Reynolds number turbulence. The appropriately normalized parity-breaking
statistics, when measured in an arbitrary direction in the flow, disagree with
the theoretical value of 2/15 predicted for isotropic turbulence. They are
highly anisotropic and variable and remain so over a long times. We employ a
recently developed technique to average over many directions and so recover the
statistically isotropic component of the flow. The angle-averaged statistics
achieve the 2/15 factor to within about 7% instantaneously and about 5% on
average over time. The inertial- and viscous-range behavior of the
helicity-dependent statistics and consequently the helicity flux, which appear
in the 2/15-law, are shown to be more anisotropic and intermittent than the
cor- responding energy-dependent reflection-symmetric structure functions, and
the energy flux, which appear in the 4/5-law. This suggests that the Kolmogorov
assumption of local isotropy at high Reynolds numbers needs to be modified for
the helicity-dependent statistics investigated here.

described by the operators heavily concentrated in atomic cores, like to
hyperfine structure and P,T-parity nonconservation effects, usually require
accounting for relativistic effects. Unfortunately, completely relativistic
treatment of molecules containing heavy elements is very consuming already at
the stages of calculation and transformation of two-electron integrals with a
basis set of four-component spinors.
  In turn, the relativistic effective core potential (RECP) calculations of
valence (spectroscopic, chemical etc.) properties of molecules are very popular
because the RECP method allows one to treat quite satisfactory the correlation
and relativistic effects for the valence electrons of a molecule and to reduce
significantly the computational efforts. The valence molecular spinors are
usually smoothed in atomic cores and, as a result, direct calculation of
electronic densities near heavy nuclei is impossible.
  In the paper, the methods of nonvariational and variational one-center
restoration of correct shapes of four-component spinors in atomic cores after a
two-component RECP calculation of a molecule are discussed. Their efficiency is
illustrated in correlation calculations of hyperfine structure and parity

bioinformatic analysis to study a model of type 1 diabetes developing in
non-obese diabetic (NOD) male mice in which the disease was accelerated and
synchronized by exposing the mice to cyclophosphamide at 4 weeks of age. We
obtained sera from 19 individual mice, treated the mice to induce
cyclophosphamide-accelerated diabetes (CAD), and found, as expected, that 9
mice became severely diabetic while 10 mice permanently resisted diabetes. We
again obtained serum from each mouse afterCAD induction. We then analyzed the
patterns of antibodies in the individualmice to 266 different antigens spotted
on the antigen chip. We identified a select panel of 27 different antigens (10%
of the array) that revealed a pattern of IgG antibody reactivity in the pre-CAD
serathat discriminated between the mice resistant or susceptible to CAD with
100% sensitivity and 82% specificity (p=0.017). Surprisingly, the set of IgG
antibodies that was informative before CAD induction did not separate the
resistant and susceptible groups after the onset of CAD; new antigens became
criticalfor post-CAD repertoire discrimination. Thus, at least for a model
disease, present antibody repertoires can predict future disease; predictive
and diagnostic repertoires can differ; and decisive information about immune
system behavior can be mined by bioinformatic technology. Repertoires matter.

dynamics, with two complications. First, the increasing number of genotypes
that become available with increasing distance from the starting point implies
that fitness records are more frequent than for the standard case of
independent, identically distributed random variables. Second, fitness records
can be bypassed, which strongly reduces the number of genotypes that take part
in an evolutionary trajectory. For exponential and Gaussian fitness
distributions, this number scales with sequence length $N$ as $\sqrt{N}$, and
it is of order unity for distributions with a power law tail. This is in strong
contrast to the number of records, which is of order $N$ for any fitness
distribution.

(RMT). We determine the global regularity of the spectral fluctuations of the
instantaneous Hamiltonians encountered during the interpolation between the
starting Hamiltonians and the ones whose ground states encode the solutions to
the computational problems of interest. At each interpolation point, we
quantify the degree of regularity of the average spectral distribution via its
Brody parameter, a measure that distinguishes regular (i.e., Poissonian) from
chaotic (i.e., Wigner-type) distributions of normalized nearest-neighbor
spacings. We find that for hard problem instances, i.e., those having a
critical ratio of clauses to variables, the spectral fluctuations typically
become irregular across a contiguous region of the interpolation parameter,
while the spectrum is regular for easy instances. Within the hard region, RMT
may be applied to obtain a mathematical model of the probability of avoided
level crossings and concomitant failure rate of the adiabatic algorithm due to
non-adiabatic Landau-Zener type transitions. Our model predicts that if the
interpolation is performed at a uniform rate, the average failure rate of the
quantum adiabatic algorithm, when averaged over hard problem instances, scales
exponentially with increasing problem size.

condensates can spontaneously appear under the effect of measurements. We first
consider a system that is the juxtaposition of two subsystems in Fock states
with high populations, and assume that successive individual position
measurements are performed. Initially, the relative phase is totally undefined,
and no interference effect takes place in the first position measurement. But,
while successive measurements are accumulated, the relative phase becomes
better and better known, and a clear interference pattern emerges. It turns out
that all observed results can be interpreted in terms of a pre-existing, but
totally unknown, relative phase, which remains exactly constant during the
experiment. We then generalize the results to more condensates. We also
consider other initial quantum states than pure Fock states, and distinguish
between intrinsic phase of a quantum state and phase induced by measurements.
Finally, we examine the case of multiple condensates of spin states. We discuss
a curious quantum effect, where the measurement of the spin angular momentum of
a small number of particles can induce a big angular momentum in a much larger
assembly of particles, even at an arbitrary distance. This spin observable can
be macroscopic, assimilable to the pointer of a measurement apparatus, which
illustrates the non-locality of quantum mechanics with particular clarity.

  Beyond the Quantum Regression Theorem","Submitted (04 Jul 04)","Physical Review Letters 94, 200403 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.200403",,"quant-ph",,"  Multiple time correlation functions are found in the dynamical description of
different phenomena. They encode and describe the fluctuations of the dynamical
variables of a system. In this paper we formulate a theory of non-Markovian
multiple-time correlation functions (MTCF) for a wide class of systems. We
derive the dynamical equation of the {\it reduced propagator}, an object that
evolve state vectors of the system conditioned to the dynamics of its
environment, which is not necessarily at the vacuum state at the initial time.
Such reduced propagator is the essential piece to obtain multiple-time
correlation functions. An average over the different environmental histories of
the reduced propagator permits us to obtain the evolution equations of the
multiple-time correlation functions. We also study the evolution of MTCF within
the weak coupling limit and it is shown that the multiple-time correlation
function of some observables satisfy the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT),
whereas other correlations do not. We set the conditions under which the
correlations satisfy the QRT. We illustrate the theory in two different cases;
first, solving an exact model for which the MTCF are explicitly given, and
second, presenting the results of a numerical integration for a system coupled
with a dissipative environment through a non-diagonal interaction.
