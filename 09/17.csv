  correction",,"10.1086/425959",,"astro-ph",,"  The radiation pressure of a radio pulsar does not necessarily disrupt a
surrounding disk. The position of the inner radius of a thin disk around a
neutron star can be estimated by comparing the electromagnetic energy density
generated by the neutron star with the kinetic energy density of the disk.
Inside the light cylinder, the near zone electromagnetic field is essentially
the dipole magnetic field, and the inner radius is the conventional Alfven
radius. Far outside the light cylinder, in the radiation zone, $E=B$ and the
electromagnetic energy density is $<S >/c \propto 1/r^2$ where $S$ is the
Poynting vector. Shvartsman (1970) argued that a stable equilibrium can not be
found in the radiative zone because the electromagnetic energy density
dominates over the kinetic energy density, with the relative strength of the
electromagnetic stresses increasing with radius. In order to check whether this
is true also near the light cylinder, we employ global electromagnetic field
solutions for rotating oblique magnetic dipoles (Deutsch 1955). Near the light
cylinder the electromagnetic energy density increases steeply enough with
decreasing $r$ to balance the kinetic energy density at a stable equilibrium.
The transition from the near zone to the radiation zone is broad. The radiation
pressure of the pulsar can not disrupt the disk for values of the inner radius
up to about twice the light cylinder radius if the rotation axis and the
magnetic axis are orthogonal. This allowed range beyond the light cylinder
extends much further for small inclination angles. We discuss implications of
this result for accretion driven millisecond pulsars and young neutron stars
with fallback disks.

rotate faster and rotation will play a more dominant role in the star's
explosion. The final angular momentum of the core is determined - to within a
factor of two - by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the lighter

transformation of their morphologies, star formation rates, and gas content.
The physical mechanisms that trigger and govern these transformations may
depend strongly on environment. This contribution aims to illustrate that the
morphological and kinematic characteristics of the cold gas provide a sensitive

caused by variations in the altitudes, distributions, and thicknesses of

the sensitivity of the K-band flux to pressure induced H_2 opacity, which
itself is sensitive to surface gravity. The M' luminosities of late-T dwarfs
are 1.5-2.5 times fainter than predicted under conditions of chemical

trigonometric parallaxes have been measured. We find that T_eff ~ 1450 K for
types L7-T4, which supports recent models that attribute the changing JHK-band
luminosities and spectral features across the L-T transition to rapid changes
in the condensate clouds over a narrow range of T_eff. We compute T_eff =
600-750 K for 2MASS 0415-0935 (T9), which supplants Gl 570D as the coolest

such a question will not be answered on the basis only of observational data.
However, it is possible to diminish the range of possibilities for this dark
component by comparing different dark energy scenarios and finding which models
can be ruled out by current observations. In this paper, by asssuming three
distinct parametrizations for the low-redshift evolution of the dark energy
equation of state (EOS), we consider the possibility of discriminating between
evolving dark energy and $\Lambda$CDM models from a joint analysis involving
the most recent radio sources gravitational lensing sample, namely, the Cosmic
All Sky Survey (CLASS) statistical data and the recently published \emph{gold}

data restricts considerably the dark energy parameter space, which enables
possible distinctions between time-dependent and constant EOS's.

formal equivalence moreover allows very simple physical interpretations of
interference features surviving under thermal averaging. Simply put, pieces of
thermal wavepacket returning to the QPC along independent paths must arrive at
the same time in order to interfere. Remarkably, one immediate result of this
approach is that higher temperature leads to narrower wavepackets and therefore
better resolution of events in the time domain. In effect, experiments at 4.2 K

giving rise to a highly nontrivial k-dependence of the gap function, is known
to enhance the critical temperature Tc in a natural way. As a consequence, we

equation as a system of first order differential equations. In this way we get
a system that has the form of an advection equation. This is used in
combination with a series expansion of the solution in powers of time. To
obtain a fourth order scheme we kept terms up to fourth derivative in time and
use the advection-like system of differential equations to substitute the
temporal derivatives by spatial derivatives. A local stability study leads to a
Courant factor of 1.5 for the nonrotating case. This scheme is used to evolve
gravitational perturbations in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds. Our
numerical method proved to be fourth order convergent in r* and theta
directions. The correct power-law tail, ~1/t^{2\ell+3}, for general initial
data, and ~1/t^{2\ell+4}, for time symmetric data, was found in the simulations
where the duration in time of the tail phase was long enough. We verified that
it is crucial to resolve accurately the angular dependence of the mode at late
times in order to obtain these values of the exponents in the power-law decay.
In other cases, when the decay was too fast and round-off error was reached
before a tail was developed, the quasinormal modes frequencies provided a test

  String Field Theory","29 pages, 21 figures",,,,"hep-th",,"  A recent paper by Gross and Erler (hep-th/0406199) showed that by making a
certain well-defined, unitary transformation on the mode basis for the open
bosonic string--one that identifies the lightcone component of position with
the string midpoint--it is possible to render the action for cubic string field
theory local in lightcone time. In this basis, then, cubic string field theory
possesses a well-defined initial value formulation and a conserved Hamiltonian.
With this new understanding it seems natural to study time dependent solutions
representing the the decay of an unstable D-branes. In this paper we study such
solutions using level truncation of mode oscillators in the lightcone basis,
finding both homogenous solutions by perturbatively expanding the string field
in modes $e^{nt}$, and inhomogenous solutions by integrating the equations of
motion on a lattice. Truncating the theory to level $(\tilde{2},\tilde{4})$ in
$\alpha^+$ oscillators, we find time dependent solutions whose behavior seems
to converge to that of earlier solutions constructed in the center of mass
basis, where the cubic action contains an infinite number of time derivatives.
We further construct time-dependent inhomogeneous solutions including all
fields up to level $(\tilde{2},\tilde{4})$. These solutions at the outset
display rather erratic behavior due to an unphysical instability introduced by
truncating the theory at the linear level. However upon truncating away the
field responsible for the instability, we find more reasonable solutions which
may possibly represent an approximation to tachyon matter. We conclude with
some discussion of future directions.

theory and $SL_2$ trace identities. The second source comes from geometric
properties of groups acting on real trees and a certain power redistribution

Harish-Chandra modules which are not Harish-Chandra modules or weight modules
of finite type. For an arbitrary algebraic reductive pair of complex Lie
algebras $(\g,\k)$, we construct, via cohomological induction, the fundamental
series $F^\cdot (\p,E)$ of generalized Harish-Chandra modules. We then use
$F^\cdot (\p,E)$ to characterize any simple generalized Harish-Chandra module
with generic minimal $\k$-type. More precisely, we prove that any such simple
$(\g,\k)$-module of finite type arises as the unique simple submodule of an
appropriate fundamental series module $F^s(\p,E)$ in the middle dimension $s$.
Under the stronger assumption that $\k$ contains a semisimple regular element
of $\g$, we prove that any simple $(\g,\k)$-module with generic minimal
$\k$-type is necessarily of finite type, and hence obtain a reconstruction
theorem for a class of simple $(\g,\k)$-modules which can a priori have
infinite type. We also obtain generic general versions of some classical
theorems of Harish-Chandra, such as the Harish-Chandra admissibility theorem.
The paper is concluded by examples, in particular we compute the genericity
condition on a $\k$-type for any pair $(\g,\k)$ with $\k\simeq s\ell (2)$.

discretization of certain dynamical systems. This generalizes earlier work on
discretization of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on tangent bundles and
cotangent bundles respectively. In particular we show how to obtain a large
class of discrete algorithms using this geometric approach. We give new
geometric insight into the Newmark model for example and we give a direct
discrete formulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi method. Moreover we extend these
ideas to deriving a discrete version of the maximum principle for smooth
optimal control problems. We define discrete variational principles that are
the discrete counterpart of known variational principles. For dynamical
systems, we introduce principles of critical action on both the tangent bundle
and the cotangent bundle. These two principles are equivalent and allow one to
recover most of the classical symplectic algorithms. We also identify a class
of coordinate transformations that leave the variational principles presented
in this paper invariant and develop a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi theory. This
theory allows us to show that the energy error in the (symplectic) integration
of a dynamical system is invariant under discrete canonical transformations.
Finally, for optimal control problems we develop a discrete maximum principle
that yields discrete necessary conditions for optimality. These conditions are
in agreement with the usual conditions obtained from Pontryagin maximum
principle. We illustrate our approach with an example of a sub-Riemannian
optimal control.

appreciable contribution to the muon-positron conversion rate. This specific
feature is absent in the allied case of neutrinoless double beta decay. Using
the present neutrino oscillations, tritium beta decay, accelerator and
cosmological data we derived the limits on the effective masses of light

muon-positron nuclear conversion, corresponding to these limits, were found to
be so small that even within a distant future the muon-positron conversion
experiments will hardly be able to detect the neutrino signal. Therefore,
searches for this LNV process can only rely on the presence of certain physics
beyond the trivial extension of the Standard Model by inclusion of massive

of a chain are pulled apart, the force transmitted by each crosslink increases
until it ruptures. The stochastic crosslink rupture process is assumed to be
governed by first order kinetics with a rate that depends exponentially on the
transmitted force. We have performed random searches to identify optimal
crosslink configurations whose unfolding requires a large applied force
(measure of strength) and/or large dissipated energy (measure of toughness). We
found that such optimal chains always involve cross-links arranged to form
parallel strands. The location of those optimal strands generally depends on
the loading rate. Optimal chains with a small number of cross-links were found
to be almost as strong and tough as optimal chains with a large number of
cross-links. Furthermore, optimality of chains with a small number of
cross-links can be easily destroyed by adding cross-links at random. The
present findings are relevant for the interpretation of single molecule force

method for quantifying the relevance of different mediators in the immune

indicates that its mediators significantly differ in their network relevance.
We found that cytokines involved in innate immunity and inflammation and some
hormones rank highest in the network, revealing that the most prominent
mediators of the IS are molecules involved in these ancestral types of defence
mechanisms highly integrated with the adaptive immune response, and at the
interplay among the nervous, the endocrine and the immune systems.

atoms as equidistant sideband frequencies with the space between adjacent peaks
to be inversely proportional to the value of the period of the respective limit
cycle. With increasing the intensity of the laser field, we observe numerically
cascades of bifurcations that eventually end up in settling a strange chaotic
attractor. A broadband noise is shown to destroy a fine structure of the
bifurcation scenario, but prominent features of period-1 and period-3 limit
cycles survive under a weak noise. The character of the atomic motion is
analyzed with the help of the friction force whose zeroes are attractor or
repellor points in the velocity space. We find ranges of the laser parameters
where the atomic motion resembles a random but deterministic walking of atoms
erratically jumping between different wells of the optical potential. Such a
random walking is shown to be fractal in the sense that the measured
characteristic of the motion, time of exit of atoms from a given space of the

the second part of the paper we pursue another approach based on reduction of
the problem to representation theory of the symmetric group.

A 38, 3381 (2005)","10.1088/0305-4470/38/15/010",,"quant-ph",,"  A Lie-algebraic approach successfully used to describe one-dimensional Bloch
oscillations in a tight-binding approximation is extended to two dimensions.
This extension has the same algebraic structure as the one-dimensional case
while the dynamics shows a much richer behaviour. The Bloch oscillations are
discussed using analytical expressions for expectation values and widths of the
operators of the algebra. It is shown under which conditions the oscillations
survive in two dimensions and the centre of mass of a wave packet shows a
Lissajous like motion. In contrast to the one-dimensional case, a wavepacket
shows systematic dispersion that depends on the direction of the field and the
dispersion relation of the field free system.
