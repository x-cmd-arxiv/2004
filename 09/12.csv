however, shows strong indications that it is composed of material swept-up by
the expansion of Sgr A East. Using the mass and kinematics of the western
streamer, we calculate an energy of E=(2-9)x10^{51} ergs for the progenitor
explosion and conclude that Sgr A East was most likely produced by a single
supernova. The temperature structure of molecular gas in the central ~20pc is
also analyzed in detail. We find that molecular gas has a ``two-temperature''
structure similar to that measured by Huttemeister et al. (2003a) on larger
scales. The largest observed line ratios, however, cannot be understood in
terms of a two-temperature model, and most likely result from absorption of
NH3(3,3) emission by cool surface layers of clouds. By comparing the observed
NH3 (6,6)-to-(3,3) line ratios, we disentangle three distinct molecular
features within a projected distance of 2pc from Sgr A*. Gas associated with
the highest line ratios shows kinematic signatures of both rotation and
expansion. The southern streamer shows no significant velocity gradients and
does not appear to be directly associated with either the circumnuclear disk or
the nucleus. The paper concludes with a discussion of the line-of-sight

north-northeast and 26"" southwest from the core were also detected. Using a
Raymond-Smith model, the first hotspot can be characterized with a thermal
plasma temperature of 2.6$\times10^6$ K and an electron number density of 0.17
cm$^{-3}$. These values correspond to a cooling time of about 1.6$\times10^7$
yr. In addition, an emission line from the hotspot, possibly Fe xxv, was
detected at rest wavelength 10.04\AA.
  The thermal X-ray emission from the first hotspot is offset from the radio
emission but is coincident with optical filaments detected with broadband
filters of HST/WFPC2. The best explanation for the X-ray, radio, and optical
emission is that of a `jet-cloud' interaction.
  The diffuse emission around the nucleus of PKS 2152-699 can be modeled as a
thermal plasma with a temperature of 1.2$\times10^7$ K and a luminosity of
1.8$\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This emission appears to be asymmetric with a
small extension toward Hotspot A, similar to a jet. An optical hotspot (EELR)
is seen less than an arcsecond away from this extension in the direction of the
core. This indicates that the extension may be caused by the jet interacting
with an inner ISM cloud, but entrainment of hot gas is unavoidable. Future

between an increasing energy factor and a phase-space suppression leads to a
{\it strong new upper bound} on the scale of fermion mass generation at a
finite value $n=n_s$, which is {\it independent of the EWSB scale,} $v =
(\sqrt{2}G_F)^{-1/2}$. For quarks, leptons and Majorana neutrinos, the
strongest 2 --> n limits range from about 3TeV to 130-170TeV (with $2\lesssim
n_s \lesssim 24$), depending on the measured fermion masses. Strikingly, given
the tiny neutrino masses as constrained by the neutrino oscillations,
neutrinoless double-beta decays and astrophysical observations, the unitarity
violation of $\nu_L\nu_L\to nW_L^a$ scattering actually occurs at a scale no
higher than ~170 TeV. Implications for various mechanisms of neutrino mass
generation are analyzed. On the other hand, for the 2 --> n pure
Goldstone-boson scattering, we find that the decreasing phase space factor
always dominates over the growing overall energy factor when $n$ becomes large,
so that the best unitarity bound on the scale of EWSB remains at n=2.

theories with the superconformal SU(2,2|N) symmetry should possess universal
integrability properties for different N. We provide further support for this
conjecture by computing a one-loop dilatation operator in all (super)symmetric
Yang-Mills theories on the light-cone ranging from gluodynamics all the way to
the maximally supersymmetric N=4 theory. We demonstrate that the dilatation
operator takes a remarkably simple form when realized in the space spanned by
single-trace products of superfields separated by light-like distances. The
latter operators serve as generating functions for Wilson operators of the
maximal Lorentz spin and the scale dependence of the two are in the one-to-one
correspondence with each other. In the maximally supersymmetric, N=4 theory all
nonlocal light-cone operators are built from a single CPT self-conjugated
superfield while for N=0,1,2 one has to deal with two distinct superfields and
distinguish three different types of such operators. We find that for the
light-cone operators built from only one species of superfields, the one-loop
dilatation operator takes the same, universal form in all SYM theories and it
can be mapped in the multi-color limit into a Hamiltonian of the SL(2|N)
Heisenberg (super)spin chain of length equal to the number of superfields
involved. For ""mixed'' light-cone operators involving both superfields the
dilatation operator for N<=2 receives an additional contribution from the
exchange interaction between superfields on the light-cone which breaks its
integrability symmetry and creates a mass gap in the spectrum of anomalous
dimensions.

complexification G^\mathbb C, then Z:=G^\mathbb C/Q is a compact complex
homogeneous manifold. Moreover, G as well as K^\mathbb C, the complexification
of the maximal compact subgroup of G, acts naturally on Z with finitely many
orbits. For any G-orbit, there exist a K^\mathbb C-orbit so that their
intersection is non-empty and compact. This duality relation with consideration
of cycle intersection at the boundary of a G-orbit lead to the definition of
the cycle space associated to any G-orbit. Methods involving Schubert
varieties, transversal Schubert slices together with geometric properties of a
certain complementary incidence hypersurface and results about the open orbits
yield a complete characterisation of the cycle space associated to an arbitrary
G-orbit. In particular, it is shown that all the cycle spaces except in a few
Hermitian cases are equivalent to the domain $\Omega_{AG}$. In the exceptional
Hermitian cases, the cycle spaces are equivalent to the associated bounded
