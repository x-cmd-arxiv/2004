with the interpretation of this ULX as a black hole (BH) accreting from a
high-mass donor star in its supergiant phase, via Roche-lobe overflow. The
observed optical colors and the blue-to-red supergiant ratio suggest a low
metal abundance: 0.2 <~ Z/Z_sun <~ 0.4 (Padua tracks), or 0.05 <~ Z/Z_sun <~
0.2 (Geneva tracks). The age of the star-forming complex is <~ 30 Myr. H-alpha
images show that this region has a ring-like appearance. We propose that it is
an expanding wave of star formation, triggered by an initial density
perturbation, in a region where the gas was only marginally stable to
gravitational collapse. A possible trigger was the collision with a satellite
dwarf galaxy, visible a few arcsec north-west of the complex, going through the
gas-rich outer disk of NGC4559. The X-ray data favour a BH more massive (M > 50
M_sun) than typical Milky Way BH candidates. The optical data favour a
``young'' BH originating in the recent episode of massive star formation;
however, they also rule out an association with young massive star clusters. We
speculate that other mechanisms may lead to the formation of relatively massive
BHs (~ 50-100 M_sun) from stellar evolution processes in low-metallicity
environments, or when star formation is triggered by galactic collisions.

  Implications for galaxy ages and metallicities","12 pages, 9 figures. Accepted by AJ",,"10.1086/426336",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an analysis of the color-magnitude-velocity dispersion relation
for a sample of 39320 early-type galaxies within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
We demonstrate that the color-magnitude relation is entirely a consequence of
the fact that both the luminosities and colors of these galaxies are correlated
with stellar velocity dispersions. Previous studies of the color-magnitude
relation over a range of redshifts suggest that the luminosity of an early-type
galaxy is an indicator of its metallicity, whereas residuals in color from the
relation are indicators of the luminosity-weighted age of its stars. We show
that this, when combined with our finding that velocity dispersion plays a
crucial role, has a number of interesting implications. First, galaxies with
large velocity dispersions tend to be older (i.e., they scatter redward of the
color-magnitude relation). Similarly, galaxies with large dynamical mass
estimates also tend to be older. In addition, at fixed luminosity, galaxies
which are smaller, or have larger velocity dispersions, or are more massive,
tend to be older. Second, models in which galaxies with the largest velocity
dispersions are also the most metal poor are difficult to reconcile with our
data. However, at fixed velocity dispersion, galaxies have a range of ages and
metallicities: the older galaxies have smaller metallicities, and vice-versa.
Finally, a plot of velocity dispersion versus luminosity can be used as an age
indicator: lines of constant age run parallel to the correlation between
velocity dispersion and luminosity.

Eddington limit (Ledd). We begin by reviewing the instabilities that are
expected to form extensive structure near Ledd. We investigate how this
""porosity"" can reduce the effective coupling between the matter and radiation.
Introducing a new ""porosity-length'' formalism, we derive a simple scaling for
the reduced effective opacity, and use this to derive an associated scaling for
the porosity-moderated, continuum-driven mass loss rate from stars that
formally exceed Ledd. For a simple super-Eddington model with a single porosity
length that is assumed to be on the order of the gravitational scale height,
the overall mass loss is similar to that derived in previous porosity work.
This is much higher than is typical of line-driven winds, but is still only a
few percent of the photon tiring limit--for which the luminosity becomes
insufficient to carry the flow out of the gravitational potential. To obtain
still stronger mass loss that approaches observationally inferred values near
this limit, we introduce a power-law-porosity model in which the associated
structure has a broad range of scales. We show that the mass loss rate can be
enhanced by a factor that increases with the Eddington parameter Gamma, such
that for moderately large Gamma (> 3-4), mass loss rates could approach the
photon tiring limit. Together with the ability to drive quite fast outflow
speeds, the derived mass loss could explain the large inferred mass loss and
flow speeds of giant outbursts in eta Carinae and other LBV stars.

to be produced predominantly in the envelopes of evolved (age >1 Gyr), low-mass

discovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshift

supernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the early

considerably lower than those of a cold NS, and are further lowered by
rotation; consequently, if QNMs were excited in a sufficiently energetic

resonant-mass and interferometric detectors than those emitted by a cold NS. We
find that for high rotation rates, some of the g-modes become unstable via the
CFS instability; however, this instability is likely to be suppressed by
competing mechanisms before emitting a significant amount of gravitational

giants in the solar neighbourhood which includes for the first time radial
velocity data from a large survey performed with the CORAVEL
spectrovelocimeter. It also uses proper motions from the Tycho-2 catalogue,
which are expected to be more accurate than the Hipparcos ones. The UV-plane
constructed from these data for the stars with precise parallaxes reveals a
rich small-scale structure, with several clumps corresponding to the Hercules
stream, the Sirius moving group, and the Hyades and Pleiades superclusters. A
maximum-likelihood method, based on a bayesian approach, has been applied to
the data, in order to make full use of all the available stars and to derive
the kinematic properties of these subgroups. Isochrones in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram reveal a very wide range of ages for stars
belonging to these groups. These groups are most probably related to the
dynamical perturbation by transient spiral waves rather than to cluster
remnants. A possible explanation for the presence of young clusters in the same
area of the UV-plane is that they have been put there by the spiral wave
associated with their formation, while the kinematics of the older stars of our
sample has also been disturbed by the same wave. The term ""dynamical stream""

and clarifying the correct use of the observed abundance ratios in several
astrophysical contests. In particular, we start from the well known fact that
abundance ratios depend on stellar yields, initial mass function and stellar
lifetimes and we show, by means of specific examples, that in some cases it is
not correct to infer constraints on the contributions from different SN types
(Ia, II), and particularly on different sets of yields, in the absence of a
complete chemical evolution model taking into account stellar lifetimes. In
spite of the fact that some of these results should be well known, we believe
that it is useful to discuss the meaning of abundance ratios in the light of
severel recent claims based upon an incorrect interpretation of observed
abundance ratios. In particular, the procedure, often used in the recent
literature, of deriving directly conclusions about stellar nucleosynthesis,
just by relating abundance ratios to yield ratios, implicitly assumes the
instantaneous recycling approximation (I.R.A.). This approximation is clearly
not correct when one analyzes the contributions of SNIa relative to SNII as
functions of cosmic time. In this paper we show that the uncertainty which
arises from adopting this oversimplified procedure in a variety of
astrophysical objects, such as elliptical galaxies, the intracluster medium and
high redshift objects, does not allow us to draw any firm conclusion, and that
the differences between abundance ratios predicted by models with I.R.A. and

between different sets of yields. (Abridged)

effective in slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows in

virializing at early times are the sites of faster star formation. The
correspondingly higher radiation drag causes a faster angular momentum loss by
the gas and induces a larger accretion rate onto the central black hole. In
turn, the kinetic energy of the outflows powered by the active nuclei can
unbind the residual gas in a time shorter for larger halos. The model accounts
for a broad variety of dynamical, photometric and metallicity properties of
early-type galaxies, for the M_BH -- \sigma relation and for the local

We searched for emission from H_2 at 1050 and 1100 A, motivated by the

probability of measuring the Einstein radius \theta_E for bound and
free-floating planets. We carry out detailed simulations of the planetary

uncertainty in \theta_E for these events. We show that, for main-sequence
sources and Jupiter-mass planets, the caustic structure of wide-separation
planets with projected separations of < 20 AU substantially increases the
probability of measuring the dimensionless source size and thus determining
\theta_E compared to the case of unbound planets. In this limit where the
source is much smaller than the caustic, the effective cross-section to measure
\theta_E to 10% is ~25% larger than the full width of the caustic. Measurement
of the lens parallax is possible for low-mass planetary events by combined
observations from the ground and a satellite located in an L2 orbit; this would
complete the mass measurements for such wide-separation planets. Finally,
short-duration events caused by bound planets can be routinely distinguished
from those caused by free-floating planets for planet-star separations < 20 AU
from either the deviations due to the planetary caustic or (more often) the
low-amplitude bump from the magnification due to the parent star.

frequency, there is an increase in intensity by four orders of magnitude. The

pressure. Moreover, $T_c$ in $\kappa$-$($ET$)_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$ increases under
c-axis pressure up to 1kbar and decreases under higher pressure, while $T_c$
decreases monotonically under the hydrostatic pressure, or under the uniaxial
pressure parallel to other axes. In order to explain these behaviors, we
calculate $T_c$ and $\lambda ^{- 2}$ for $\kappa$-$($ET$)_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$ under
pressure. In the calculation we mainly use an effective dimer Hubbard model. In
conclusion, the behavior of $\lambda ^{- 2}$ results from three effects: the
variation of the bandwidth of quasiparticles, the change of the Fermi surfaces,
and the effect of vertex correction. This is a different mechanism from that of
$\lambda ^{- 2}$ in cuprates which we observe when the doping varies. Moreover,
we explain the increase in $T_c$ under the c-axis pressure up to 1kbar and the
decrease in $T_c$ over 1kbar from our calculation. With the increase in the
c-axis pressure, two competitive effects with respect to $T_c$ appear. One is
the approach of the Fermi surface to the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone
boundary, and the other is the suppression of the electron correlation. Under
the low c-axis pressure, $T_c$ increases since the former effect is dominant.
On the other hand, $T_c$ decreases since the latter effect is dominant under
the high c-axis pressure.

thermodynamic limit. The equilibrium distribution function is solution of an
integrodifferential equation obtained from a static BBGKY-like hierarchy. It
also optimizes a thermodynamical potential (entropy or free energy) under
appropriate constraints. We discuss the kinetic theory of these systems. In the
$N\to +\infty$ limit, a Hamiltonian system is described by the Vlasov equation.
To order 1/N, the collision term of a homogeneous system has the form of the
Lenard-Balescu operator. It reduces to the Landau operator when collective
effects are neglected. We also consider the motion of a test particle in a bath
of field particles and derive the general form of the Fokker-Planck equation.
The diffusion coefficient is anisotropic and depends on the velocity of the
test particle. This can lead to anomalous diffusion. For Brownian systems, in
the $N\to +\infty$ limit, the kinetic equation is a non-local Kramers equation.
In the strong friction limit $\xi\to +\infty$, or for large times $t\gg
\xi^{-1}$, it reduces to a non-local Smoluchowski equation. We give explicit
results for self-gravitating systems, two-dimensional vortices and for the HMF

of generalized thermodynamics can emerge in complex systems displaying

nearly independent of Mn content (for 0.02<x<0.05). At lower temperatures
GaMnAs layers with metallic-type conductivity show an additional contribution
to the thermoelectric power with the maximum close to the Curie temperature.
The layers exhibiting insulating electrical properties show 1/T-type increase
of thermoelectric power at low temperatures.

holds during all of its subintervals). Among other things, these assumptions
raise the ""conflicting"" problem of overlapping truths, which the work solves

symmetry breaking can be effectively decoupled if the physics above the TeV
scale is strongly conformal, and the electroweak order parameter has a scaling
dimension d = 1 + epsilon with epsilon \simeq 1/few. There are many
restrictions on small values of epsilon: for epsilon << 1, electroweak symmetry
breaking requires a fine-tuning similar to that of the standard model; large-N
conformal field theories (including those obtained from the AdS/CFT
correspondence) require fine-tuning for d < 2; `walking technicolor' theories
cannot have d < 2, according to gap equation analyses. However, strong small-N
conformal field theories with epsilon \simeq 1/few avoid all these constraints,
and can give rise to natural dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with a top
quark flavor scale of order 10^{1/epsilon} TeV, large enough to decouple
flavor. Small-N theories also have an acceptably small Peskin-Takeuchi S
parameter. This class of theories provides a new direction for dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking without problems from flavor or electroweak
precision tests. A possible signal for these theories is a prominent scalar
resonance below the TeV scale with couplings similar to a heavy standard model
Higgs.

are proportional to a low scale, f, of lepton flavor symmetry breaking. This
mechanism is testable because the resulting pseudo-Goldstone bosons, of mass
m_G, couple strongly with the neutrinos, affecting the acoustic oscillations
during the eV era of the early universe that generate the peaks in the CMB
radiation. Characteristic signals result over a very wide range of (f, m_G)
because of a change in the total relativistic energy density and because the
neutrinos scatter rather than free-stream. Thermodynamics allows a precise
calculation of the signal, so that observations would not only confirm the
late-time neutrino mass mechanism, but could also determine whether the
neutrino spectrum is degenerate, inverted or hierarchical and whether the
neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana.
  The flavor symmetries could also give light sterile states. If the masses of
the sterile neutrinos turn on after the MeV era, the LSND oscillations can be
explained without upsetting big bang nucleosynthesis, and, since the sterile
states decay to lighter neutrinos and pseudo-Goldstones, without giving too
much hot dark matter.

neutralinos as NLSPs, leaving charged sleptons with lifetimes below a year as
the natural NLSP candidates. Decays to gravitinos may therefore be observed by
trapping slepton NLSPs in water tanks placed outside Large Hadron Collider

This picture leads to substantially different antishadowing for charged and

change from the longitudinal to transverse polarization. In this way a
significant reduction of the longitudinal polarization fraction can be
produced. In the factorization approximation we find agreement with recent data
from the BaBar and Belle collaborations in the B => K* phi decay channel, as a
result of an appropriate choice of semileptonic form factors and Regge
exchanges. On the other hand, data for the K* rho decay channels appear more
elusive. The soft effects discussed in the present paper are based on a model

energy theory as a gas of electrically and magnetically charged black holes.
This gas of black holes quickly captures the moduli which appear in the
relation between black hole masses and charges, and slows them down with their
vevs typically close to the Planck scale. From there, the modulus may slowly
roll into a valley with a positive vacuum energy, where inflation may begin.
The black hole gas will redshift away in the course of cosmic expansion, as
inflation evicts black holes out of the horizon.

correspondences between certain automorphic representations of G and
representations of a group G' isomorphic to G except at infinity can be
realized in the cohomology of Shimura varieties attached to G and G'.
  We obtain these Jacquet-Langlands correspondences by studying the bad
reduction of a Shimura variety X attached to G at a prime p for which X has
maximal parabolic level structure. We construct a ""Deligne-Rapoport"" model for
X and show that the irreducible components of its special fiber have a global
structure that can be explicitly described in terms of Shimura varieties X' for
unitary groups G' isomorphic to G except at infinity.
  The weight spectral sequence of Rapoport-Zink then yields an expression for
certain pieces of the weight filtration on the etale cohomology of X in terms
of the cohomology of a suitable X'. This identifies a piece of this weight
filtration with a space of algebraic modular forms for G'. A consequence is
certain cases of the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between G and G' in terms
of a canonical isomorphism between spaces of arithmetic interest, rather than
simply as an abstract bijection between isomorphism classes of representations.

spectra as well as the angular distributions of the 10Be+n center of mass have
been extracted for both targets. For the breakup on Pb target, the selection of
forward scattering angles is found to be effective to extract almost purely the
first-order E1 Coulomb breakup component, and to exclude the nuclear
contribution and higher-order Coulomb breakup components. This angle-selected
energy spectrum is thus used to deduce the spectroscopic factor for the
10Be(0+) 2s_1/2 configuration in 11Be which is found to be 0.72+-0.04 with
B(E1) up to Ex=4 MeV of 1.05+-0.06 e2fm2. The energy weighted E1 strength up to
Ex=4 MeV explains 70+-10% of the cluster sum rule, consistent with the obtained
spectroscopic factor. The non-energy weighted sum rule is used to extract the
root mean square distance of the halo neutron to be 5.77(16) fm, consistent
with previously known values. In the breakup with C target, we have observed
the excitations to the known unbound states in 11Be at Ex=1.78 MeV and 3.41

the Eocene, the Last Glacial Maximum, the 20th century, as well as the 11-yr
solar cycle. This enables us to place quantitative limits on climate
sensitivity to both changes in the CRF, Phi_CR, and the radiative budget, F,
under equilibrium. Under the assumption that the CRF is indeed a climate
driver, we find that the sensitivity to CRF variations is consistently fitted
with mu := -Phi_0 (dT_global/ d Phi_CR) = 6.5 +/- 2.5 K (where Phi_0 is the CR
energy flux today). Additionally, the sensitivity to radiative forcing changes
is lambda := dT_global/ dF_0 = 0.35 +/- 0.09 K/(W/m^2), at the current
temperature, while its temperature derivative is negligible with d lambda /
dT_0 = 0.01 +/- 0.03 1/(W/m^2). If the observed CRF/climate link is ignored,
the best sensitivity obtained is lambda = 0.54 +/- 0.12 K/(W/m^2) and d lambda
/ dT_0 = -0.02 +/- 0.05 1/(W/m^2). The CRF/climate link therefore implies that
the increased solar luminosity and reduced CRF over the previous century should
have contributed a warming of 0.37+/-0.13 K, while the rest should be mainly
attributed to anthropogenic causes. Without any effect of cosmic rays, the
increase in solar luminosity would correspond to an increased temperature of

strengths are allowed to depend on position. The ensuing Hamiltonian is
expressed in terms of canonical fields, and diagonalised by performing a
normal-mode expansion. The commutation relations of the diagonalising operators
are in agreement with the canonical commutation relations. For the proof we
replace all sums of normal modes by complex integrals with the help of the
residue theorem. The same technique helps us to explicitly calculate the
quantum evolution of all canonical and electromagnetic fields. We identify the
dielectric constant and the Green function of the wave equation for the
electric field. Both functions are meromorphic in the complex frequency plane.
The solution of the extended Ullersma model is in keeping with well-known
phenomenological rules for setting up quantum electrodynamics in an absorptive
and spatially inhomogeneous dielectric. To establish this fundamental
justification, we subject the reservoir of independent harmonic oscillators to
a continuum limit. The resonant frequencies of the reservoir are smeared out
over the real axis. Consequently, the poles of both the dielectric constant and
the Green function unite to form a branch cut. Performing an analytic
continuation beyond this branch cut, we find that the long-time behaviour of
the quantised electric field is completely determined by the sources of the
reservoir. Through a Riemann-Lebesgue argument we demonstrate that the field
itself tends to zero, whereas its quantum fluctuations stay alive. We argue
that the last feature may have important consequences for application of
entanglement and related processes in quantum devices.
