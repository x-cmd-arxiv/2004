in both NICMOS bands, J and H. The selection criteria for this sample are
(z-J)>0.8, (z-J) > 0.66 (J-H)+0.8, (J-H)<1.2, and no detection at <8500
Angstroms. The 5 selected sources have total magnitudes H~27. Four of the five
sources are quite blue compared to typical lower-redshift dropout galaxies and
are clustered within a 1 arcmin**2 region. Because all 5 sources are near the
limit of the NICMOS data, we have carefully evaluated their reality. Each of
the candidates is visible in different splits of the data and a median stack.
We analyzed several noise images and estimate the number of spurious sources to
be 1+/-1. A search using an independent reduction of this same data set clearly
revealed 3 of the 5 candidates and weakly detected a 4th candidate, suggesting
the contamination could be higher. For comparison with predictions from lower
redshift samples we take a conservative approach and adopt four z~7-8 galaxies
as our sample. With the same detection criteria on simulated datasets, assuming
no-evolution from z~3.8, we predict 10 sources at z~7-8, or 14 if we use a more
realistic (1+z)^{-1} size scaling. We estimate that the rest-frame continuum UV
(~1800 Angstroms) luminosity density at z~7.5 (integrated down to 0.3L*) is
just 0.20_{-0.08}^{+0.12}x that found at z~3.8. Effectively this sets an upper
limit on the luminosity density down to 0.3 L*. This result is consistent with
significant evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function from z~7.5
to z~3.8. Even with the lower UV luminosity density at z~7.5, it appears that
galaxies could still play an important role in reionization at these redshifts,
though definitive measurements remain to be made. [abridged]

between scattering of line emission by a disk that reaches the stellar surface,

position-angle rotations, similar to those predicted by analytic models. For
the case of an undisrupted disk, we find double rotations in the position angle

finite-sized star interacting with the disk's rotational velocity field. Since
a gradual increase of the hole size transforms the double rotations smoothly
back into single ones -- as the line emission object approaches that of a point
source -- our models demonstrate the diagnostic potential of line polarimetry
in determining not only the disk inclination, but also the size of the disk
inner hole. Our models are generic, and relevant to any line emitting object
that is embedded in a rotating disk. Examples are: Herbig Ae stars, T Tauri

astronomy in the foreseeable future must be widely anticipated to proceed with
the designing and building of a new instrumentation, which is primarily
intended for the further drastic reduction of the energy threshold in gamma-ray
observations down to about 10 GeV. On the ground one can hardly reach such low
energy thresholds without considerably larger, up to 30 m diameter, optical
telescopes, which might be able to collect sufficient amount of Cherenkov light
from the atmospheric gamma-ray showers of that low energy. If not taken off the
ground entirely (like GLAST), then it seems to be profitable to mount future
low energy Cherenkov telescopes at higher altitudes in the atmosphere in order
that they will be able to detect substantially more unabsorbed Cherenkov light
from a shower. There are a few sites up on the high mountains of roughly 5 km
height worldwide, which can be used for such a venture. However, one has to
remember that actual time profile, and in particular a two-dimensional

\~4.5, based on B, I and (I+B) selected galaxy catalogues from the FORS Deep

are computed from spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts accurate
to (Delta_z / (z_spec+1)) ~0.03 for the FDF and ~0.056 for the GOODS-South
field. The SFRs are derived from the luminosities at 1500 Angstroem. We find
that the total SFR estimates derived from B, I and I+B catalogues agree very
well ($\lsim 0.1$ dex) while the SFR from the K catalogue is lower by ~0.2 dex.
We show that the latter is solely due to the lower star-forming activity of
K-selected intermediate and low luminosity (L<L_*) galaxies. The SFR of bright
(L>L_*) galaxies is independent of the selection band, i.e. the same for B, I,
(I+B), and K-selected galaxy samples. At all redshifts, luminous galaxies
(L>L_*) contribute only ~1/3 to the total SFR. There is no evidence for
significant cosmic variance between the SFRs in the FDF and GOODs-South field,
  ~0.1 dex, consistent with theoretical expectations. The SFRs derived here are
in excellent agreement with previous measurements provided we assume the same
faint-end slope of the luminosity function as previous works (alpha ~ -1.6).
However, our deep FDF data indicate a shallower slope of alpha=-1.07, implying
a SFR lower by ~0.3 dex. We find the SFR to be roughly constant up to z ~4 and
then to decline slowly beyond, if dust extinctions are assumed to be constant
with redshift.

degree of the asphericity vary considerably. The best predictor of
core-collapse SN polarization seems to be the mass of the hydrogen envelope
that is intact at the time of the explosion: those SNe that arise from
progenitors with large, intact envelopes (e.g., Type II-plateau) have very low
polarization, while those that result from progenitors that have lost part (SN
IIb, SN IIn) or all (SN Ib) of their hydrogen (or even helium; SN Ic) layers
prior to the explosion tend to show substantial polarization. Thus, the deeper
we probe into core-collapse events, the greater the asphericity seems to be,
suggesting a fundamentally asymmetric explosion with the asymmetry damped by
the addition of envelope material.

formation of the universe. However, the mass resolution in current simulations
is still poor. Due to technical difficulties, it is necessary to use both
greatly reduced number density of particles and greatly raised unit particle
mass. Consequently, the particle masses used in cosmological simulations are
about $10^{70}$ times larger than the $Gev$ candidates in particle physics.
This is a huge physical bias that cannot be neglected when interpreting the
results of the simulations. Here we discuss how such a bias affects Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) cosmological simulations. We find that the small scale properties
of the CDM particle system are changed in two aspects. 1) An upper limit is
imposed on the spatial resolution of the simulation results. 2) Most
importantly, an unexpected short mean free path is produced, and the
corresponding two body scattering cross section is close to the value expected
in the Self-Interaction Dark Matter(SIDM) model. Since the mean free path of
real CDM particle systems is much longer than that in the simulations, our
results imply 1) that there is probably no 'cusp problem' in real CDM halos,
and 2) that a much longer time is needed to form new virialized halos in real
CDM particle systems than in the simulations. This last result can help us
understand the 'substructure problem'. Our discussion can also explain why the
massive halos in the simulations may have smaller concentration coefficients.

Here we compare three sets of single stellar population (SSP) models of Lick
indices to the high signal-to-noise, integrated spectra of 20 Galactic globular
clusters. The ages, [Fe/H] and alpha-element abundance ratios derived from the
SSP models are compared to the results of resolved stellar population studies
from the literature. We find good consistency with the published values, with
an agreement of better than 0.1 dex in all three derived parameters. The
technique allows identification of abundance ratio anomalies, such as the known
nitrogen over-abundance in Galactic globular clusters, and the presence of
anomalous horizontal-branch morphologies. It also minimises the impact on the
derived parameters of imperfect calibration to the Lick system, and reduction
errors in general. The method defined in this work is therefore robust with
respect to many of the difficulties that plague the application of SSP models
in general, and is, consequently, well suited to the study of extra-galactic
globular cluster systems.

cores using the IRAM 30m telescope. Our main objective has been to determine
the abundance ratio of N2D+ and N2H+ towards the nuclei of these cores and thus
to obtain estimates of the degree of deuterium enrichment, a symptom of
advanced chemical evolution according to current models. We find that the
N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) ratio is larger in more ""centrally concentrated cores"" with
larger peak H2 and N2H+ column density than the sample mean. The deuterium
enrichment in starless cores is presently ascribed to depletion of CO in the
high density (> 3*10^4 cm-3) core nucleus. To substantiate this picture, we
compare our results with observations in dust emission at 1.2 mm and in two
transitions of C18O. We find a good correlation between deuterium fractionation
and N(C18O)/N(H2) for the nuclei of 14 starless cores. We, thus, identified a
set of properties that characterize the most evolved, or ""pre-stellar"",
starless cores. These are: higher N2H+ and N2D+ column densities, higher
N(N2D+)/N(N2H+), more pronounced CO depletion, broader N2H+ lines with infall
asymmetry, higher central H2 column densities and a more compact density
profile than in the average core. We conclude that this combination of
properties gives a reliable indication of the evolutionary state of the core.
Seven cores in our sample (L1521F, OphD, L429, L694, L183, L1544 and TMC2) show
the majority of these features and thus are believed to be closer to forming a
protostar than are the other members of our sample. Finally, we note that the
subsample of Taurus cores behaves more homogeneously than the total sample, an
indication that the external environment could play an important role in the
core evolution.

brighter than V=20, amounting to a billion stars, galaxies, quasars and solar
system objects. It will achieve an astrometric accuracy of 10muas at V=15 -
corresponding to a distance accuracy of 1% at 1kpc. With Gaia, tens of millions
of stars will have their distances measured to a few percent or better. This is
an improvement over Hipparcos by several orders of magnitude in the number of
objects, accuracy and limiting magnitude. Gaia will also measure radial
velocities for source brighter than V~17. To characterize the objects, each
object is observed in 15 medium and broad photometric bands with an onboard CCD
camera. With these capabilities, Gaia will make significant advances in a wide
range of astrophysical topics. These include a detailed kinematical map of
stellar populations, stellar structure and evolution, the discovery and
characterization of thousands of exoplanetary systems and General Relativity on
large scales. I give an overview of the mission, its operating principles and

astronomical image by a CCD camera is, in large part, Poissonian. One would
expect, therefore, that computational approaches that incorporate this a priori
information will be more effective than those that do not. The Richardson-Lucy
(RL) algorithm, for example, can be viewed as a maximum-likelihood (ML) method
for image deblurring when the data noise is assumed to be Poissonian.
Least-squares (LS) approaches, on the other hand, arises from the assumption
that the noise is Gaussian with fixed variance across pixels, which is rarely
accurate. Given this, it is surprising that in many cases results obtained
using LS techniques are relatively insensitive to whether the noise is
Poissonian or Gaussian. Furthermore, in the presence of Poisson noise, results
obtained using LS techniques are often comparable with those obtained by the RL
algorithm. We seek an explanation of these phenomena via an examination of the
regularization properties of particular LS algorithms. In addition, a careful
analysis of the RL algorithm yields an explanation as to why it is more
effective than LS approaches for star-like objects, and why it provides similar
reconstructions for extended objects. We finish with a convergence analysis of
the RL algorithm. Numerical results are presented throughout the paper. It is
important to stress that the subject treated in this paper is not academic. In
fact, in comparison with many ML algorithms, the LS algorithms are much easier
to use and to implement, often provide faster convergence rates, and are much
more flexible regarding the incorporation of constraints on the solution.
Consequently, if little to no improvement is gained in the use of an ML
approach over an LS algorithm, the latter will often be the preferred approach.

Because any dredge-up of CNO processed material to the surface may complicate
the interpretation of CNO abundances in giants, we have also measured the
surface abundance of lithium. Our sample shows a clear dichotomy between two
groups of stars. The first group shows evidence of C to N conversion through CN
cycling and strong Li dilution, a signature of mixing. The second group shows
no evidence for C to N conversion, and Li is only moderately diluted, and we
conclude that their C and N abundances are very close to those of the gas from
which they formed in the early Galaxy. These ""unmixed"" stars reflect the
abundances in the early Galaxy: the [C/Fe] ratio is constant (about +0.2 dex)
and the [C/Mg] ratio is close to solar at low metallicity, favouring a high C
production by massive zero-metal supernovae. The [N/Fe] and [N/Mg] ratios
scatter widely. The larger values of these ratios define a flat upper plateau
([N/Mg]= 0.0, [N/Fe]= +0.1), which could reflect higher values within a wide
range of yields of zero-metal Sne II. Alternatively, by analogy with the DLA's,
the lower abundances ([N/Mg]= -1.1, [N/Fe]= -0.7) could reflect generally low
yields from the first Sne II, the other stars being N enhanced by winds of
massive Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. At present it cannot be decided
whether primary N is produced primarily in SNe II or in massive AGB stars, or
in both. The stellar N abundances and [N/O] ratios are compatible with those
found in Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems.

and by this their star formation history is highlighted. Tidal torques and
accretion of satellites in principle provide enough angular momentum to form
disks with sizes that are in agreement with observations. However three major
problems have been identified that challenge cold dark matter theory and affect
models of galaxy evolution: (1) too much angular momentum is transferred from
the gas to the dark halos during infall, leading to disks with scale lengths
that are too small, (2) bulgeless disks require more specific angular momentum
than is generated cosmologically even if gas would not lose angular momentum
during infall, (3) gravitational torques and hierarchical merging produce a
specific angular momentum distribution that does not match the distribution
required to form exponential disks naturally; some gas has exceptionally high
angular momentum, leading to extended outer disks while another large gas
fraction will contain very little specific angular momentum and is expected to
fall into the galactic center, forming a massive and dominant bulge component.
Any self-consistent theory of galaxy formation will require to provide
solutions to these questions. Selective mass loss of low-angular-momentum gas
in an early phase of galaxy evolution currently seems to be the most promising
scenario. Such a process would have a strong affect on the early protogalactic
evolution phase, the origin and evolution of galactic morphologies and link
central properties of galaxies like the origin of central massive black holes

accretion rate at the present time. However, at a radial distance of a fraction
of a parsec from Sgr A*, two rings populated by young massive stars suggest a
recent burst of star formation in a rather hostile environment. Here we explore
two ways of creating such young stellar rings with a gaseous accretion disk: by
self-gravity in a massive disk, and by capturing ""old"" low mass stars and
growing them via gas accretion in a disk. The minimum disk mass is above 10^4
Msun for the first mechanism and is few tens times larger for the second one.
The observed relatively small velocity dispersion of the stars rules out disks
more massive than around 10^5 Msun: heavier stellar or gas disks would warp
each other by orbital precession in an axisymmetric potential too strongly. The
capture of ""old"" stars by a disk is thus unlikely as the origin of the young
stellar disks. The absence of a massive nuclear gas disk in Sgr A* now implies
that the disk was either accreted by the SMBH, which would then imply almost a
quasar-like luminosity for Sgr A*, or was consumed in the star formation
episode. The latter possibility appears to be more likely on theoretical
grounds. We also consider whether accretion disk plane changes, expected to
occur due to fluctuations in the angular momentum of gas infalling into the
central parsec of a galaxy, would dislodge the embedded stars from the disk
midplane. We find that the stars leave the disk midplane only if the disk
orientation changes on time scales much shorter than the disk viscous time.

straightforward and we come to a supermatrix sigma-model containing an

one, although the interaction term has a different form. We study the model
making perturbation theory and renormalization group calculations. We check the

where strong electron-phonon coupling as well as the moderate magnetic
fluctuations coexist. By analyzing the strong coupling Eliashberg equation, we
find that s-wave superconducting gap function owing to the electron-phonon
coupling becomes highly anisotropic as the magnetic fluctuations increases. The
set of model parameters for realizing the strong gap anisotropy in the present
model will be appropriate for (Y,Lu)Ni$_2$B$_2$C. According to the present
mechanism, (groups of) pair of gap minima appear at points on the Fermi surface

function has appeared in a number of seemingly unrelated problems, mostly in
computer science and graph theory. In this paper, we show that this
distribution also appears in a rather well studied physical system, namely the
fluctuating interfaces. We present an exact solution for the distribution
P(h_m,L) of the maximal height h_m (measured with respect to the average
spatial height) in the steady state of a fluctuating interface in a one
dimensional system of size L with both periodic and free boundary conditions.
For the periodic case, we show that P(h_m,L)=L^{-1/2}f(h_m L^{-1/2}) for all L
where the function f(x) is the Airy distribution function. This result is valid
for both the Edwards-Wilkinson and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interfaces. For the
free boundary case, the same scaling holds P(h_m,L)=L^{-1/2}F(h_m L^{-1/2}),
but the scaling function F(x) is different from that of the periodic case. We
compute this scaling function explicitly for the Edwards-Wilkinson interface
and call it the F-Airy distribution function. Numerical simulations are in
excellent agreement with our analytical results. Our results provide a rather
rare exactly solvable case for the distribution of extremum of a set of
strongly correlated random variables. Some of these results were announced in a

functional of a polytropic star is similar to Tsallis free energy and the
H-function associated with a stellar polytrope is similar to Tsallis entropy.
More generally, the energy functional of a barotropic star is similar to a
generalized free energy and the H-function associated with a spherical stellar
system is similar to a generalized entropy. Their optimization under
appropriate constraints determines a condition of nonlinear dynamical
stability, not a condition of thermodynamical stability. The criterion of
dynamical stability for barotropic stars described by the Euler-Poisson system
is similar to a condition of canonical stability and the criterion of dynamical
stability for collisionless stellar systems described by the Vlasov-Poisson
system is similar to a condition of microcanonical stability. Hence, stellar
systems are stable whenever corresponding barotropic stars are stable but the
converse is wrong in general. This provides a new interpretation of Antonov
first law in terms of ensemble inequivalence. In this context, Tsallis
functional is not a true entropy or a true free energy. This is a useful
H-function making the bridge between polytropic and isothermal distributions. A
thermodynamical analogy can be developed to investigate the nonlinear dynamical
stability problem but the notions of entropy, free energy and temperature are

a serious tilt instability, in which symmetric tilts of the mirrors of an arm
cavity cause the cavity's light beam to slide sideways, so its radiation
pressure exerts a torque that increases the tilt. Sidles and Sigg showed that
the strength T of this torque is 26.2 times greater for advanced LIGO's
baseline cavities -- nearly flat spherical mirrors which support Gaussian beams
(``FG'' cavities), than for nearly concentric spherical mirrors which support
Gaussian beams with the same diffraction losses as the baseline case -- ``CG''
cavities: T^{FG}/T^{CG} = 26.2. This has motivated a proposal to change the
baseline design to nearly concentric, spherical mirrors. In order to reduce
thermoelastic noise in advanced LIGO, O'Shaughnessy and Thorne have proposed
replacing the spherical mirrors and their Gaussian beams by ``Mexican-Hat''
(MH) shaped mirrors which support flat-topped, ``mesa'' shaped beams. In this
paper we compute the tilt-instability torque for advanced-LIGO cavities with
nearly flat MH mirrors and mesa beams (``FM'' cavities) and nearly concentric
MH mirrors and mesa beams (``CM'' cavities), with the same diffraction losses
as in the baseline FG case. We find that the relative sizes of the restoring
torques are T^{CM}/T^{CG} = 0.91, T^{FM}/T^{CG} = 96, T^{FM}/T^{FG} = 3.67.
Thus, the nearly concentric MH mirrors have a weaker tilt instability than any
other configuration. Their thermoelastic noise is the same as for nearly flat
MH mirrors, and is much lower than for spherical mirrors.

are based on density functional theory, which is known to predict the
properties of high-pressure iron with good accuracy. The temperature dependence
of c/a is determined by minimising the Helmholtz free energy at fixed volume
and temperature, with thermal contributions due to lattice vibrations
calculated using harmonic theory. Anharmonic corrections to the harmonic
predictions are estimated from calculations of the thermal average stress
obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of hcp iron at the

with temperature. This increase is much smaller than found in earlier

in which the Hamiltonian operator components carry explicit time dependence
which is not under the control of an external agent. We consider the general
situation in which the state moves in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, a
drift term is present, and the operators driving the state evolution may be
unbounded. However, considerations are restricted by the assumption that there
exists an analytic domain, dense in the state space, on which solutions of the
controlled Schrodinger equation may be expressed globally in exponential form.
The issue of controllability then naturally focuses on the ability to steer the
quantum state on a finite-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere in Hilbert
space -- and thus on analytic controllability. A relatively straightforward
strategy allows the extension of Lie-algebraic conditions for strong analytic
controllability derived earlier for the simpler, time-independent system in
which the drift Hamiltonian and the interaction Hamiltonia have no intrinsic
time dependence. Enlarging the state space by one dimension corresponding to
the time variable, we construct an augmented control system that can be treated
as time-independent. Methods developed by Kunita can then be implemented to
establish controllability conditions for the one-dimension-reduced system
defined by the original time-dependent Schrodinger control problem. The
applicability of the resulting theorem is illustrated with selected examples.

  references, 3 f",,,,"quant-ph math.CO",,"  We treat the problem of normally ordering expressions involving the standard
boson operators a, a* where [a,a*]=1. We show that a simple product formula for
formal power series - essentially an extension of the Taylor expansion - leads
to a double exponential formula which enables a powerful graphical description
of the generating functions of the combinatorial sequences associated with such
functions - in essence, a combinatorial field theory. We apply these techniques
to some examples related to specific physical Hamiltonians.

entanglement (E) in comparison to concurrence (C) and negativity (N) is
studied. Analytical examples of states consistently and inconsistently ordered
by the entanglement measures are given. In particular, the states for which any
of the three measures imposes order opposite to that given by the other two
measures are described. Moreover, examples are given of pairs of the states,
for which (i) N'=N'' and C'=C'' but E' is different from E'', (ii) N'=N'' and
E'=E'' but C' differs from C'', (iii) E'=E'', N'<N'' and C'>C'', or (iv) states
having the same E, C, and N but still violating the
Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality to different degrees.
