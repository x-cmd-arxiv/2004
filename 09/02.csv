amount of mass loss from the progenitor star and the star's radius: red
supergiant stars with most of the H envelope intact (SN IIP), stars with some H
but most lost (IIL, IIb), stars with all H lost (Ib, Ic), and blue supergiant
stars with a massive H envelope (SN 1987A-like). Various aspects of the
immediate aftermath of the supernova are expected to develop in different ways
depending on the supernova category: mixing in the supernova, fallback on the
central compact object, expansion of any pulsar wind nebula, interaction with
circumstellar matter, and photoionization by shock breakout radiation. The
observed properties of young supernova remnants allow many of them to be placed
in one of the supernova categories; all the categories are represented except
for the SN 1987A-like type. Of the remnants with central pulsars, the pulsar
properties do not appear to be related to the supernova category. There is no
evidence that the supernova categories form a mass sequence, as would be
expected in a single star scenario for the evolution. Models for young pulsar
wind nebulae expanding into supernova ejecta indicate initial pulsar periods of
10-100 ms and approximate equipartition between particle and magnetic energies.
Ages are obtained for pulsar nebulae, including an age of 2400 pm 500 yr for
3C58, which is not consistent with an origin in SN 1181. There is no evidence
that mass fallback plays a role in neutron star properties.

At a radius R=474' the main sequence is well populated from the oldest turnoff
at I=21.5 to the 2.5 Gyr turnoff at I=19.5. Beyond this radius, a relatively
strong gradient in the density of stars with ages in the 2.5-4 Gyr range is
apparent. There are some stars brighter and bluer than the main population,
quite uniformly distributed over the whole area surveyed, which are well
matched by a 1.5 Gyr isochrone and may be indicative of a relatively recent

as some have claimed, a large portion of their redshift must be intrinsic
(non-Doppler). If these intrinsic components have preferred values, redshifts
will tend to cluster around these preferred values and produce peaks in the
redshift distribution. Doppler ejection and Hubble flow components will broaden
each peak. Because ejection velocities are randomly directed and Hubble flow
components are always positive, in this model all peaks are expected to show an
asymmetry, extending further out in the red wing. If peaks are present showing
this predicted asymmetry, it can lead directly to an estimate of quasar
distances. Using two quasar samples, one with high redshifts and one with low,
it is shown here that not only do all peaks in these two redshift distributions
occur at previously predicted preferred values, they also all show the
predicted extra extension in the red wing. For the low and high redshift
samples the mean cosmological components are found to be z$_{c} \sim 0.024$ and
$\sim 0.066$, respectively. The difference can be explained by the improved
detection limit of the high redshift sample. These results offer further
evidence in favor of the model proposing that QSOs are ejected from active

reasonable power spectra, density fluctuations from large-scale structure
produce > 100% errors in cosmological parameters derived from any single

(2003) which includes the effects of radiative cooling on the X-ray synchrotron
emission from core dominated jets and outflows. We derive the scaling relations
between the radio luminosity L_r, the synchrotron X-ray luminosity L_x, the
mass M, and the accretion rate of an accreting black hole. We argue that the
inclusion of synchrotron losses into the scaling relations is required by the
data used in Merloni, Heinz, & DiMatteo (2003) to define the ""fundamental
plane'' correlation between L_r, L_x, and M in AGNs and Galactic X-ray
binaries. We then fit the new scaling relations to the ""fundamental plane""
correlation. This allows us to derive statistical constraints on the
contribution from jet synchrotron emission to the X-rays from black holes, or,
alternatively, on the particle acceleration scheme at work in these jets. We
find that, in order for jet synchrotron X-rays to be consistent with the
observed ""fundamental plane"" correlation, the global particle spectrum must be
both steep: f(gamma) ~ gamma^(-(3.4 (+0.6-0.5)), and unbroken down to energies
well below the radio synchrotron regime. Such a steep particle distribution
would imply steeper X-ray spectra than observed in most sources contributing to
the correlation with avalailable X-ray spectral index measurements. We suggest
that, unless some assumptions of the scale invariance hypothesis are broken,
another emission mechanism (likely either disk radiation and/or inverse Compton
scattering in the jet) contributes significantly to the X-rays of a sizeable
fraction of the sources.

galaxies. The circumnuclear H alpha emission, within a radius of two kpc, is
often patchy in late-type, and absent or in the form of a nuclear ring in
early-type galaxies. There is no clear correlation of nuclear or circumnuclear
H alpha morphology with the presence or absence of a bar in the host galaxy,
except for the nuclear rings which occur in barred hosts. The presence or
absence of close bright companion galaxies does not affect the circumnuclear H
alpha morphology, but their presence does correlate with a higher fraction of
nuclear H alpha peaks. Nuclear rings occur in at least 21% (+-5%) of spiral
galaxies, and occur predominantly in galaxies also hosting an AGN. Only two of

self-consistently solve for the flux coming from the deep crust and core. The
temperature where the carbon unstably ignites is only weakly sensitive to the
composition of the ashes of H/He burning, but does depend on the thermal
conductivity of the inner crust and the neutrino emissivity of the core. The
observed superburst recurrence times and energetics suggest that the crust
thermal conductivity is low, as if the crust were amorphous instead of
crystalline. If the conductivity is higher, such as from a lattice with
impurities, then matching the superburst properties require that the neutrino
emissivity be not stronger than modified Urca. Observations of
superbursts-energetics, recurrence times, and cooling times-therefore
complement observations of isolated cooling neutron stars and soft X-ray

phenomena may be associated with most core collapses, the neutrino-driven
supernova itself and an underenergetic jet-like ejection that follows. The
latter may be a magnetic wind that easily penetrates the debris created by the
much more energetic supernova. We predict that many core-collapse supernova
remnants should have sub-dominant jet-like features. In Cas A, we associate
this sub-dominant collimated wind with the ""jet/counter-jet"" structure
observed. We suggest that the actual Cas A explosion itself is at nearly right
angles to this jet, along a rotation axis that coincides with the bulk of the
ejecta, the iron lobes, and the putative direction of motion of the point
source. It may be that when rotation becomes sufficiently rapid that the
strong-neutrino-driven-supernova/weak-jet duality switches to a strong-MHD-jet
scenario that might be associated with hypernovae, and in some cases GRBs.
Finally, we present a calculation using a new 2D multi-group, flux-limited
radiation/hydrodynamics code we have recently developed for the simulation of
core-collapse supernovae. We discuss the rotation-induced anisotropy in the

addition of these supernovae to the relationship between the near-infrared

independent of the decline rate parameter. (SN 1991bg, the prototype of the

dispersion in the Hubble diagram in JHK is only ~0.15 mag. The near-infrared
properties of Type Ia supernovae continue to be excellent measures of the
luminosity distances to the supernova host galaxies, due to the need for only
small corrections from the epoch of observation to maximum light, low
dispersion in absolute magnitudes at maximum light, and the minimal reddening
effects in the near-infrared.

proposed for culling galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 in K-selected samples and
classifying them as star-forming or passive systems. The method is calibrated
on the highly complete spectroscopic redshift database of the K20 survey,
verified with simulations and tested on other datasets. Requiring
BzK=(z-K)-(B-z)>-0.2 (AB) allows to select actively star-forming galaxies at
z>1.4, independently on their dust reddening. Instead, objects with BzK<-0.2
and (z-K)>2.5 (AB) colors include passively evolving galaxies at z>1.4, often
with spheroidal morphologies. Simple recipes to estimate the reddening, SFRs
and masses of BzK-selected galaxies are derived, and calibrated on K<20
galaxies. Based on their UV (reddening-corrected), X-ray and radio
luminosities, the BzK-selected star-forming galaxies with K<20 turn out to have
average SFR ~ 200 Msun yr^-1, and median reddening E(B-V)~0.4. Besides missing
the passively evolving galaxies, the UV selection appears to miss some relevant
fraction of the z~2 star-forming galaxies with K<20, and hence of the
(obscured) star-formation rate density at this redshift. The high SFRs and
masses add to other existing evidence that these z=2 star-forming galaxies may
be among the precursors of z=0 early-type galaxies. Theoretical models cannot
reproduce simultaneously the space density of both passively evolving and
highly star-forming galaxies at z=2. In view of Spitzer Space Telescope
observations, an analogous technique based on the RJL photometry is proposed to
complement the BzK selection and to identify massive galaxies at 2.5<z<4.0.
These color criteria should help in completing the census of the stellar mass
and of the star-formation rate density at high redshift (abridged).

build-up of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) in the nuclei of galaxies, based on
observations of the evolving radio and (hard) X-ray luminosity functions of
AGN. The fundamental plane of black hole activity discovered by Merloni, Heinz
& Di Matteo (2003) is used as a mass and accretion rate estimator. I adopt the
local BH mass function as a boundary condition to integrate backwards in time
the continuity equation for the SMBH evolution, neglecting the role of mergers.
Under the most general assumption that accretion proceeds in a radiatively
efficient way above a certain rate, and in a radiatively inefficient way below,
the redshift evolution of the mass and accretion rate functions are calculated
self-consistently. The only tunable parameters are the accretion efficiency and
the critical ratio of the X-ray to Eddington luminosity at which the transition
between accretion modes takes place. The evolution of the BH mass function
between z=0 and z ~ 3 shows clear signs of an anti-hierarchical behaviour:
while the majority of the most massive objects (M > 10^9) were already in place
at z ~ 3, lower mass ones mainly grew at progressively lower redshift. As an
example, I will discuss the consequences of these results for the lifetimes of
accreting black holes.

probed by ASCA, are included. All sources exhibit stronger X-ray variability
towards longer time scales, but the increase is greater for relatively higher
luminosity sources. Variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with X-ray
luminosity and black hole mass, but amplitudes saturate and become independent
of luminosity or black hole mass towards the longest time scales. The data are
consistent with the models of power spectral density (PSD) movement described
in Markowitz et al. (2003a) and McHardy et al. (2004), whereby Seyfert 1
galaxies' variability can be described by a single, universal PSD shape whose
break frequency scales with black hole mass. The best-fitting scaling relations
between variability time scale, black hole mass and X-ray luminosity imply an
average accretion rate of ~5% of the Eddington limit for the sample. Nearly all
sources exhibit stronger variability in the relatively soft 2-4 keV band

from both the traditional polar cap and outer gap models, but combines elements
of each. The slot gap model is based on electron acceleration along the edge of

Along the last open field line, the pair formation front rises to very high
altitude forming a slot gap, where the accelerating electric field is
unscreened by pairs. The resulting radiation features both hollow cones from
the lower-altitude pair cascades, seen at small viewing angles, as well as
caustic emission on the trailing-edge field lines at high altitude, seen from
both poles at large viewing angle. The combination of the small solid angle of
slot gap emission (<< 1 sr) with a high probability of viewing the emission
predicts that more gamma-ray pulsars could be detected at larger distances. In
this picture, many of the positional coincidences of radio pulsars with
unidentified EGRET sources become plausible as real associations, as the flux
predicted by the slot gap model for many of the pulsars would provide the
observed EGRET source flux. The expected probability of seeing radio-quiet

importance - its average convergence will exactly compensate the divergence
within (b). The net effect on the light is statistically the same as if all the
matter in (a) is `fully homogenized'. When applying the above ideas towards
understanding the angular size of the primary acoustic peaks of the microwave
background, however, caution is needed. The reason is that most (by mass) of
(a) are in galaxies - their full mass profiles are not sampled by passing light
- at least the inner 20 kpc regions of these systems are missed by the majority
of rays, while the rest of the rays would map back to unresolvable but
magnified, randomly located spots to compensate for the loss in angular size.
Therefore, a scanning pair of WMAP beams finds most frequently that the largest
temperature difference occurs when each beam is placed at diametrically
opposite points of the Dyer-Roeder collapsed sections. This is the {\it mode}
magnification, which corresponds to the acoustic {\it peaks}, and is less than
the mean (or the homogeneous pre-clumping angular size). Since space was seen
to be Euclidean without taking the said adjustment into account, the true

(Kerr) Black Hole (BH) with finite mass in order that the generic properties
associated with the symmetries of stationary axisymmetric Einstein equations
are obeyed, i.e, in order to have m\ge 0, we must have $a=0$. In other words,
all observed chargeless BHs with finite masses must be non-rotating
Schwarzschild BHs. Here, by comparing the invariant 4 volume associated with
original Kerr metric [2] with the Boyer-Lindquist version of the same [3], we
further find that, stationary axisymmetric {\em vacuum} Einstein solutions
actually correspond to m=0 in addition to a=0! This means that if the Kerr
solution is a unique one, the Schwarzschild BHs too correspond to only m=0 and
therefore the observed BH candidates (BHs) with m >0 are not BHs at all. This
is in agreement some detailed analysis of recent observations[4-7] which
suggest the the BHCs have strong intrinsic magnetic moment rather than any
Event Horizon. If one would derive the Boyer-Lindquist metric in a
straightforward manner by using the Backlund transformation, it would follow
that a= m sin phi, where phi is the azimuth angle. This relationship directly
confirms the result that for a supposed rotating BH, actually, both a=m=0.

the effects of non-local disorder correlations (alloy short-range order) on the

original Anderson disorder problem to that of a selfconsistently embedded
cluster. This cluster problem is then solved using the equations of motion
technique. The CPA is recovered for cluster size $N_{c}=1$, and the disorder
averaged density-of-states (DOS) is always positive definite. Various new
features, compared to those observed in CPA, and related to repeated scattering
on pairs of sites, reflecting the effect of SRO are clearly visible in the DOS.
It is explicitly shown that the cluster-CPA method always yields
positive-definite DOS. Anderson localization effects have been investigated
within this approach. In general, we find that Anderson localization sets in

allows reasoning with information which is hierarchically structured and forms
a (suitable) domain. We extend this framework to include reasoning with default
negation, giving rise to a new nonmonotonic reasoning framework on hierarchical
knowledge which encompasses answer set programming with extended disjunctive
logic programs. We also show that the hierarchically structured knowledge on
which programming in this paradigm can be done, arises very naturally from
formal concept analysis. Together, we obtain a default reasoning paradigm for
conceptual knowledge which is in accordance with mainstream developments in
nonmonotonic reasoning.

on the latter type of uncertainty, and suggest the use of statistical geometry

nuclei will be an important source for LISA, the space-based gravitational-wave
(GW) detector. However, a large fraction of captures will not be individually
resolvable--either because they are too distant, have unfavorable orientation,
or have too many years to go before final plunge--and so will constitute a
source of ``confusion noise,'' obscuring other types of sources. Here we
estimate the shape and overall magnitude of the spectrum of confusion noise
from CO captures. The overall magnitude depends on the capture rates, which are
rather uncertain, so we present results for a plausible range of rates. We show
that the impact of capture confusion noise on the total LISA noise curve ranges
from insignificant to modest, depending on these rates. Capture rates at the
high end of estimated ranges would raise LISA's overall (effective) noise level
by at most a factor \sim 2. While this slightly elevated noise level would
somewhat decrease LISA's sensitivity to other classes of sources, overall, this
would be a pleasant problem for LISA to have: It would also imply that
detection rates for CO captures were at nearly their maximum possible levels
(given LISA's baseline design). This paper includes several other results that
should be useful in further studies of LISA capture sources, including (i) a
calculation of the total GW energy output from generic inspirals into Kerr
MBHs, and (ii) an approximate GW energy spectrum for a typical capture.

is relatively independent of the droplet size. It increases with an increase in
the width of the spatial distribution and the collective-expansion velocity of
the droplets. As a result, the value of $R_{out}$ can lie close to $R_{side}$

calculation in F allows us to apply the SW map, reducing the maximal abelian
point of view to a minimal nonabelian point of view (replacing 1/F with [X,X]
at large F), resulting in matrix model equations of motion. We first study
derivative corrections to the abelian BI action and compute the 2-loop beta
function for an open string in a WZW (parallelizable) background. This beta
function is the first step in the process of computing string equations of
motion, which can be later obtained by computing the Weyl anomaly coefficients
or the partition function. The beta function is exact in F and computed to
orders O(H,H^2,H^3) (H=dB and curvature is R ~ H^2) and O(DF,D^2F,D^3F). In
order to carry out this calculation we develop a new regularization method for
2-loop graphs. We then relate perturbative results for abelian and nonabelian
BI actions, by showing how abelian derivative corrections yield nonabelian
commutator corrections, at large F. We begin the construction of a matrix model
describing \a' corrections to Myers' dielectric effect. This construction is
carried out by setting up a perturbative classification of the relevant
nonabelian tensor structures, which can be considerably narrowed down by the
constraint of translation invariance in the action and the possibility for
generic field redefinitions. The final matrix action is not uniquely determined
and depends upon two free parameters. These parameters could be computed via
further calculations in the abelian theory.

integrable in the sense of Adler and van Moerbeke. This also follows, in a
quite different way, from Chaplygin's integration in terms of hyperelliptic

using a linear simulation for the rotating disc situation. The accepted formula

everywhere a local standard of absolutely zero rotation. It is then concluded
that the field off all possible space-time null geodesics or photon paths unify

universal standard of absolute local rotation rate related to the apparent
rotation of the celestial sphere. However this apparent rotation is actually

the terrestrial magnetic field due to the presence of the solar wind. By
comparing with experimental observations, we have found that the geometrical
configuration of the magnetosphere, before, and after the magnetic field of the
Earth started to deviate the solar wind, has not changed notably, and that the
solar wind should have had a finite conductivity. This model can also be used
to perform linear stability analysis of fluid and magnetic instabilities.

are two-qubit mixed states for which the REE for some range of a fixed
negativity is higher than that for pure states. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
mixture of a pure entangled state and pure separable state orthogonal to it is
likely to give the maximal REE. By noting that the negativity is a measure of
entanglement cost under operations preserving positivity of partial transpose,
our results provide an explicit example of operations such that, even though
the entanglement cost for an exact preparation is the same, the entanglement of
distillation of a mixed state can exceed that of pure states. This means that
the entanglement manipulation via a pure state can result in a larger
entanglement loss than that via a mixed state.

  With Spontaneous Superposition Breaking","32 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Developing an earlier proposal (Ne'eman, Damnjanovic, etc), we show herein
that there is a Landau continuous phase transition from the exact quantum
dynamics to the effectively classical one, occurring via spontaneous
superposition breaking (effective hiding), as a special case of the
corresponding general formalism (Bernstein). Critical values of the order
parameters for this transition are determined by Heisenberg's indeterminacy
relations, change continuously, and are in excellent agreement with the recent
and remarkable experiments with Bose condensation. It is also shown that such a
phase transition can sucessfully model self-collapse (self-decoherence), as an
effective classical phenomenon, on the measurement device. This then induces a
relative collapse (relative decoherence) as an effective quantum phenomenon on
the measured quantum object by measurement.
  We demonstrate this (including the case of Bose-Einstein condensation) in the
well-known cases of the Stern-Gerlach spin measurement, Bell's inequality and
the recently discussed quantum superposition on a mirror a la Marshall et al.
These results provide for a proof that quantum mechanics, in distinction to all
absolute collapse and hidden-variable theories, is local and objective. There
now appear no insuperable obstacles to solving the open problems in quantum
theory of measurement and foundation of quantum mechanics, and strictly within
the standard quantum-mechanical formalism. Simply put, quantum mechanics is a
field theory over the Hilbert space, the classical mechanics characteristics of
which emerge through spontaneous superposition breaking.
