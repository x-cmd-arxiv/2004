approach to the static spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein equations is
based on a careful physical analysis of radial gauge conditions. It brings us
to a two parameter family of relativistic stars without stiff functional
dependence between the stelar radius and stelar mass.
  As a result, a point particle idealization -- a limiting case of bodies with
finite dimension, becomes possible in GR, much like in Newtonian gravity. We
devote this article to detailed mathematical study of this limit.

precision and high quality milliarcsec-resolution images by simultaneously
detecting calibrator sources near the target source. To reach these goals, we
suggest that the long-baseline component of SKA contains at least 25% of the
total collecting area in a region between 1000 to 5000 km from the core SKA. We
also suggest a minimum of 60 elements in the long-baseline component of SKA to
provide the necessary (u-v) coverage. For simultaneous all-sky observations,
which provide absolute astrometric and geodetic parameters, we suggest using
ten independent subarrays each composed of at least six long-baseline elements
correlated with the core SKA. We discuss many anticipated SKA long-baseline
astrometric experiments: determination of distance, proper motion and orbital
motion of thousands of stellar objects; planetary motion detections; mass
determination of degenerate stars using their kinetics; calibration of the
universal distance scale from 10 pc to 10 Mpc; the core and inner-jet
interactions of AGN. With an increase by a factor of 10 in absolute astrometric
accuracy using simultaneous all sky observations, the fundamental quasar
reference frame can be defined to <10 microarcsec and tied to the solar-system
dynamic frame to this accuracy. Parameters associated with the earth rotation
and orientation, nutation, and geophysical parameters, can be accurately
monitored. Tests of fundamental physics include: solar and Jovian deflection
experiments, the sky frame accuracy needed to interpret the gravity
wave/pulsar-timing experiment, accurate monitoring of spacecraft orbits which

orbital parameters are expressed as elementary functions of the observable
quantities such as the location of four observed points and the time interval
between these points. The key thing is that we use the time interval but not
the time of each observation in order to avoid treating the Kepler's equation.
The present formula can be applied even in cases where the observations cover a
short arc of the orbit during less than one period. Thus the formula will be
useful in the future astrometric missions such as SIM, GAIA and JASMINE.

temperature of clusters obtained from X-ray observations is always lower than
the emission-weighed temperature. This bias is related to the fact that the
emission-weighted temperature does not reflect the actual spectral properties

structures in clusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, like
shock fronts, are present. In real observations shock fronts appear much weaker

fusion, affects strongly the central rapidity region but only slightly the

modestly the profile of shower maximum but broadens considerably the number
distribution of muons at ground. For the latter mechanism, the development of

number of muons at ground is lowered, resembling a shower generated by a

considering that the galactic baryonic mass is likely to consist not only from
the detected baryons, stars and gas, but also from a dark baryonic component
proportional to the HI gas. The BTF relation is optimally improved when the HI
mass is multiplied by a factor of about 3, but larger factors up to 11-16 still
improve the fit over the original one using only the detected baryons. The
strength of this improved relation is quantified with up-to-date statistical
tests such as the Akaike Information Criterion or the Bayesian Information
Criterion. In particular they allow to show that supposing a variable
$M_\star/L$ ratio instead is much less significant. This result reinforces the
suggestion made in several recent works that mass within galactic disks must be
a multiple of the HI mass, and that galactic disks are substantially, but not

attention is paid to the problem of estimating the position angle of the major

derived circular rotation velocity. We discuss and compare different methods of

into account the presence of regular velocity (brightness) perturbations caused
by spiral density waves. It is shown that the commonly used method of tilted
rings may lead to systematic errors in the estimation of orientation parameters

ionized gas, and the mean rotation curves in the frame of a model of pure

digitally stacked eight 1-hour R-band Tech Pan films from the UK Schmidt

isophotal limit of 26.5 R mag/sq. arcsec. At this level, we find that all of

generates shifts in the key epochs for structure formation, which proceeds in
the mirror sector under different conditions. We consider adiabatic scalar
primordial perturbations as an input and analyze the trends of all the relevant
scales for structure formation (Jeans length and mass, Silk scale, horizon
scale) for both ordinary and mirror sectors, comparing them with the CDM case.
These scales are functions of the fundamental parameters of the theory (the
temperature of the mirror plasma and the amount of mirror baryonic matter), and
in particular they are influenced by the difference between the cosmological
key epochs in the two sectors. Then we used a numerical code to compute the
evolution in linear regime of density perturbations for all the components of a
Mirror Universe: ordinary baryons and photons, mirror baryons and photons, and
possibly cold dark matter. We analyzed the evolution of the perturbations for
different values of mirror temperature and baryonic density, and obtained that
for x=T'/T less than a typical value x_eq, for which the mirror baryon-photon
decoupling happens before the matter-radiation equality, mirror baryons are
equivalent to the CDM for the linear structure formation process. Indeed, the
smaller the value of x, the closer mirror dark matter resembles standard cold
dark matter during the linear regime.

the emission in the optical passbands. The new dwarf companion candidates
generally contain blue star-forming regions. The drift of optical isophotes
together with the warping of HI isophotes outside the optical image of regular

world has the same microphysics as the observable one and couples the latter
only gravitationally. The primordial nucleosynthesis bounds demand that the
mirror sector should have a smaller temperature T' than the ordinary one T, and
by this reason its evolution can be substantially deviated from the standard
cosmology. In this paper we took scalar adiabatic perturbations as the input in
a flat Universe, and computed the power spectra for ordinary and mirror CMB and
LSS, changing the cosmological parameters, and always comparing with the CDM
case. We found differences in both the CMB and LSS power spectra, and we
demonstrated that the LSS spectrum is particularly sensitive to the mirror
parameters, due to the presence of both the oscillatory features of mirror
baryons and the collisional mirror Silk damping. For x<0.3 the mirror
baryon-photon decoupling happens before the matter-radiation equality, so that
CMB and LSS power spectra in linear regime are equivalent for mirror and CDM
cases. For higher x-values the LSS spectra strongly depend on the amount of
mirror baryons. Finally, qualitatively comparing with the present observational
limits on the CMB and LSS spectra, we show that for x<0.3 the entire dark
matter could be made of mirror baryons, while in the case x>0.3 the pattern of
the LSS power spectrum excludes the possibility of dark matter consisting
entirely of mirror baryons, but they could present as admixture (up to 50%) to
the conventional CDM.

on constraints which are used to represent (potentially infinite) sets of
states. A general powerful technique which can be employed for proving
termination of these algorithms is that of well quasi-orderings. Several
methodologies have been proposed for derivation of new well quasi-ordered
constraint systems. However, many of these constraint systems suffer from a
""constraint explosion problem"", as the number of the generated constraints
grows exponentially with the size of the problem. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a refinement of the theory of well quasi-orderings, called the theory of
better quasi-orderings, is more appropriate for symbolic model checking, since
it allows inventing constraint systems which are both well quasi-ordered and
compact. As a main application, we introduce existential zones, a constraint
system for verification of systems with unboundedly many clocks and use our
methodology to prove that existential zones are better quasi-ordered. We show
how to use existential zones in verification of timed Petri nets and present
some experimental results. Also, we apply our methodology to derive new
constraint systems for verification of broadcast protocols, lossy channel
systems, and integral relational automata. The new constraint systems are
exponentially more succinct than existing ones, and their well quasi-ordering
cannot be shown by previous methods in the literature.

proceeding via the hadronic content of the photon. For SM Higgs masses of
current theoretical interest, the resolved photon contributions are
non-negligible in precision cross section measurements. We found that
production of the heavier Higgs bosons H^0 and A^0 of the MSSM can probe
regions of the SUSY parameter space that will complement other measurements.
Finally, we showed that associated t H^\pm production in gamma-gamma collisions
can be used to make an accurate determination of tan(beta) for low and high
tan(beta)by precision measurements of the gamma gamma to H^\pm t +X cross
section.

  (2005) 233-262",,,"math.RA math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extension B\subset A of algebras over a commutative ring k is an
H-extension for an L-bialgebroid H if A is an H-comodule algebra and B is the
subalgebra of its coinvariants. It is H-Galois if the canonical map A\otimes_B
A\to A\otimes_L H is an isomorphism or, equivalently, if the canonical coring
(A\otimes_L H:A) is a Galois coring.
  In the case of a Hopf algebroid H=(H_L,H_R,S) any H_R-extension is shown to
be also an H_L-extension. If the antipode is bijective then also the notions of
H_R-Galois extensions and of H_L-Galois extensions are proven to coincide.
  Results about bijective entwining structures are extended to entwining
structures over non-commutative algebras in order to prove a Kreimer-Takeuchi
type theorem for a finitely generated projective Hopf algebroid H with
bijective antipode. It states that any H-Galois extension B\subset A is
projective, and if A is k-flat then already the surjectivity of the canonical
map implies the Galois property.
  The Morita theory, developed for corings by Caenepeel, Vercruysse and Wang,
is applied to obtain equivalent criteria for the Galois property of Hopf
algebroid extensions. This leads to Hopf algebroid analogues of results for
Hopf algebra extensions by Doi and, in the case of Frobenius Hopf algebroids,
by Cohen, Fishman and Montgomery.

For this reason, we will introduce two distinct notions of invertibility in the
semistar setting (called $\star$--invertibility and
quasi--$\star$--invertibility), we will discuss the motivations of these ``two

This study follows a similarly structured analysis on an uncoupled version of

perturbation to the initial equilibrium is characterized by the total radiative
forcing realized, by the rate of increase, and by the North-South asymmetry.
The choice of suitably defined metrics allows us to determine the boundary
dividing the set of radiative forcing scenarios that lead the system to
equilibria characterized by a THC pattern similar to the present one, from
those that drive the system to equilibria where the THC is reversed. We also
consider different choices for the atmospheric transport parameterizations and
for the ratio between the high latitude to tropical radiative forcing. We
generally find that fast forcings are more effective than slow forcings in
disrupting the present THC pattern, forcings that are stronger in the northern
box are also more effective in destabilizing the system, and that very slow
forcings do not destabilize the system whatever their asymmetry, unless the
radiative forcings are very asymmetric and the atmospheric transport is a
relatively weak function of the meridional temperature gradient. The changes in
the strength of the THC are primarily forced by changes in the latent heat
transport in the hemisphere, because of its sensitivity to temperature that
arises from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.

ensuing concept of dynamic complexity (and related intrinsic chaoticity) is
absolutely universal and can be applied to the problem of (natural and

with classical behaviour emergence from quantum states at the lowest levels of
complex world dynamics. We show that the main properties of this dynamically
emerging consciousness (and intelligence, at the preceding complexity level)
correspond to empirically derived properties of natural consciousness and
obtain causally substantiated conclusions about their artificial realisation,
including the fundamentally justified paradigm of genuine machine
consciousness. This rigorously defined machine consciousness is different from
both natural consciousness and any mechanistic, dynamically single-valued

representation of protein folds based on simple observables defined as
frequencies of oriented cycles in contact graphs. Motivated by the idea that
these cycles may form a code of the entire protein structure we investigate its
Shannon entropy. The latter shows a characteristic transitory behavior when
traced over different values of the geometric threshold $t$ which defines
protein residues in contact. To account for this observation, we propose a
non-linear mechanical model-- formulated as a Hamiltonian system in which $t$
is regarded as a continuous parameter-- that allows to identify the behavior of
the Shannon entropy as a first-order phase transition between a disordered and
an ordered phase of the proposed mechanical system. The transition itself
reflects the formation of protein structure when represented in terms of
contact graph cycles, and it is identified as an example of a fragmentation
transition known from several other statistical systems without a proper
thermodynamic limit. Some interesting implications follow from our model
including chirality, broken $t$-symmetry and one-dimensionality. Although
defined from purely structural considerations, we further show that for native
protein structures these observables follow some of the quantitative rules that
are typically valid for amino acid types in protein sequences. Moreover, this
relation between polypeptide structures and their amino acid sequences suggests
a specific protein design alphabet.

eigenstates of large-area, current-biased Josephson junctions, manipulated and
measured using strobed external circuitry. Two or more of these phase qubits
are capacitively coupled to a high-quality-factor piezoelectric
nanoelectromechanical disk resonator, which forms the backbone of our
architecture, and which enables coherent coupling of the qubits. The integrated
system is analogous to one or more few-level atoms (the Josephson junction
qubits) in an electromagnetic cavity (the nanomechanical resonator). However,
unlike existing approaches using atoms in electromagnetic cavities, here we can
individually tune the level spacing of the ``atoms'' and control their
``electromagnetic'' interaction strength. We show theoretically that quantum
states prepared in a Josephson junction can be passed to the nanomechanical
resonator and stored there, and then can be passed back to the original
junction or transferred to another with high fidelity. The resonator can also
be used to produce maximally entangled Bell states between a pair of Josephson
junctions. Many such junction-resonator complexes can assembled in a
hub-and-spoke layout, resulting in a large-scale quantum circuit. Our proposed

bases (MUBs) in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, d being a power of a prime, as
an analogue of an arc in a (Desarguesian) projective plane of order d. Complete
sets of MUBs thus correspond to (d+1)-arcs, i.e., ovals. The existence of two
principally distinct kinds of ovals for d even and greater than four, viz.
conics and non-conics, implies the existence of two qualitatively different
groups of the complete sets of MUBs for the Hilbert spaces of corresponding
dimensions.

nuclei fixed in a quantum dot. Under the approximately homogeneous condition
that we explicitly present in this paper, this many-particle system behaves as
a single mode boson interacting with the spin of a single conduction band
electron confined in this quantum dot. Within this effective spin-boson system,
the quantum information carried by the electronic spin can be coherently
transferred into the collective bosonic mode of excitation in the ensemble of
nuclei. In this sense, the collective bosonic excitation can serve as a stable
quantum memory to store the quantum information of spin state of electron.

established. Scaling to higher number of qubits is hindered by two major
requirements (i) mutual coupling among qubits and (ii) qubit addressability. It
has been demonstrated that mutual coupling can be increased by using residual
dipolar couplings among spins by orienting the spin system in a liquid
crystalline matrix. In such a case, the heteronuclear spins are weakly coupled
but the homonuclear spins become strongly coupled. In such circumstances, the
strongly coupled spins can no longer be treated as qubits. However, it has been
demonstrated elsewhere, that the $2^N$ energy levels of a strongly coupled N
spin-1/2 system can be treated as an N-qubit system. For this purpose the
various transitions have to be identified to well defined energy levels. This
paper consists of two parts. In the first part, the energy level diagram of a
heteronuclear 5-spin system is obtained by using a newly developed
heteronuclear z-cosy (HET-Z-COSY) experiment. In the second part,
implementation of logic gates, preparation of pseudopure states, creation of
entanglement and entanglement transfer is demonstrated, validating the use of
such systems for quantum information processing.
