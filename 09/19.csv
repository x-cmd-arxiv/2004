potentials. The model galaxies are composed of the three stellar components
(disk, bulge and bar) and two dark ones (supermassive black hole and halo)
whose gravitational potentials are assumed to be invariant in time in the frame
corotating with the bar. We found that the torques alone generated by the
moderately strong bar that gives the maximum of tangential-to-radial force
ratio as $(F_{Tan}/F_{Rad})_{max}= 0.3$ are not sufficient to drive the gas
particles close to the center due to the barrier imposed by the inner Lindblad
resonances (ILRs). In order to transport the gas particles towards the nucleus
($r<100$ pc), a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and high sound speed of
the gas are required to be present. The former is required to remove the inner
inner Lindblad resonance (IILR) that prevents gas inflow close to the nucleus,
while the latter provides favourable conditions for the gas particles to lose
their angular momentum and to spiral in. Our models that have no IILR show the
trailing nuclear spirals whose innermost parts reach close to the center in a
curling way when the gas sound speed is $ c_{s} \gtrsim 15$ km s$^{-1}$. They
resemble the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals observed in the central
kiloparsec of spiral galaxies. We found that the symmetric two-armed nuclear
spirals are formed by the hydrodynamic spiral shocks caused by the
gravitational torque of the bar in the presence of a central SMBH that can
remove IILR when the sound speed of gas is high enough to drive a large amount
of gas inflow deep inside the ILR. However, the detailed morphology of nuclear
spirals depends on the sound speed of gas.

(SNRs) occurs in all six objects where morphological measurements are presently
available in the hard X-ray continuum at several keV. For the three
archetypical objects (SN 1006, Cas A and Tycho's SNR) to which nonlinear
time-dependent acceleration theory has been successfully applied up to now, the
global theoretical and the local observational field strengths agree very well,
suggesting in addition that all young SNRs exhibit the amplification effect as
a result of very efficient acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays (CRs) at the
outer shock. Since this appears to be empirically the case, we may reverse the
argument and consider field amplification as a measure of nuclear CR
acceleration and it has indeed been argued that acceleration in the amplified
fields allows the CR spectrum from SNRs to reach the knee in the spectrum or,
in special objects, even beyond. The above results are furthermore used to
investigate the time evolution of field amplification in young SNRs. Although
the uncertainties in the data do not allow precise conclusions regarding this
point, they rather clearly show that the ratio of the magnetic field energy
density and the kinetic energy density of gas flow into the shock is of the
order of a few percent if the shock speed is high enough V_s > 10^3 km/s, and
this ratio remains nearly constant during the SNR evolution. The escape of the
highest energy nuclear particles from their sources becomes progressively
important with age, reducing also the cutoff in the \pi^0 -decay gamma-ray
emission spectrum with time after the end of the sweep-up phase. Simultaneously
the leptonic gamma-ray channels will gain in relative importance with
increasing age of the sources.

therefore consider the related case of accretion of gas with constant
vorticity, for the cases of both small and large vorticity. We confirm the
findings of earlier two dimensional simulations that even a small amount of
vorticity can substantially change both the accretion rate and the morphology
of the gas flow lines. We show that in three dimensions the resulting flow
field is non-axisymmetric and time dependent. The reduction in accretion rate
is due to an accumulation of circulation near the accreting particle. Using a
combination of simulations and analytic treatment, we provide an approximate
formula for the accretion rate of gas onto a point particle as a function of
the vorticity of the surrounding gas.

by dusty gas clouds that spurt out from circumnuclear starburst regions. For
the purpose, the dynamical evolution of gas clouds is pursued, including the
effects of radiation forces by an AGN as well as a starburst. Here, we solve
the radiative transfer equations for clouds, taking into consideration the
growth of clouds by inelastic cloud-cloud collisions and the resultant change
in optical depth. As a result, it is shown that if the starburst is more
luminous than the AGN, gas clouds are distributed extensively above a galactic
disk with the assistance of radiation pressure from the starburst. The total
covering factor of gas clouds reaches a maximum of around 20%. After several
$10^{7}$yr, gas clouds with larger optical depth form by cloud-cloud collisions
and thereafter the clouds fall back due to weakened radiation pressure. The
larger clouds undergo runaway growth and are eventually distributed around the
equatorial plane on the inner sides of circumnuclear starburst regions. These
clouds have an optical depth of several tens. The result is qualitatively
consistent with the putative tendency that Seyfert 2 galaxies appear more
frequently associated with starbursts than Seyfert 1s. On the other hand, if
the AGN luminosity overwhelms that of the starburst, almost all clouds are
ejected from the galaxy due to the radiation pressure from the AGN, resulting
in the formation of a quasar-like object. The origin of obscuration of AGNs is
discussed with relevant observations.

an inhomogeneous and fluffy structure. We investigate different methods to
describe light scattering by such composite particles. Both a model of layered
particles and discrete dipole calculations for particles with Rayleigh and
non-Rayleigh inclusions are used. The calculations demonstrate that porosity is
a key parameter for determining light scattering. We find that the optical
properties of the layered particles depend on the number and position of layers
if the number of layers is small ($\la 15$). For a larger number of layers the
scattering characteristics become independent of the layer sequence. The
optical properties of particles with inclusions depend on the size of
inclusions provided the porosity is large. The scattering characteristics of
very porous particles with inclusions of different sizes are found to be close
to those of multi-layered spheres. We compare the results of these calculations
with the predictions of the effective medium theories (EMT) which are often
used in astronomy as a tool to calculate the optical properties of composite
particles. The results of our analysis show that the internal structure of
grains (layers versus inclusions) only slightly affects the optics of particles
provided the porosity does not exceed 50%. It is also demonstrated that in this
case the optical properties of composite grains calculated with EMT agree with
the results of the exact method for layered particles. For larger porosity, the
standard EMT rules (i.e., Garnett and Bruggeman rules) give reliable results
for particles with Rayleigh inclusions only.

success rate of IT projects. These two aspects are the changes in the structure
of organizations and the epistemology of Information Systems Development.
Firstly, the conception of business processes within the management of
organizations increases the structural complexity of Information Systems,
because existing systems have to be integrated into a coherent cross-functional
architecture. Secondly, process thinking leads to a particular view of
organizations that ultimately has a negative effect on the support of
Information Systems. As an illustration of process thinking, the Business
Process Reengineering movement adheres to a technocratic management perspective
of organizations. Particularly this conception of organization views people as
mechanisms to realize certain organizational goals. As a result of this view
stakeholders are confronted with the implemented systems, rather than consulted
about the scope and functionality of those systems. Therefore, both aspects of
process thinking have a negative impact on the success of IT projects. The
problem of structural complexity is an area that is addressed by Enterprise
Application Integration, and mainly requires technical solutions. However, the
problems associated with the conception of organization require a different,
markedly non-technical, perspective. Several directions are discussed to
overcome some limitations of process thinking, but these directions are merely
small pointers. If truly effective and useful Information Systems are to be
acquired, IT practitioners and scientists require a completely different
mindset.

power-like running of the bulk U(1)_Y interaction, so that only the top
condensation is expected to take place. We explore such a possibility based on
the ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation and show the cutoff to make the model
viable.

composability) is a powerful tool for allowing the modular design of
cryptographic protocols (composition of protocols) and showing the security of
a given protocol embedded in a larger one. Recently, these methods have
received much attention in the quantum cryptographic community.
  We give a short introduction to simulatable security in general and proceed
by sketching the many different definitional choices together with their
advantages and disadvantages.
  Based on the reactive simulatability modelling of Backes, Pfitzmann and
Waidner we then develop a quantum security model. By following the BPW
modelling as closely as possible, we show that composable quantum security
definitions for quantum protocols can strongly profit from their classical
counterparts, since most of the definitional choices in the modelling are
independent of the underlying machine model.
  In particular, we give a proof for the simple composition theorem in our
