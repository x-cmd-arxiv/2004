galaxies across all Hubble types. We here present a spectroscopic study of the
exceptionally bright (10^6 - 10^8 Lsun) but compact (Re ~ 5 pc) nuclear star
clusters in very late type spirals with UVES at the VLT. We find the velocity
dispersions of the nine clusters in our sample to range from 13 to 34 km/s.
Using photometric data from the HST/WFPC2 and spherically symmetric dynamical
models we determine masses between 8*10^5 and 6*10^7 Msun. The mass to light
ratios range from 0.2 to 1.5 in the I band. This indicates a young mean age for
most clusters, in agreement with previous studies. Given their high masses and
small sizes we find that nuclear clusters are among the objects with the
highest mean surface density known (up to 10^5 Msun pc^-2). From their
dynamical properties we infer that, rather than small bulges, the closest
structural kin of nuclear clusters appear to be massive compact star clusters.
This includes such different objects as globular clusters, ""super star
clusters"", ultra compact dwarf galaxies and the nuclei of dwarf elliptical
galaxies. It is a challenge to explain why, despite the wildly different
current environments, all different types of massive star clusters share very
similar and structural properties. A possible explanation links UCDs and
massive globular clusters to nuclear star clusters through stripping of
nucleated dwarf galaxies in a merger event. The extreme properties of this type
of clusters would then be a consequence of their location in the centers of
their respective host galaxies.

ground-based particle accelerators and hence they are fundamental probes for
particle physics as well as astrophysics. Because of the scarcity of these
high-energy particles, larger and larger ground-based detectors have been
built. The new generation of digital radio telescopes may play an important
role in this, if properly designed. Radio detection of cosmic ray showers has a
long history but was abandoned in the 1970's. Recent experimental developments
together with sophisticated air shower simulations incorporating radio emission
give a clearer understanding of the relationship between the air shower
parameters and the radio signal, and have led to resurgence in its use.
Observations of air showers by the SKA could, because of its large collecting
area, contribute significantly to measuring the cosmic ray spectrum at the
highest energies. Because of the large surface area of the moon, and the
expected excellent angular resolution of the SKA, using the SKA to detect radio
Cherenkov emission from neutrino-induced cascades in lunar regolith will be
potentially the most important technique for investigating cosmic ray origin at

simulations of accreting tori in the Kerr metric with different black hole
spins. We focus on bound matter inside the initial pressure maximum, where the
time-averaged motion of gas is inward and an accretion disk forms. We use the
flows of mass, angular momentum, and energy in order to understand dynamics in
this region. The sharp reduction in accretion rate with increasing black hole
spin reported in Paper I of this series is explained by a strongly
spin-dependent outward flux of angular momentum conveyed electromagnetically;
when a/M > 0.9, this flux can be comparable to the inward angular momentum flux
carried by the matter. In all cases, there is outward electromagnetic angular
momentum flux throughout the flow; in other words, contrary to the assertions
of traditional accretion disk theory, there is in general no ""stress edge"", no
surface within which the stress is zero. The retardation of accretion in the
inner disk by electromagnetic torques also alters the radial distribution of
surface density, an effect that may have consequences for observable properties
such as Compton reflection. The net accreted angular momentum is sufficiently
depressed by electromagnetic effects that in the most rapidly-spinning black
holes mass growth can lead to spindown. Spinning black holes also lose energy
by Poynting flux; this rate is also a strongly increasing function of black
hole spin, rising to 10% or more of the rest-mass accretion rate at very high
spin. As the black hole spins faster, the path of the Poynting flux changes
from being predominantly within the accretion disk to predominantly within the
funnel outflow.

it has been difficult to determine whether or not DLAs show this effect,
primarily because of the very small number of DLA metallicity measurements at
low redshifts. In an attempt to put tighter constraints on the low-redshift end
of the DLA metallicity-redshift relation, we have observed Zn II and Cr II

much lower than the solar value. These results are consistent with recent
imaging studies indicating that these DLAs may be associated with dwarf or low

give the best-fitting. Particular cases with four or three independent free

F8) is computed and the results are compared with those from a similar model of
the Sun. The rotation pattern is determined by solving the Reynolds equation
including the convective energy transport. The latter is anisotropic due to the
Coriolis force causing a horizontal temperature gradient of ~ 7 K between the
poles and the equator. Comparison of the transport mechanisms of angular
momentum (the eddy viscosity, the $\Lambda$-effect and the meridional flow)
shows that for the F star the $\Lambda$-effect is the most powerful transporter
for rotation periods of 7 d or less. In the limit of very fast rotation the
$\Lambda$-effect is balanced by the meridional flow alone and the rotation is
nearly rigid. The rotation pattern found for the F star is very similar to the
solar rotation law, but the horizontal shear is about twice the solar value. As
a function of the rotation period, the total equator-pole difference of the
angular velocity has a (slight) maximum at a period of 7 d and (slowly)
vanishes in both the limiting cases of very fast and very slow rotation. A
comparison of the solar models with those for the F-type star shows a much
stronger dependence of the differential surface rotation on the stellar
luminosity rather than on the rotation rate.

turbulent density fluctuations in nearly isothermal molecular clouds. In the
non-magnetic case, clumps are unlikely to reach a hydrostatic state, and
instead are expected to either proceed directly to collapse, or else
``rebound'' towards the mean pressure and density of the parent cloud.
Rebounding clumps are delayed in their re-expansion by their self-gravity. From
a simple virial calculation, we find re-expansion times of a few free-fall
times. In the magnetic case, we present a series of driven-turbulence,
ideal-MHD isothermal numerical simulations in which we follow the evolution of
clumps and cores in relation to the magnetic criticality of their ``parent
clouds'' (the numerical boxes). In subcritical boxes, magnetostatic clumps do
not form. A few moderately-gravitationally bound clumps form which however are
dispersed by the turbulence in < 1.3 Myr. An estimate of the ambipolar
diffusion (AD) time scale t_AD in these cores gives t_AD > 1.3 Myr, only
slightly longer than the dynamical times. In supercritical boxes, some cores
become locally supercritical and collapse in typical times ~ 1 Myr. We also
observe longer-lived supercritical cores that however do not collapse because
they are smaller than the local Jeans length. Fewer clumps and cores form in
these simulations than in their non-magnetic counterpart. Our results suggest
that a) A fraction of the cores may not form stars, and may correspond to some
of the observed starless cores. b) Cores may be out-of-equilibrium structures,
rather than quasi-magnetostatic ones. c) The magnetic field may help reduce the
star formation efficiency by reducing the probability of core formation, rather
than by significantly delaying the collapse of individual cores.

in a timely fashion the large amount of spectroscopic data being produced. This
requirement has lead to the development of the VIMOS Interactive Pipeline and
Graphical Interface (VIPGI), a new software package designed to simplify to a
very high degree the task of reducing astronomical data obtained with VIMOS,
the imaging spectrograph built by the VIRMOS Consortium for the European
Southern Observatory, and mounted on Unit 3 (Melipal) of the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) at Paranal Observatory (Chile). VIPGI provides the astronomer
with specially designed VIMOS data reduction functions, a VIMOS-centric data
organizer, and dedicated data browsing and plotting tools, that can be used to
verify the quality and accuracy of the various stages of the data reduction
process. The quality and accuracy of the data reduction pipeline are comparable
to those obtained using well known IRAF tasks, but the speed of the data
reduction process is significantly increased, thanks to the large set of
dedicated features. In this paper we discuss the details of the MOS data
reduction pipeline implemented in VIPGI, as applied to the reduction of some
20,000 VVDS spectra, assessing quantitatively the accuracy of the various

computing light curves and spectra for 3-D supernovae. The radiative transfer
is time-dependent and includes all effects of O(v/c). Monte Carlo quantization
is achieved by discretizing the initial distribution of 56Ni into radioactive
pellets. Each pellet decays with the emission of a single energy packet
comprising gamma-ray photons representing one line from either the 56Ni or the
56Co decay spectrum. Subsequently, these energy packets propagate through the
homologously-expanding ejecta with appropriate changes in the nature of their
contained energy as they undergo Compton scatterings and pure absorptions.
  The 3-D code is tested by applying it to a spherically-symmetric SN in which
the transfer of optical radiation is treated with a grey absorption
coefficient. This 1-D problem is separately solved using Castor's co-moving
frame moment equations. Satisfactory agreement is obtained.
  The Monte Carlo code is a platform onto which more advanced treatments of the
interactions of matter and radiation can be added. Some of these have already
been developed and tested in previous papers and are summarized here.

cosmological population of massive black hole binaries. As done in our previous
paper, we follow the merger history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the
massive black holes they host, and their growth via gas accretion and binary
coalescences in a LCDM cosmology. Stellar dynamical processes dominates the
orbital evolution of black hole binaries at large separations, while
gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii, causing the final
coalescence of the pairs. We show that the GW signal from this population, in a
3 year LISA observation, will be resolved into approx 90 discrete events with
S/N>5, among which approx. 35 will be observed above threshold until
coalescence. These ""merging events"" involve relatively massive binaries, M=10E5

higher redshift, less massive binaries (M=5E3 Msun at z>6) and, although their
S/N integrated over the duration of the observation can be substantial, the
final coalescence phase is at too high frequency to be directly observable by
space-based interferometers such as LISA. LISA will be able to detect a

progress in understanding the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic
heterostructures from first principles, focusing on the role of spin pumping in
layered structures. The main body of the theory is semiclassical and based on a
mean-field Stoner or spin-density--functional picture, but quantum-size effects
and the role of electron-electron correlations are also discussed. A growing
number of experiments support the theoretical predictions. The formalism should
be useful to understand the physics and to engineer the characteristics of

multi-component fluid membranes, in general, and membranes containing
transmembrane proteins, in particular. Developed based on a minimal number of
principles of statistical physics and designed to be a meso/macroscopic-scale
effective description, the theory is formulated in terms of a set of equations
of hydrodynamics and linear constitutive relations. As a particular emphasis of
the theory, the equations and the constitutive relations address both the
thermodynamic and the hydrodynamic consequences of the unconventional material
characteristics of lipid-protein membranes and contain proposals as well as
predictions which have not yet been made in already existed work on membrane
hydrodynamics and which may have experimental relevance. The framework
structure of the theory makes possible its applications to a range of
non-equilibrium phenomena in a range of membrane systems, as discussions in the
paper of a few limit cases demonstrate.

all the superpartners and the Higgs bosons can be decoupled from the
electroweak scale, nevertheless no fine-tuning is needed. We present a concrete
model, as an existence proof of such a model, which generates the
superpotential dynamically. According to supersymmetry breaking scenarios to be
concerned, various phenomenological applications of our model are possible. For
example, based on our model, the recently proposed ``split supersymmetry''
scenario can be realized without fine-tuning. If the electroweak scale
supersymmetry breaking is taken into account, our model provides a similar
structure to the recently proposed ``fat Higgs'' model and the upper bound on

presence of a rapidity gap between the target and diffractive system requires
that the target remnant emerges in a color singlet state, which we show is made
possible by the soft rescattering of the struck quark. This rescattering is
described by the path-ordered exponential (Wilson line) in the expression for
the parton distribution function of the target. The multiple scattering of the
struck parton via instantaneous interactions in the target generates dominantly
imaginary diffractive amplitudes, giving rise to an ""effective pomeron""
exchange. The pomeron is not an intrinsic part of the proton but a dynamical
effect of the interaction. This picture also applies to diffraction in
hadron-initiated processes. Due to the different color environment the
rescattering is different in virtual photon- and hadron-induced processes,
explaining the observed non-universality of diffractive parton distributions.
This framework provides a theoretical basis for the phenomenologically
successful Soft Color Interaction model which includes rescattering effects and
thus generates a variety of final states with rapidity gaps. We discuss
developments of the SCI model to account for the color coherence features of
the underlying subprocesses.

c=0. These arise typically in the description of critical systems with quenched
disorder, but also in other contexts including dilute self-avoiding polymers
and percolation. We show that such CFTs must in general possess, in addition to
their stress energy tensor T(z), an extra field whose holomorphic part, t(z),
has conformal weight two. The singular part of the Operator Product Expansion
(OPE) between T(z) and t(z) is uniquely fixed up to a single number b, defining
a new `anomaly' which is a characteristic of any c=0 CFT, and which may be used
to distinguish between different such CFTs. The extra field t(z) is not primary
(unless b=0), and is a so-called `logarithmic operator' except in special cases
which include affine (Kac-Moody) Lie-super current algebras. The number b
controls the question of whether Virasoro null-vectors arising at certain
conformal weights contained in the c=0 Kac table may be set to zero or not, in
these nonunitary theories. This has, in the familiar manner, implications on
the existence of differential equations satisfied by conformal blocks involving
primary operators with Kac-table dimensions. It is shown that c=0 theories
where t(z) is logarithmic, contain, besides T and t, additional fields with
conformal weight two. If the latter are a fermionic pair, the OPEs between the
holomorphic parts of all these conformal weight-two operators are automatically
covariant under a global U(1|1) supersymmetry. A full extension of the Virasoro
algebra by the Laurent modes of these extra conformal weight-two fields,
including t(z), remains an interesting question for future work.

deformation parameter introduced via the dimension zero supertorsion given in
its most general form. The theory so obtained is referred to as the deformed
theory (to avoid the previously used term ""off-shell""). An important by-product
of this result is that any higher derivative correction to ordinary
supergravity of the same dimension as R^4, but not necessarily containing it,
derived e.g. from M-theory, must appear in a form compatible with the equations
obtained here. Unfortunately we have not yet much to say about the explicit
structure of these corrections in terms of the fields in the massless
supermultiplet. Our results are potentially powerful since if the dimension
zero torsion could be derived by other means, our reformulation of the Bianchi
identities as a number of algebraic relations implies that the full theory
would be known to first order in the deformation, including the dynamics. We
mention briefly some methods to derive the information needed to obtain
explicit answers both in the context of supergravity and ten-dimensional
super-Yang-Mills where the situation is better understood. Other relevant
aspects like spinorial cohomology, the role of the 3- and 6-form potentials and
the connection of these results to M2 and M5 branes are also commented upon.

parameter regions the systems allow for a freezing stabilization of these
spaces. In particular, we find for the 1/R model that configurations with
stabilized extra dimensions do not provide a late-time acceleration (they are
AdS), whereas the solution branch which allows for accelerated expansion (the
dS branch) is incompatible with stabilized factor spaces. In the case of the
R^4 model, we obtain that the stability region in parameter space depends on
the total dimension D=dim(M) of the higher dimensional spacetime M. For D>8 the
stability region consists of a single (absolutely stable) sector which is
shielded from a conformal singularity (and an antigravity sector beyond it) by
a potential barrier of infinite height and width. This sector is smoothly
connected with the stability region of a curvature-linear model. For D<8 an
additional (metastable) sector exists which is separated from the conformal
singularity by a potential barrier of finite height and width so that systems
in this sector are prone to collapse into the conformal singularity. This
second sector is not smoothly connected with the first (absolutely stable) one.
Several limiting cases and the possibility for inflation are discussed for the

sees explicitly that the strength of the edge current is proportional to the

the effect is analogous to the Hall effect, but with an internal potential. The
edge conductivity differs from the bulk (Hall) conductivity on the whole plane.

characteristic regions are distinguished. The main focus of this paper is to
delineate the regions in wave-number $k$ and time $t$ in which self-similarity
can (and cannot) be observed, taking into account small-$k$ and large-$k$
cutoffs. The evolution of the spectrum can be inferred using physical arguments
describing the competition between the initial spectrum and the new frequencies
generated by the dynamics. For large wavenumbers, we always have $k^{-2}$
region, associated to the shocks. When $n$ is less than one, the large-scale
part of the spectrum is preserved in time and the global evolution is
self-similar, so that scaling arguments perfectly predict the behavior in time
of the energy and of the integral scale. If $n$ is larger than two, the
spectrum tends for long times to a universal scaling form independent of the
initial conditions, with universal behavior $k^2$ at small wavenumbers. In the
interval $2<n$ the leading behaviour is self-similar, independent of $n$ and
with universal behavior $k^2$ at small wavenumber. When $1<n<2$, the spectrum
has three scaling regions : first, a $|k|^n$ region at very small $k$\ms1 with
a time-independent constant, second, a $k^2$ region at intermediate
wavenumbers, finally, the usual $k^{-2}$ region. In the remaining interval,
$n<-3$ the small-$k$ cutoff dominates, and $n$ also plays no role. We find also
(numerically) the subleading term $\sim k^2$ in the evolution of the spectrum
in the interval $-3<n<1$. High-resolution numerical simulations have been
performed confirming both scaling predictions and analytical asymptotic theory.

pixel sensors with a grazing angle hadron beam provide a sensitive
determination of the electric field within the detectors. The data are compared
with a complete charge transport simulation of the sensor which includes signal
trapping and charge induction effects. A linearly varying electric field based
upon the standard picture of a constant type-inverted effective doping density
is inconsistent with the data. A two-trap double junction model implemented in
ISE TCAD software can be tuned to produce a doubly-peaked electric field which
describes the data reasonably well at two different fluences. The modeled field
differs somewhat from previous determinations based upon the transient current
technique. The model can also account for the level of signal trapping observed
in the data.

  suspensions of rigid particles","LaTeX with amsmath, 31 pages, 12 figures, typos corrected",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  We study effective shear viscosity $\mu^\star$ and effective extensional
viscosity $\lambda^\star$ of concentrated non-colloidal suspensions of rigid
spherical particles. The focus is on the spatially disordered arrays. We use
recently developed discrete network approximation techniques to obtain
asymptotic formulas for the viscosities as the typical inter-particle distance
$\delta$ tends to zero. For disordered arrays, the volume fraction alone does
not determine the effective viscosity. Use of the network approximation allows
us to study the dependence of the effective viscosities on variable distances
between neighboring particles. Our analysis can be characterized as global
because it goes beyond the local analysis of the flow between two particles.
The principal conclusion in the paper is that, in general, asymptotic formulas
obtained by global analysis are different from the formulas obtained from local
analysis. In particular, the leading term in the asymptotics of $\mu^\star$ is
of lower order than suggested by the local analysis (weak blow up), while the
order of the leading term in the asymptotics of $\lambda^\star$ depends on the
geometry of the particle array (either weak or strong blow up). We obtain
geometric conditions on a random particle array that lead to the strong blow up
of $\lambda^\star$, and show that these conditions are generic. We also provide
an example of a closely packed particle array for which the leading term in the
asymptotics of $\lambda^\star$ degenerates (weak blow up).

as an optical frequency standard. This proposal permits the use of the even
isotopes, in which the clock transition is narrower than in proposed clocks
using the odd isotopes and the energy interval is not affected by external
magnetic fields or the polarization of trapping light. The method has the
unique feature that the width and rate of the clock transition can be
continuously adjusted from the $MHz$ level to sub-$mHz$ without loss of signal
amplitude by varying the intensities of the three optical beams. Doppler and
recoil effects can be eliminated by proper alignment of the three optical beams
or by point confinement in a lattice trap. The three beams can be mixed to
produce the optical frequency corresponding to the $^{3}P_{0}$ - $^{1}S_{0}$
clock interval.

conductivity of the top and bottom plates on the heat transport in the fluid to
obtain estimates of N_infty for plates with infinite conductivity. The results
for N_infty and Gamma >= 0.43 are nearly independent of Gamma. For Gamma =
0.275 N_infty falls about 2.5 % below the other data. For R ~<= 10^11, the
effective exponent gamma_eff of N_infty = N_0 R^gamma_eff is about 0.321,
larger than those of the Grossmann-Lohse model with its current parameters by
about 0.01. For the largest Rayleigh numbers covered for Gamma = 0.98, 0.67,

and quantum computing have increasingly taught us that it can be helpful to
think about physics itself in computational terms. For example, work over the
last decade has shown that the energy of a quantum system limits the rate at
which it can perform significant computational operations, and suggests that we
might validly interpret energy as in fact being the speed at which a physical
system is ""computing,"" in some appropriate sense of the word. In this paper, we
explore the precise nature of this connection. Elementary results in quantum
theory show that the Hamiltonian energy of any quantum system corresponds
exactly to the angular velocity of state-vector rotation (defined in a certain
natural way) in Hilbert space, and also to the rate at which the state-vector's
components (in any basis) sweep out area in the complex plane. The total angle
traversed (or area swept out) corresponds to the action of the Hamiltonian
operator along the trajectory, and we can also consider it to be a measure of
the ""amount of computational effort exerted"" by the system, or effort for
short. For any specific quantum or classical computational operation, we can
(at least in principle) calculate its difficulty, defined as the minimum effort
required to perform that operation on a worst-case input state, and this in
turn determines the minimum time required for quantum systems to carry out that
operation on worst-case input states of a given energy. As examples, we
calculate the difficulty of some basic 1-bit and n-bit quantum and classical
operations in an simple unconstrained scenario.

  anything, changed title to reflect new emphasis",,,,"quant-ph",,"  By implicitly assuming that all measurements occur simultaneously, Bell's
Theorem only applied to local theories that violated Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle. By explicitly introducing time into our derivation of Bell's
theorem, an extra term related to the time-ordering of actual measurements is
found to augment (i.e. weaken) the upper bound of the inequality. Since the
same locality assumptions hold for this rederivation as for the original, we
conclude that only {\em classical} measurement-order independent local hidden
variable theories are constrained by Bell's inequality; time dependent,
non-classical local theories (i.e. theories respecting Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle) can satisfy this new bound while exceeding Bell's limit.
Unconditional nonlocality is only expected to occur with Bell parameters
between $2\sqrt{2}$ and 4. This weakening of Bell's inequality is seen for the
quantum Bell operator (squared) as an extra term involving the commutators of
{\em local} measurement operators. We note that a factorizable second-quantized
wavefunction can reproduce experimental measurements; because such
wavefunctions allow local de Broglie-Bohm hidden variable modelling, we have
another indication that violation of {\em Bell's} inequality does not require
an acceptance of non-locality.

at the time when the experimental conditions of the wave-particle duality of
photons are chosen. Choice signals can be used as transmitting signals and the
wave-particle duality of photons is used as receiving signals. For example, if
we choose the wave property of a photon as a transmitting signal, we detect the
interference of the wave at the detector that can be used as a receiving
signal. Therefore, the experimental setup of the delayed-choice experiment can
transmit information through interference.
