history of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and the extent to which accreting
black holes (BHs) can help explain these observations. We show new evidence,
based on the combined statistics of Lyman alpha and beta absorption in quasar
spectra, that the IGM contains a significant amount of neutral hydrogen, and is
experiencing rapid ionization around redshift z=6. However, we argue that
quasar BHs, even faint ones that are below the detection thresholds of existing
optical surveys, are unlikely to drive the evolution of the neutral fraction
around this epoch, because they would over-produce the present-day soft X-ray
background. On the other hand, the seeds of the quasar BHs around z=6 likely
appeared at much earlier epochs (around z=20), and produced hard ionizing
radiation by accretion. These early BHs are promising candidates to account for
the high redshift ionization (around z=15) implied by the recent cosmic
microwave anisotropy data from WMAP. Using a model for the growth of BHs by
accretion and mergers in a hierarchical cosmology, we suggest that the early
growth of quasars must include a super-Eddington growth phase, and that,
although not yet optically identified, the FIRST radio survey may have already
detected several thousand BHs at z>6 with Mbh>10^8 Msun.

they represent persistent primordial magnetism? What role do magnetic fields
play in turbulence, cosmic ray acceleration and galaxy formation? Here we
demonstrate how the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) can deliver new data which
will directly address these currently unanswered issues. Much of what we
present is based on an all-sky survey of rotation measures, in which Faraday
rotation towards >10^7 background sources will provide a dense grid for probing
magnetism in the Milky Way, in nearby galaxies, and in distant galaxies,
clusters and protogalaxies. Using these data, we can map out the evolution of
magnetised structures from redshifts z>3 to the present, can distinguish
between different origins for seed magnetic fields in galaxies, and can develop
a detailed model of the magnetic field geometry of the intergalactic medium and
of the overall Universe. With the unprecedented capabilities of the SKA, the
window to the Magnetic Universe can finally be opened.

bright companion galaxies seem not to be important for the appearance of CNRs,

four CuO_{2}-unit-cell square checkerboard, independent of energy. Intricate
atomic-scale electronic structure variations also exist within the

Measurements of the steady-state spin polarization in the semiconductor

structures form excitons, and the spin polarization in the quantum well depends
strongly on the electrical bias conditions. At intermediate temperatures, the
spin polarization is determined primarily by the spin relaxation rate for free
electrons in the quantum well. This process is slow relative to the excitonic
spin relaxation rate at lower temperatures and is responsible for a broad
maximum in the spin polarization between 100 and 200 K. The spin injection
efficiency of the Fe/Al_xGa_{1-x}As Schottky barrier decreases at higher

that they are less steeply decreasing, as generically expected. One candidate
is the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux, a probe of cosmic ray composition in
the region of the knee as well as small-$x$ QCD, below the reach of collider
experiments. A second is the diffuse extragalactic background due to distant
and unresolved AGNs and GRBs, a key test of the nature of the highest-energy

sense of A.D. Alexandrov). We show that such a complex X admits a graph of
spaces decomposition. It is also shown that when dim X=3, X contains a closed
rank one geodesic in the 1-skeleton unless the universal cover of X is
isometric to the product of two CAT(0) cubical complexes.

of topological diagonalization properties involving tau-covers, show that the
remaining two cardinals are equal, and give a consistency result concerning
this remaining cardinal. Consequently, 21 open problems concerning potential
implications between these properties are settled. We also give structural
results based on the combinatorial techniques.

inputs into any mistrustful quantum cryptographic protocol. The argument
illuminates the impossibility of unconditionally secure quantum implementations
of essentially classical tasks such as bit commitment with a certified
classical committed bit, classical oblivious transfer, and secure classical
multi-party computations of secret classical data. It applies to both
non-relativistic and relativistic protocols.
