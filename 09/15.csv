2002bo is derived by fitting a series of spectra obtained at close time
intervals. A Monte Carlo code, modified to include abundance stratification, is
used to compute synthetic spectra at 13 epochs in the photospheric phase,
starting 13d before B maximum. A description of the abundance distribution
above 7600 km/s is thus obtained. Abundances in deeper layers, down to zero
velocity, are derived from models of two nebular-phase spectra. Elements
synthesized in different stages of burning are significantly, but not
completely, mixed in the ejecta. A total 56Ni mass of 0.52M_sun is derived.
Evidence for intermediate-mass elements at high velocities (> 18 000 km/s) is
found, most clearly in Si II 6355A, in Ca II H&K, and in the Ca II infrared
triplet. Carbon lines are not seen at any velocity, with possible implications
for the progenitor/explosion scenario. A synthetic bolometric light curve
computed using the inferred abundance distribution is in very good agreement
with the observed one, providing an independent check. In particular, the fast
rise of the light curve is reproduced very well. This is due to outward mixing
of 56Ni, which is clearly well determined by the spectroscopic modelling.

indicate that at least seven dEs have significant velocity gradients along
their optical major axis, with typical rotation amplitudes of 20-30 km/s. Of
the remaining nine galaxies in this sample, 6 have velocity gradients less than
20 km/s kpc^{-1} while the other 3 observations had too low of a
signal--to--noise ratio to determine an accurate velocity gradient. Typical
velocity dispersions for these galaxies are ~44 +/- 5 km/s, indicating that
rotation can be a significant component of the stellar dynamics of Virgo dEs.
When corrected for the limited spatial extent of the spectral data, the
rotation amplitudes of the rotating dEs are comparable to those of similar
brightness dIs. Evidence for a relationship between the rotation amplitude and
galaxy luminosity is found, and, in fact, agrees well with the Tully-Fisher
relation. The similarity in the scaling relations of dIs and dEs implies that
it is unlikely that dEs evolve from significantly more luminous galaxies. These
observations reaffirm the possibility that some cluster dwarf elliptical
galaxies may be formed when the neutral gaseous medium is stripped from dwarf
irregular galaxies in the cluster environment. We hypothesize that several
different mechanisms are involved in the creation of the overall population of
dE galaxies, and that stripping of infalling dIs may be the dominant process in
the creation of dEs in clusters like Virgo.

difference in dominant stellar population between rotating and non-rotating
dwarf elliptical galaxies; the average age of the dominant stellar population
is 5-7 Gyr in all 16 galaxies in this sample. Analysis of optical spectra
confirm these age estimates and indicate Fe and Mg abundances in the range of
1/20th to 1/3 of solar, as expected for low luminosity galaxies. Based on Lick
indices and simple stellar population models, the derived [alpha/Fe] ratios are
sub-solar to solar, indicating a more gradual chemical enrichment history for
dEs as compared to giant elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. These
observations confirm the marked difference in stellar population and stellar
distribution between dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies and further
substantiate the need for alternative evolutionary scenarios for the lowest
mass cluster galaxies. We argue that it is likely that several different
physical mechanisms played a significant role in the production of the Virgo
cluster dE galaxies including in situ formation, infall of dEs that were once
part of Local Group analogs, and transformation of dwarf irregular galaxies by
the cluster environment. The observations support the hypothesis that a large
fraction of the Virgo cluster dEs are formed by ram pressure stripping of gas
from infalling dIs.

established by the self-similar infall of collisionless matter. We find this
function explicitly for isotropic and spherically symmetric systems in terms of
cosmological initial conditions. The coarse-grained function is structureless
and steady but the familiar phase space sheet sub-structure is recovered in the
fine-grained limit. By breaking the self-similarity of the halo infall we are
able to argue for a central density flattening. In addition there will be an
edge steepening. The best fitting analytic density function is likely to be
provided by a high order polytrope fit smoothly to an outer power law of index
-3 for isolated systems. There may be a transition to a -4 power law in the
outer regions of tidally truncated systems.
  We find a progressive central flattening that is expected to end either in
the non-singular isothermal sphere, or in non-singular metastable polytropic
cores. Therefore a collisionless system may pass through a family of polytropes
of increasing order, finally approaching the limit of the non-singular
isothermal sphere, if the `violent' collective relaxation is frequently
re-excited by `merger' events. Our results suggest that no physics beyond that
of the moderate collective relaxation often known as `violent relaxation' (due
we think to wave-particle scattering) is necessary to explain the nature of
dark matter density profiles.

black hole X-ray binary systems. We argue that during the rising phase of a
black hole transient outburst the steady jet known to be associated with the
canonical 'low/hard' state persists while the X-ray spectrum initially softens.
Subsequently, the jet becomes unstable and an optically thin radio outburst is
always associated with the soft X-ray peak at the end of this phase of
softening. This peak corresponds to a 'soft very high state' or 'steep power
law' state. Softer X-ray states are not associated with 'core' radio emission.
We further demonstrate quantitatively that the transient jets associated with
these optically thin events are considerably more relativistic than those in
the 'low/hard' X-ray state. This in turn implies that as the disc makes its
collapse inwards the jet Lorentz factor rapidly increases, resulting in an
internal shock in the outflow, which is the cause of the observed optically
thin radio emission. In addition, we estimate the jet power for a number of
such transient events as a function of X-ray luminosity, and find them to be
comparable to an extrapolation of the functions estimated for the 'low/hard'
state jets. Finally, we attempt to fit these results together into a coherent
semi-quantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in all black hole X-ray
binary systems (abridged).

in a cluster distance of 118 pc; ~10% shorter than the `classical' results of
MS-fitting. In an earlier paper we developed a purely empirical MS-fitting
method to address this problem, which produced conflicting results between the
(B-V) and (V-I) colour indices, indicating that the cluster's photometric
metallicity is substantially lower than its (~solar) spectroscopic metallicity.
We were able to reconcile the discrepancy by assuming [Fe/H]=-0.4 (as indicated
from (B-V)/(V-I) colour-colour plots), and the distance moduli obtained from
the 2 indices were in agreement with the Hipparcos result, within the 1sig
errors. With the release of the 2MASS All Sky Catalogue, we now apply our
MS-fitting method to the Pleiades using the infrared colours, in order to test
the plausibility of our earlier result. Fitting in the V/(V-K) and K/(J-K)
colour planes, we find that assuming a subsolar metallicity does not produce
distances in agreement with the (B-V) and (V-I) results. However the infrared
plus (V-I) distances are in mutual agreement when adopting the spectroscopic
metallicity. By considering only stars with Mv<=6, the infrared and optical
colour indices all yield consistent distances using the spectroscopic [Fe/H].
The concordant distances thus obtained from the (B-V), (V-I), (V-K) and (J-K)
indices yield a mean of 133.8+/-3 pc, in excellent agreement with the
pre-Hipparcos MS-fitting results, and the most recent determinations from other
methods. We conclude that there are two distinct issues affecting the Pleiades:
the Hipparcos parallax is in error by ~10%, as previously claimed; the (B-V)

vicinity of strong gravitational field sources is investigated in the frame of
General Relativity. We argue that gravitational redshifting should be taken
into account to model such outflows. The generalization of the Sobolev
approximation in the frame of General Relativity is presented. We consider all
processes in the metric of a nonrotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. The
radiation force that is due to absorbtion of the radiation flux in lines is
derived. It is demonstrated that if gravitational redshifting is taken into
account, the radiation force becomes a function of the local velocity gradient
(as in the standard line-driven wind theory) and the gradient of $g_{00}$. We
derive a general relativistic equation of motion describing such flow. A
solution of the equation of motion is obtained and confronted with that
obtained from the Castor, Abbott & Klein (CAK) theory. It is shown that the
proposed mechanism could have an important contribution to the formation of
line-driven outflows from compact objects.

will accumulate tens of millions of rotation measure measurements toward

magnetic fields in individual Galactic supernova remnants and HII regions, for
characterizing the overall magnetic geometry of our Galaxy's disk and halo, and
for understanding the structure and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies.
Also of considerable interest will be the mapping of diffuse polarized emission
from the Milky Way in many narrow bands over a wide frequency range. This will
allow us to carry out Faraday tomography of the Galaxy, yielding a
high-resolution three-dimensional picture of the magnetic field within a few
kpc of the Sun, and allowing us to understand its coupling to the other

highly uncertain, but could be as large as a few percent. While halo
substructure is seen in numerical simulations of CDM haloes, little of this
substructure survives in the innermost regions of haloes, and thus the
observational claims for substructure at small projected radii are slightly
surprising. There is evidence, however, that even the highest-resolution
simulations published to-date are still limited by numerical effects that heat
and disrupt substructure artificially in high-density regions. By comparing
numerical and semi-analytic models of halo substructure, we show that current

Potsdam Multi Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS) we investigate a galaxy at an
impact parameter of 6"".4 which is most probably responsible for the absorption
lines. A fainter galaxy at a similar redshift and a slightly larger distance
from the QSO is known to exist, but we assume that the absorption is caused by
the more nearby galaxy. From optical Balmer lines we estimate an intrinsic
reddening consistent with 0, and a moderate star formation rate of 0.5 M_sun
yr^-1, is inferred from the Halpha luminosity. Using nebular emission line
ratios we find a solar oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)=8.7+/-0.1 and a solar
nitrogen to oxygen abundance ratio log(N/O)=-1.0+/-0.2. This abundance is
larger than those of all known sub-DLA systems derived from analyses of metal
absorption lines in quasar spectra. On the other hand, the properties are
compatible with the most metal rich galaxies responsible for strong Mg II
absorption systems. These two categories can be reconciled if we assume an
abundance gradient similar to local galaxies. Under that assumption we predict
abundances 12+log(O/H)=7.1 and log(N/O)=-1.9 for the sub-DLA cloud, which is
similar to high redshift DLA and sub-DLA systems. We find evidence for a
rotational velocity of ~200 km s^-1 over a length of ~7 kpc. From the geometry

belong to a rotating disk, but could originate in a rotating halo.

measured on a lattice in Michael and Peisa, Phys. Rev. D 58, 34506 (1998). We
have now repeated this study using several different lattices, quenched and
unquenched, that have different physical lattice sizes, clover coefficients and
quark-gluon couplings. The heavy quark is taken to be infinitely heavy, whereas
the light quark mass is approximately that of the strange quark. By
interpolating and extrapolating in the light quark mass we can thus compare the
lattice results with B and B_s meson experiments. Most interesting is the
lowest P-wave B_s state, since it is possible that it lies below the $BK$
threshold and hence is very narrow. Unfortunately, there are no experimental
results on P-wave B or B_s mesons available at present.
  In addition to the energy spectrum, we measured earlier also vector (charge)
and scalar (matter) radial distributions of the light quark in the S-wave
states of a heavy-light meson on a lattice (Phys. Rev. D 65, 014512 (2002) and

suppressed to the level of {\cal O}(0.1) for the CP phase of order unity.
Although it is much stronger than the known constraint from the chargino loop
contribution to b \to s \gamma, the moderate constraint we obtain here is
argued to leave room for sizable supersymmetric contribution to the CP
asymmetry in B_d^0 \to \phi K^0.

they are related to parton densities in coordinate space. Namely, the diagonal

evaluated using Swendsen's renormalization method. We focus on the

the octupole and quadrupole degrees of freedom, valid for nuclei close to the
axial symmetry. Amplitudes of oscillation in other degrees of freedom different
from the axial ones are assumed to be small, but not frozen to zero. The case
of nuclei which already possess a permanent quadrupole deformation is discussed
in some more detail and a simple solution is obtained at the critical point of
the phase transition between harmonic octupole oscillation and a permanent
asymmetric shape. The results are compared with experimental data of the
Thorium isotopic chain. The isotope Th-226 is found to be close to the critical

from a good RNG and is hence an appropriate building block for an RNG, although
unnecessary correlations are always present in practice. We show that
introducing hidden variables and introducing rotation in the RNG output,
accompanied with the proper initialization, dramatically suppress these
correlations. We analyze the mechanisms of the single-cat-map correlations
analytically and show how to diminish them. We generalize the Percival-Vivaldi
theory in the case of the ensemble of maps, find the period of the proposed RNG
analytically, and also analyze its properties. We present efficient practical
realizations for the RNGs and check our predictions numerically. We also test

ceases to be a good quantum number--all $n$s within a given mode family being
coupled. It is found that the discrete spectrum of unstable ideal MHD
(magnetohydrodynamic) instabilities ceases to exist unless MHD is modified
(regularized) by introducing a short-perpendicular-wavelength cutoff. Attempts
to use ray tracing to estimate the regularized MHD spectrum fail due to the
occurrence of chaotic ray trajectories. In quantum chaos theory, strong chaos
in the semiclassical limit leads to eigenvalue statistics the same as those of
a suitable ensemble of random matrices. For instance, the probability
distribution function for the separation between neighboring eigenvalues is as
derived from random matrix theory and goes to zero at zero separation. This
contrasts with the Poissonian distribution found in separable systems, showing
that a signature of quantum chaos is level repulsion. In order to determine
whether eigenvalues of the regularized MHD problem obey the same statistics as
those of the Schr\""odinger equation in both the separable 1-D case and the
chaotic 3-D cases, we have assembled data sets of ideal MHD eigenvalues for a
Suydam-unstable cylindrical (1-D) equilibrium using \emph{Mathematica} and a
Mercier-unstable (3-D) equilibrium using the CAS3D code. In the 1-D case, we
find that the unregularized Suydam-approximation spectrum has an anomalous peak
at zero eigenvalue separation. On the other hand, regularization by restricting
the domain of $\kvec_{\perp}$ recovers the expected Poissonian distribution. In
the 3-D case we find strong evidence of level repulsion within mode families,
but mixing mode families produces Poissonian statistics.

the capacities of self renewal and pluripotential differentiation. Adult stem
cells renew their own tissue, but whether they can trans-differentiate to other
tissues is still controversial. To understand the genetic program that
underlies the pluripotency of stem cells, we compared the transcription profile
of ESC with that of progenitor/stem cells of human hematopoietic and
keratinocytic origins, along with their mature cells to be viewed as snapshots
along tissue differentiation. ESC gene profile show higher complexity with
significantly more highly expressed genes than adult cells. We hypothesize that
ESC use a strategy of expressing genes that represent various differentiation
pathways and selection of only a few for continuous expression upon
differentiation to a particular target. Such a strategy may be necessary for
the pluripotency of ESC. The progenitors of either hematopoietic or
keratinocytic cells also follow the same design principle. Using advanced
clustering, we show that many of the ESC expressed genes are turned off in the
progenitors/stem cells followed by a further downregulation in adult tissues.
Concomitantly, genes specific to the target tissue are upregulated towards
matured cells of skin or blood.

has direct bearing on choice of therapy. Several microarray studies yielded
gene sets whose expression profiles successfully predicted survival (Ramaswamy
et al 2003; Sorlie et al 2001; van't Veer et al 2003). Nevertheless, the
overlap between these gene sets is almost zero. Such small overlaps were
observed also in other complex diseases (Lossos et al 2003; Miklos and Maleszka
2004), and the variables that could account for the differences had evoked a
wide interest. One of the main open questions in this context is whether the
disparity can be attributed only to trivial reasons such as different
technologies, different patients and different types of analysis. Results: To
answer this question we concentrated on one single breast cancer dataset, and
analyzed it by one single method, the one which was used by van't Veer et al to
produce a set of outcome predictive genes. We showed that in fact the resulting
set of genes is not unique; it is strongly influenced by the subset of patients
used for gene selection. Many equally predictive lists could have been produced
from the same analysis. Three main properties of the data explain this
sensitivity: (a) many genes are correlated with survival; (b) the differences
between these correlations are small; (c) the correlations fluctuate strongly
when measured over different subsets of patients. A possible biological
explanation for these properties is discussed.
