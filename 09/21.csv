of probing dark-energy models. While most studies have focused on spectroscopic
surveys at high redshift, large multi-color imaging surveys have already been
planned for the near future. In view of this, we study the prospects for
measuring baryonic oscillations from angular statistics of galaxies binned
using photometric redshifts. We use the galaxy bispectrum in addition to the
power spectrum; this allows us to measure and marginalize over possibly complex
galaxy bias mechanisms to get robust cosmological constraints. In our parameter
estimation we allow for a weakly nonlinear biasing scheme that may evolve with
redshift by two bias parameters in each of ten redshift bins. We find that a
multi-color imaging survey that probes redshifts beyond one can give
interesting constraints on dark-energy parameters. In addition, the shape of
the primordial power spectrum can be measured to better accuracy than with the
CMB alone. We explore the impact of survey depth, area, and calibration errors
in the photometric redshifts on dark-energy constraints.

which is superimposed on a synchrotron spectrum which gradually steepens
towards shorter wavelengths throughout the FIR and MIR spectral range. The dust

ingredients of chemical evolution models, for which different recipes can be
found in the literature. In this paper, we quantify the effects on chemical
evolution studies of the uncertainties in these two parameters. We concentrate
on chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, because of the large number of
good observational constraints. Such chemical evolution models have already
ruled out significant temporal variations for the stellar initial mass function
in our own Galaxy, with the exception perhaps of the very early phases of its
evolution. Therefore, here we assume a Galactic initial mass function constant
in time. Through an accurate comparison of model predictions for the Milky Way
with carefully selected data sets, it is shown that specific prescriptions for
the initial mass function in particular mass ranges should be rejected. As far
as the stellar lifetimes are concerned, the major differences among existing
prescriptions are found in the range of very low-mass stars. Because of this,
the model predictions widely differ for those elements which are produced
mostly by very long-lived objects, as for instance 3He and 7Li. However, it is
concluded that model predictions of several important observed quantities,
constraining the plausible Galactic formation scenarios, are fairly robust with
respect to changes in both the stellar mass spectrum and the stellar lifetimes.
For instance, the metallicity distribution of low-mass stars is nearly
unaffected by these changes, since its shape is dictated mostly by the time
scale for thin-disk formation.

$\sim9\times10^{10}$ \Msun. Two velocity components are seen in the CO spectra;

the boiling-pot model: a deflagration characterized by the (nearly-)
simultaneous ignition of a number of bubbles that pervade the core of the white
dwarf. Thermal fluctuations larger than >1% of the background temperature
(7x10^8 K) on lengthscales of < 1m could be the seeds of the bubbles.
Variations of the homogeneity of the temperature perturbations can lead to two
alternative configurations at carbon runaway: if the thermal gradient is small,
all the bubbles grow to a common characteristic size related to the value of
the thermal gradient, but if the thermal gradient is large enough, the size
spectrum of the bubbles extends over several orders of magnitude. The explosion
phase has been studied with the aid of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code
suited to simulate thermonuclear supernovae. In spite of important procedural
differences and different physical assumptions, our results converge with the
most recent calculations of 3D deflagrations in white dwarfs carried out in
supernova studies by different groups. For large initial numbers of bubbles
(>3-4 per octant), the explosion produces about 0.45 solar masses of 56Ni, and
the kinetic energy of the ejecta is 0.45x10^{51} ergs. However, all
three-dimensional deflagration models share three main drawbacks: 1) the scarce
synthesis of intermediate-mass elements, 2) the loss of chemical stratification
of the ejecta due to mixing by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities during the first

These have a direct impact on the redshift of collapse, altering in consequence
the linearly extrapolated density threshold above which structures will end up

homogeneous dark energy; and second, when the field inside the overdensity
collapses along with the dark matter - inhomogeneous dark energy. One shows

985 with a new Chandra-HETGS observation and an archival BeppoSAX observation.
Two absorption components are clearly required to fit absorption features
observed in the Chandra spectrum. The components have a difference of 29 in
ionization parameter and 3 in column density. The presence of the low
ionization component is evidenced by an Fe M-shell unresolved transition array
(UTA) produced by charge states VII to XIII. The high ionization phase is
required by the presence of broad absorption features arising from several
blends of Fe L-shell transitions (Fe XVII-XXII). A third highly ionized
component might also be present, but the data does not allow to constrain its
properties. An X-ray luminosity variation by a factor 2.3 is observed between
the BeppoSAX and Chandra observations (separated by almost 3 years).
Variability in the opacity of the absorbers is detected in response to the
continuum variation, but while the colder component is consistent with a simple
picture of photoionization equilibrium, the ionization state of the hotter
component seems to increase while the continuum flux drops. The most striking
result in our analysis is that during both the Chandra and the BeppoSAX
observations, the two absorbing components appear to have the same pressure.
Thus, we suggest that the absorption arises from a multi-phase wind. Such
scenario can explain the change in opacity of both absorption components during
the observations, but requires that a third hotter component is
pressure-confining the two phases. Hence, our analysis points to a 3-phase
medium similar to the wind found in NGC 3783, and further suggests that such a
wind might be a common characteristic in AGN.

obstacles to the precise measurement of the stellar position. We present
results on disk influences to the stellar wobble. The density waves excited by
a planet move both of the disk's mass center and the photo-center. The motion
of the disk mass center induces an additional wobble of the stellar position,
and the motion of the disk photo-center causes a contamination in the
measurement of the stellar position. We show that the additional stellar motion
dynamically caused by the disk's gravity is always negligible, but that the
contamination of the disk light can interfere with the precise measurement of
the stellar position, if the planet's mass is smaller than ~10 Jupiter mass.
The motion of the disk photo-center is sensitive to a slight change in the wave
pattern and the disk properties. Measurements by interferometers are generally
insensitive to extended sources such as disks. Because of this property SIM
will not suffer significant contaminations of the disk light, even if the
planet's mass is as small as 1 Jupiter mass.

(a factor of two in about 5000 s). When the X-ray spectrum is fit with a two

One interesting feature of the present observation is the possible detection of
variability in the absorption features: the absorption lines are visible only
when the source is bright. From the upper limits of the equivalent widths (EW)
of the absorption lines during the low flux states and also from the model
independent pulse height ratios, we argue that the strength of absorption is
lower during the low flux states. This constraints the physical size of the
absorbing medium within 100 Schwartzschild radius (Rg) of the putative
supermassive black hole. We also find a marginal evidence for a correlation
between the strength of the absorption line and the X-ray luminosity.

variable in the intermittent, turbulent interplanetary medium are scale
dependent. Strong non-Gaussianity of solar wind fluctuations applies for short
time-lag spacecraft observations, corresponding to small-scale spatial
separations, whereas for large scales the differences turn into a Gaussian
normal distribution. These characteristics were hitherto described in the
context of the log-normal, the Castaing distribution or the shell model. On the
other hand, a possible explanation for nonlocality in turbulence is offered
within the context of nonextensive entropy generalization by a recently
introduced bi-kappa distribution, generating through a convolution of a
negative-kappa core and positive-kappa halo pronounced non-Gaussian structures.
The PDFs of solar wind scalar field differences are computed from WIND and ACE
data for different time lags and compared with the characteristics of the
theoretical bi-kappa functional, well representing the overall scale dependence
of the spatial solar wind intermittency. The observed PDF characteristics for
increased spatial scales are manifest in the theoretical distribution
functional by enhancing the only tuning parameter $\kappa$, measuring the
degree of nonextensivity where the large-scale Gaussian is approached for
$\kappa \to \infty$. The nonextensive approach assures for experimental studies
of solar wind intermittency independence from influence of a priori model
assumptions. It is argued that the intermittency of the turbulent fluctuations
should be related physically to the nonextensive character of the
interplanetary medium counting for nonlocal interactions via the entropy
generalization.

the local 850 micron sub-mm luminosity density converges to (7.3+/-0.2)x10^{19}

extragalactic background light together strongly constrain the cosmic star
formation history for a wide class of evolutionary assumptions. We find that
the extragalactic background light, the 850 micron 8mJy source counts, and the
Omega_* constraints all independently point to a decline in the comoving star
formation rate at z>1. In order to reconcile this with direct determinations,
we suggest either there is a top-heavy initial mass function at high redshifts,
and/or there is stronger evolution in the more luminous far-infrared galaxies

precisions of $\sim 1-3 \times 10^{-4}$ with 15-minute time resolution should
be sufficient to discover such ring systems. For some ring particle sizes,
diffraction around individual particles leads to a detectable level of
forward-scattering that can be used to measure modal ring particle diameters.
An initial census of large ring systems can be carried out using high-precision
follow-up observations of detected transits and by the upcoming NASA
\emph{Kepler} mission. The distribution of ring systems as a function of
stellar age and as a function of planetary semimajor axis will provide
empirical evidence to help constrain how rings form and how long rings last.

understanding of rupture phenomena but only a partial classification in
restricted and relatively simple situations. This lack of fundamental
understanding is indeed reflected in the absence of reliable prediction methods
for rupture, based on a suitable monitoring of the stressed system. Not only is
there a lack of non-empirical understanding of the reliability of a system, but
also the empirical laws themselves have often limited value. The difficulties
stem from the complex interplay between heterogeneities and modes of damage and
the possible existence of a hierarchy of characteristic scales (static and
dynamic).
  The paper presents a review of recent efforts from the statistical physics
community to address these points.

a crossover of dominant scattering mechanism from ionized impurity to acoustic

the slave, for the equilibrium susceptibility of a one dimensional Langevin
process x_t in a potential phi(x). The susceptibility can be measured by
evolving the slave equation in conjunction with the original Langevin process.
This procedure yields a direct estimate of the susceptibility and avoids the
need, when performing numerical simulations, to include applied external fields
explicitly. The success of the method however depends on the statistical
properties of the slave estimator. The joint probability density function for
x_t and xi_t is analyzed. In the case where the potential of the system has a
concave component the probability density function of the slave acquires a
power law tail characterized by a temperature dependent exponent. Thus we show
that while the average value of the slave, in the equilibrium state, is always
finite and given by the fluctuation dissipation relation, higher moments and
indeed the variance may show divergences. The behavior of the power law
exponent is analyzed in a general context and it is calculated explicitly in
some specific examples. Our results are confirmed by numerical simulations and
we discuss possible measurement discrepancies in the fluctuation dissipation
relation which could arise due to this behavior.

on one hand to closed finite and even small systems and on the other to the
largest,self-gravitating ones. However, one has to reconsider the fundamental
principles of Statistical Mechanics especially its key quantity, entropy.
Whereas in conventional Thermostatistics the homogeneity and extensivity of the
system and the concavity of its entropy S(E) are central conditions, these fail
for the systems considered here. E.g. at phase separation the entropy S(E) is
necessarily convex to make e^{S(E)-E/T} bimodal in E (the two coexisting
phases). This is so even for normal macroscopic systems with short-range
coupling. As inhomogeneities and surface effects in particular cannot be scaled
away,one has to be careful with the standard arguments of splitting a system
into two or bringing two systems into thermal contact. Not only the volume part
of the entropy must be considered. When removing an external constraint in
regions of a negative heat capacity, the system may even relax under a flow of
heat (energy) against the temperature slope. Thus Clausius formulation of the
Second Law: ""Heat always flows from hot to cold"" can be violated. Temperature
is not a necessary or fundamental control parameter of Thermostatistics. In the
final sections of this paper the general microscopic mechanism leading to
condensation and to the convexity of the microcanonical entropy S(E) at phase
separation is sketched. Also the microscopic conditions for the existence or
non-existence of a critical end-point of the phase-separation are discussed.
This is explained for the liquid--gas and the solid--liquid transition.

features characterized by $1/f$ scaling and long-range power-law correlations,
suggesting a possibly common control mechanism. Specifically, it has been
suggested that dynamical processes influenced by inputs and feedback on
multiple time scales may be sufficient to give rise to $1/f$ scaling and scale
invariance. Two examples of physiologic signals that are the output of
hierarchical, multi-scale physiologic systems under neural control are the
human heartbeat and human gait. Here we show that while both cardiac interbeat
interval and gait interstride interval time series under healthy conditions
have comparable $1/f$ scaling, they still may belong to different complexity
classes. Our analysis of the magnitude series correlations and multifractal
scaling exponents of the fluctuations in these two signals demonstrates that in
contrast with the nonlinear multifractal behavior found in healthy heartbeat
dynamics, gait time series exhibit less complex, close to monofractal behavior
and a low degree of nonlinearity. These findings are of interest because they
underscore the limitations of traditional two-point correlation methods in
fully characterizing physiologic and physical dynamics. In addition, these
results suggest that different mechanisms of control may be responsible for
varying levels of complexity observed in physiological systems under neural
regulation and in physical systems that possess similar $1/f$ scaling.

facts, approaches, tools and observational evidence which conform modern
cosmology. The aim is also to try to complement the many excellent treatises
that exists on the subject (an exhaustive treatment being in any case
impossible for lack of time, in the lectures, and of space here), instead of
trying to cover everything in a telegraphic way. We start by recalling in the
introduction a couple of philosophical questions that have always upset
inquiring minds. We then present some original mathematical approaches to
investigate a number of basic questions, as the comparison of two point
distributions (each point corresponding to a galaxy or galaxy cluster), the use
of non-standard statistics in the analysis of possible non-Gaussianities, and
the use of zeta regularization in the study of the contributions of vacuum
energy effects at the cosmological scale. And we also summarize a number of
important issues which are both undoubtedly beautiful (from the physical
viewpoint) and useful in present-day observational cosmology. To finish, the
reader should be warned that, for the reasons already given and lack of space,
some fundamental issues, as inflation, quantum gravity and string theoretical
fundamental approaches to cosmology will not be dealt with here. A minimal
treatment of any of them would consume more pages than the ones at disposal
and, again, a number of excellent treatments of these subjects are available.

oscillations are explored within the context of modified dispersion relations

Grounding on these expressions, it is pointed out that, in general, even those
deviations that are suppressed by the second power of the Planck energy may be
observable for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, provided they originate at
cosmological distances. In fact, for neutrinos in the highest energy range of
EeV to ZeV, deviations that are suppressed by as much as the seventh power of
the Planck energy may become observable. Accordingly, realistic possibilities
of experimentally verifying these deviations by means of the next generation
neutrino detectors--such as IceCube and ANITA--are investigated.

radiation-pressure effects. We apply the general solution of the coupling

laser-interferometer topology of the gravitational-wave detector GEO600 and the
power-recycling, signal-extraction topology of advanced LIGO. We show that the
input-output relation exhibits a bright-port dark-port coupling. This mechanism
is responsible for bright-port contributions to the noise density of the output

sensitivity at low frequencies. It is shown quantitatively that the issue of
technical laser noise is unimportant in this context if the interferometer

model building of Split Supersymmetry compared with traditional low-scale
supersymmetry. We show how the mass spectrum of Split Supersymmetry naturally
emerges from theories where the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking
preserves an $R$ symmetry, characterize the class of theories where the
unavoidable $R$-breaking by gravity can be neglected, and point out a new
possibility, where supersymmetry breaking is directly communicated at tree
level to the visible sector via renormalizable interactions. Next, we discuss
possible low-energy signals for Split Supersymmetry. The absence of new light
scalars removes all the phenomenological difficulties of low-energy
supersymmetry, associated with one-loop flavor and CP violating effects.
However, the electric dipole moments of leptons and quarks do arise at two
loops, and are automatically at the level of present limits with no need for
small phases, making them accessible to several ongoing new-generation
experiments. We also study proton decay in the context of Split Supersymmetry,
and point out scenarios where the dimension-six induced decays may be
observable. Finally, we show that the novel spectrum of Split Supersymmetry
opens up new possibilities for the generation of dark matter, as the decays of
ultraheavy gravitinos in the early universe typically increase the abundance of
the lightest neutralino above its usual freeze-out value. This allows for
lighter gauginos and Higgsinos, more accessible both to the LHC and to
dark-matter detection experiments.

understanding of the nonequilibrium time evolution of quantum fields. Important
topical applications, in particular in high energy particle physics and
cosmology, involve dynamics of quantum fields far away from the ground state or
thermal equilibrium. In these cases, standard approaches based on small
deviations from equilibrium, or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying
kinetic descriptions, are not applicable. A particular challenge is to connect
the far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal
equilibrium at late times. Understanding the ``link'' between the early- and
the late-time behavior of quantum fields is crucial for a wide range of
phenomena. For the first time questions such as the explosive particle
production at the end of the inflationary universe, including the subsequent
process of thermalization, can be addressed in quantum field theory from first
principles. The progress in this field is based on efficient functional
integral techniques, so-called n-particle irreducible effective actions, for
which powerful nonperturbative approximation schemes are available. Here we
give an introduction to these techniques and show how they can be applied in
practice. Though we focus on particle physics and cosmology applications, we
emphasize that these techniques can be equally applied to other nonequilibrium
phenomena in complex many body systems.

in the frame of R-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model is
studied. We take the R-parity violating processes $e^+e^-\to e^{\mp}\mu^{\pm}$
as signal, and define the summation of the two processes as ``experiment''
observable. We find that the cross-section summation can reach
$\cal{O}$$(10^1)fb$ in the parameter space without sneutrino resonance
effect($\sqrt{s} \sim m_{\tilde{\nu}}$). The summation treatment manifests
uniform differential distribution on $\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ denotes the
polar angles of both outgoing $e^+/e^-$ respectively to incoming electron beam
in two signal processes. The uniform feature together with $e\mu$ collinearity
would help to reduce the SM background dramatically. Consequently we conclude
that at a $500 GeV$ LC with $480 fb^{-1}$ annual luminosity, it's either
possible to detect the distinctive R-violating LFV $e\mu$ signal, or exclude
sneutrino to $m_{\tilde{\nu}}>1.1 TeV$ at 95% CL in the machine's biennial

a model in which a new scalar gauge coupling is naturally introduced. Because
of the existence of production and annihilation for particles in quantum field
theory, we extend the number of independent variables from conventional four
space-time dimensions to five ones in order to describe all degrees of freedom
for field functions while the conventional space-time is still retained to be
the background. The potential fifth variable is nothing but the proper time of
particles. In response, a mass operator $(\hat{m}=-i\hbar
\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau})$ should be introduced. After that, the
lagrangian for free fermion fields in terms of five independent variables and
mass operator is written down. By applying the gauge principle, three kinds of
vector gauge couplings and one kind of scalar gauge coupling are naturally
introduced. In the current scenario, the mass spectrum for all fundamental
particles is accounted for in principle by solving the eigenvalue of mass
operator under the function of all kinds of interactions. Moreover, there no
any auxiliary mechanism including spontaneous symmetry breaking get involved in
the model. Therefore, traditional problems in the standard model such as the
vacuum energy problem are removed from our model, as well as the hierarchy
problem on the mass spectrum for fundamental particles.

Some non-perturbative conditions are already known in Type I theories; we
review these and search for others. We focus principally on possible anomalies
in discrete symmetries. It is generally believed that discrete symmetries in
string theories are gauge symmetries, so anomalies would provide evidence for
inconsistencies. Using the orbifold cosmic string construction, we give some
evidence that the symmetries we study are gauged. We then search for anomalies
in discrete symmetries in a variety of models, both with and without
supersymmetry. In symmetric orbifold models we extend previous searches, and
show in a variety of examples that all anomalies may be canceled by a
Green-Schwarz mechanism. We explore some asymmetric orbifold constructions and
again find that all anomalies may be canceled this way. Then we turn to Type
IIB orientifold models where it is known that even perturbative anomalies are
non-universal. In the examples we study, by combining geometric discrete
symmetries with continuous gauge symmetries, one may define non-anomalous
discrete symmetries already in perturbation theory; in other cases, the
anomalies are universal. Finally, we turn to the question of CPT conservation
in string/M theory. It is well known that CPT is conserved in all string
perturbation expansions; here in a number of examples for which a

high energy physics effects on low energy data. When applied to time-dependent
backgrounds, EFT must be supplemented with initial conditions. In these
proceedings, I briefly describe such approach, especially in the case of
inflationary, almost-de Sitter backgrounds. I present certain self-consistency
constraints that bound the size of possible deviations of the initial state
from the standard thermal vacuum. I also estimate the maximum size of
non-Gaussianities due to a non-thermal initial state which is compatible with
all bounds. These non-Gaussianities can be much larger than those due to
nonlinearities in the action describing single-scalar slow roll inflation

a wide range of models and modifications to gravity. Cosmological scaling
solutions in any of these theories are privileged because they represent
natural backgrounds relevant to dark energy. We study scaling solutions in a
generalized background $H^2 \propto \rho_T^n$ in the presence of a scalar field
$\vp$ and a barotropic perfect fluid, where $H$ is a Hubble rate and $\rho_T$
is a total energy density. The condition for the existence of scaling solutions
restricts the form of Lagrangian to be $p=X^{1/n}g(Xe^{n\lambda \vp})$, where
$X=-g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \vp \partial_\nu \vp /2$ and $g$ is an arbitrary
function. This is very useful to find out scaling solutions and corresponding
scalar-field potentials in a broad class of dark energy models including
(coupled)-quintessence, ghost-type scalar field, tachyon and k-essence. We
analytically derive the scalar-field equation of state $w_\vp$ and the
fractional density $\Omega_\vp$ and apply it to a number of dark energy models.

using the double-bosonisation construction of Majid. This construction
expresses algebraically the induction process given by adding and removing
nodes in Dynkin diagrams, which we call Lie induction.

structures in the case of the deletion of a single node from the Dynkin diagram
for a simple Lie (bi-)algebra.

some necessary conditions for the simplicity of the induced algebra. Finally,
we apply these to the exceptional series of simple Lie algebras, in the context
of finding obstructions to the existence of finite-dimensional simple complex
algebras of types E9, F5 and G3. In particular, our methods give a new point of
view on why there cannot exist such an algebra of type E9.

  cubic-quintic media","10 pages, 11 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.71.026615",,"nlin.PS",,"  We demonstrate that two-dimensional two-component bright solitons of an
annular shape, carrying vorticities $(m,\pm m)$ in the components, may be
stable in media with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity, including the
\textit{hidden-vorticity} (HV) solitons of the type $(m,-m)$, whose net
vorticity is zero. Stability regions for the vortices of both $(m,\pm m)$ types
are identified for $m=1$, 2, and 3, by dint of the calculation of stability
eigenvalues, and in direct simulations. A novel feature found in the study of
the HV solitons is that their stability intervals never reach the (cutoff)
point at which the bright vortex carries over into a dark one, hence dark HV
solitons can never be stable, contrarily to the bright ones. In addition to the
well-known symmetry-breaking (\textit{external}) instability, which splits the
ring soliton into a set of fragments flying away in tangential directions, we
report two new scenarios of the development of weak instabilities specific to
the HV solitons. One features \textit{charge flipping}, with the two components
exchanging the angular momentum and periodically reversing the sign of their
spins. The composite soliton does not split in this case, therefore we identify
such instability as an \textit{intrinsic} one. Eventually, the soliton splits,
as weak radiation loss drives it across the border of the ordinary strong
(external) instability. Another scenario proceeds through separation of the
vortex cores in the two components, each individual core moving toward the
outer edge of the annular soliton. After expulsion of the cores, there remains
a zero-vorticity breather with persistent internal vibrations.

through the ring. We find that a non-zero twist can improve communication
through finite odd numbered rings and enable high fidelity multi-party quantum
communication through spin rings (working near perfectly for rings of 5 and 7
spins). We show that in certain cases, the twist results in the complete
blockage of quantum information flow to a certain site of the ring. This effect
can be exploited to interface and entangle a flux qubit and a spin qubit
without embedding the latter in a magnetic field.

multi-partite Hamiltonian. This is known to be an important primitive in
quantum information processing and several schemes have been presented in the
literature to achieve this task. A method to construct decoupling schemes for
quantum systems of pairwise interacting qubits was introduced by M.
Stollsteimer and G. Mahler and is based on orthogonal arrays. Another approach
based on triples of Hadamard matrices that are closed under pointwise
multiplication was proposed by D. Leung. In this paper, we show that both
methods lead to the same class of decoupling schemes. Moreover, we establish a
characterization of orthogonal arrays by showing that they are equivalent to
decoupling schemes which allow a refinement into equidistant time-slots.
Furthermore, we show that decoupling schemes for networks of higher-dimensional
quantum systems with t-local Hamiltonians can be constructed from classical
error-correcting codes.

method approaches solution of the Riccati equation (obtained by casting the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation in a nonlinear form) by approximating the nonlinear
terms by a sequence of the linear ones, and is not based on the existence of a
smallness parameter. Each p-th QLM iterate is expressible in a closed integral
form. Its expansion in powers of $\hbar$ reproduces the structure of the WKB
series generating an infinite number of the WKB terms. Coefficients of the
first $2^p$ terms of the expansion are exact while coefficients of a similar
number of the next terms are approximate. The quantization condition in any QLM
iteration, including the first, leads to exact energies for many well known
physical potentials such as the Coulomb, harmonic oscillator,

may be a fruitful assumption from which we may develop a new approach of
statistical thermodynamics in pre-relativistic conditions. The discreetness of
space-time structure is determined by a condition that mimics the Heisenberg
uncertainty relations and the motion in this space-time model is chosen as
simple as possible. From these two assumptions we define a path-entropy that
measures the number of closed paths associated with a given energy of the
system preparation. This entropy has a dynamical character and depends on the
time interval on which we count the paths. We show that it exists an
like-equilibrium condition for which the path-entropy corresponds exactly to
the usual thermodynamic entropy and, more generally, the usual statistical
thermodynamics is reobtained. This result derived without using the Gibbs
ensemble method shows that the standard thermodynamics is consistent with a
motion that is time-irreversible at a microscopic level. From this change of
paradigm it becomes easy to derive a $H-theorem$. A comparison with the
traditional Boltzmann approach is presented. We also show how our approach can
be implemented in order to describe reversible processes. By considering a
process defined simultaneously by initial and final conditions a well defined
stochastic process is introduced and we are able to derive a Schroedinger
equation, an example of time reversible equation.

three-dimensional space onto a curved surface is normally derived in the hard
constraint $q \to 0$ limit, with $q$ the degree of freedom normal to the
surface. In this work the hard constraint is relaxed, and eigenvalues and wave
functions are numerically determined for a particle confined to a thin layer in
the neighborhood of a toroidal surface. The hard constraint and finite layer
(or soft constraint) quantities are comparable, but both differ markedly from
those of the corresponding two dimensional system, indicating that the
curvature potential continues to influence the dynamics when the particle is
confined to a finite layer. This effect is potentially of consequence to the
modelling of curved nanostructures.
