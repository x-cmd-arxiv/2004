compared to models of thin disc accretion to their black holes at the Bondi
rate, typically a few hundredths to a few tenths of a solar mass per year. This
has motivated models of inefficiently-radiated accretion that invoke weak
electron-ion thermal coupling, and/or inhibited accretion rates due to
convection or outflows. Here we point out that even if such processes are
operating, a significant fraction of the accreting gas is prevented from
reaching the central black hole because it condenses into stars in a
gravitationally unstable disc. Star formation occurs inside the Bondi radius
(typically ~100pc in giant ellipticals), but still relatively far from the
black hole in terms of Schwarzschild radii. Star formation depletes and heats
the gas disc, eventually leading to a marginally stable, but much reduced,
accretion flow to the black hole. We predict the presence of cold (~100K),
dusty gas discs, containing clustered H-alpha emission and occasional type II
supernovae, both resulting from the presence of massive stars. Star formation
accounts for several features of the M87 system: a thin disc, traced by H-alpha
emission, is observed on scales of about 100pc, with features reminiscent of
spiral arms and dust lanes; the star formation rate inferred from the intensity
of H-alpha emission is consistent with the Bondi accretion rate of the system.
Star formation may therefore help suppress accretion onto the central engines
of massive ellipticals. We also discuss some implications for the fueling of
the Galactic center and quasars.

change the evolution of the bias parameter compared to an interaction-free

fundamental interaction parameters between galaxy populations, possibly giving

assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black
hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that
regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers
nuclear gas inflow which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole
accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN
feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short
timescale,particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive
powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of
the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black
holes. Without AGN, gas-rich mergers lead to ellipticals which remain blue
owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyrs have elapsed. In
contrast, mergers with black holes produce ellipticals that redden much faster,
an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete
termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r ~ 2.3 in
less than one Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population
of extremely red massive early type-galaxies, and it appears to be an important
driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the

from H-alpha. Different models based on dust extinction from dust in the ejecta

more likely to arise as a result of optical depth effects in the narrow, cool,

ultraviolet lines of SN 1993J are broad, with a box-like shape, coming from the

sufficiently rapidly are secularly unstable to nonaxisymmetric, bar-mode

energy dissipation by viscosity can drive an unstable spheroid to a stable,
triaxial configuration of lower energy - a Jacobi ellipsoid. But what about
rapidly rotating compressible stars? Unlike incompressible stars, which contain
no internal energy and therefore immediately liberate all the energy dissipated
by viscosity, compressible stars have internal energy and can retain the
dissipated energy as internal heat. Now compressible stars that rotate
sufficiently rapidly and also manage to liberate this dissipated energy very
quickly are known to be unstable to bar-mode perturbations, like their
incompressible counterparts. But what is the situation for rapidly rotating
compressible stars that have very long cooling timescales, so that all the
energy dissipated by viscosity is retained as heat, whereby the total energy of
the star remains constant on a secular (viscous) evolution timescale? Are such
stars also unstable to the nonlinear growth of bar modes, or is the viscous
heating sufficient to cause them to expand, drive down the ratio of rotational
kinetic to gravitational potential energy T/|W| ~ 1/R, where R is the
equatorial radius, and turn off the instability before it gets underway? If the
instability still arises in such stars, at what rotation rate do they become
unstable, and to what final state do they evolve? We provide answers to these

increases with decreasing P. We examine the confrontation between RV and TR
survey results, paying particular attention to selection biases that favor
short-period planets in transit surveys. We demonstrate that, when such biases
and small-number statistics are properly taken into account, the period
distribution of planets found by RV and TR surveys are consistent at better
than the 1-sigma level. This consistency holds for a large range of reasonable
assumptions. In other words, there are not enough planets detected to robustly
conclude that the RV and TR short-period planet results are inconsistent.
Assuming a logarithmic distribution of periods, we find that the relative

10-20%. Given an absolute frequency of HJ of ~1%, this implies that
approximately one star in ~500-1000 has a VHJ. We also note that VHJ and HJ

emission drives convection in a hot bubble of radiation, nucleons, and pairs
just outside a proto-neutron star. Shortly thereafter, neutrinos drive a
wind-like outflow from the neutron star. In both the convective bubble and the
early wind, weak interactions temporarily cause a proton excess (Ye > 0.5) to
develop in the ejected matter. This situation lasts for at least the first
second, and the approximately 0.05 - 0.1 solar masses that is ejected has an
unusual composition that may be important for nucleosynthesis. Using tracer
particles to follow the conditions in a two-dimensional model of a successful
supernova explosion calculated by Janka, Buras & Rampp (2003), we determine the
composition of this material. Most of it is helium and 56Ni. The rest is
relatively rare species produced by the decay of proton-rich isotopes unstable
to positron emission. In the absence of pronounced charged-current neutrino
capture, nuclear flow will be held up by long-lived waiting point nuclei in the

interesting rare isotopes like 45Sc, 49Ti, and 64Zn. The present calculations
imply yields that, when compared with the production of major species in the

abundance of 45Sc and 49Ti. Since the synthesis will be nearly the same in
stars of high and low metallicity, the primary production of these species may
have discernible signatures in the abundances of low metallicity stars. We also

luminous (cz = 1465 km/s, L = 0.5L*) starburst galaxy with a moderate star
formation rate of 1.4 Solar masses per year. The UV spectra show that the Si IV
and C IV doublets have the same three velocity components at cz = 1369, 1417,
and 1530 km/s found in Ca II H & K, Na I D, Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II, implying
that the low and high ionization gas are both found in three distinct absorbing
clouds (only the strongest component at 1420 km/s is detected in H I 21 cm).
The new Lyman alpha observation allows the first measurements of the spin and
kinetic temperatures of halo gas: T_s = 435 +/- 140 K and T_k/T_s ~ 1. However,
while a standard photoionization model can explain the low ions, the C IV and
Si IV are explained more easily as collisionally-ionized boundary layers of the
photoionized clouds. Due to their small inferred space velocity offsets (-260,
-130, and +170 km/s) relative to the nucleus of NGC 3067 and the spatial
coincidence of low and high ionization gas, we propose that these absorbers are
analogous to Galactic high velocity clouds (HVCs). A comparison of the NGC 3067
clouds and Galactic HVCs finds similar H I column densities, kinematics,
metallicities, spin temperatures, and inferred sizes. We find no compelling
evidence that any halo gas along this sightline is escaping the gravitational
potential of NGC 3067, despite its modest starburst.

supercooled liquids in recent years with computer simulation studies exploring
the whole frequency range of relaxation. The simulation studies can thus
supplement the existing experimental results to provide an insight into the
energy landscape dynamics. We here investigate a kinetic model of cooperative
dynamics within the landscape paradigm for the dynamic heat capacity behavior.
In this picture, the beta-process is modeled as a thermally activated event in
a two-level system and the alpha-process is described as a beta-relaxation
mediated cooperative transition in a double well. The model provides a
description of the activated hopping in the energy landscape in close relation
with the cooperative nature of the hopping event. For suitable choice of
parameters, the model predicts a frequency dependent heat capacity that
reflects the two-step relaxation behavior. Although experimentally obtained
specific heat spectra of supercooled liquids till date could not capture the
two-step relaxation behavior, this has been observed in a computer simulation
study by Scheidler et. al. [Phys. Rev. B 63, 104204 (2001)]. The temperature
dependence of the position of the low-frequency peak, due to the
alpha-relaxation, shows a non-Arrhenius behavior as observed experimentally by
Birge and Nagel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 54, 2674 (1985)]. The shape of the alpha-peak
is, however, found to be temperature independent, in agreement with the
simulation result. The high-frequency peak appears with considerably larger
amplitude than the alpha-peak. We attempt a plausible reason for this

requires a first order transition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting

antiferromagnet phase boundary has a tricritical point, with the transition
being first order in the vicinity of the superconducting phase. We propose that
this phase diagram explains coexistence regions between the superconducting and

the SO(4) symmetry predicts the existence of a mixed phase of

strongly from ordinary superconductors. The nuclear magnetic response shows an
anomalous anisotropy due to the broken time-reversal symmetry of the

of lattice inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase leads to
anomalous coherence factors in the optical conductivity and to the appearance

between quasi-free electrons which is induced by an exchange interaction with

characteristic temperature T* and is manifest in the opening of a pseudogap in
the density of states of the electrons. The variation of T* is examined here as
a function of (i) the typical frequency \omega_0 of the local lattice modes,
which determines the binding energy of the bipolarons, and (ii) the doping,
which amounts to a relative change of the bipolaron concentration n_B to that
of the free electrons n_F. We concentrate on a doping regime, where small
changes in doping give rise to a large change in T*, which is the case when n_B
is small (< 0.1 per site). For finite values of n_B we find negative and
practically doping independent values of the isotope coefficient \alpha^* which
characterizes the formation of resonating electron pairs. Upon decreasing the
total particle density such that n_B becomes exponentially small, we find a
rapid change in sign of \alpha^*. This is related to the fact that the system
approaches a state which is more BCS-like, where electron pairing occurs via
virtual excitations into bipolaronic states and where T* coincides with the

evolve by probabilistic local rules. In each update, groups of various sizes k
are formed according to some probability distribution {a_k}. Given a specific
group with an initial (j) agents sharing opinion {+} and (k-j) agents opinion
{-}, all k members adopt opinion {+} with a probability m_{k,j} and opinion {-}
with (1-m_{k,j}). A very rich and new spectrum of dynamics is obtained. The
final opinion is a polarization along the initial majority, along the initial
minority or a perfect consensus with an equality of opinions as function of the
parameters {a_k, m_{k,j}}. In last case, two regimes exist, monotonic and
dampened oscillatory. The transition from polarization to consensus dynamics
occurs for values of the parameters which reproduce exactly the Voter model. A
scheme is presented to express any local update in terms of a specific set
{a_k, m_{k,j}}. Most existing opinion models are exhibited at particular

importance. Whether preventing unauthorized access to personal photographs,
ensuring compliance with federal regulations, or ensuring the integrity of

from talented intruders. Specifically, as more and more files are preserved on
disk the requirement to provide secure storage has increased in importance.
This paper presents a survey of techniques for securely storing data, including
theoretical approaches, prototype systems, and existing systems currently
available. Due to the wide variety of potential solutions available and the
variety of techniques to arrive at a particular solution, it is important to
review the entire field prior to selecting an implementation that satisfies
particular requirements. This paper provides an overview of the prominent
characteristics of several systems to provide a foundation for making an
informed decision. Initially, the paper establishes a set of criteria for
evaluating a storage solution based on confidentiality, integrity,
availability, and performance. Then, using these criteria, the paper explains
the relevant characteristics of select storage systems and provides a
comparison of the major differences.

  In this article I examine the Dirac field coupled to 1/R gravity. The Dirac
action contains the connection which was taken to be the Christoffel symbol,
not an independent quantity, in the papers by Flanagan. Since the metric and

to allow the connection that appears in the Dirac action to be an independent
quantity. This is the approach that is taken in this paper. The resulting
theory is very different and much more complicated than the one discussed in

  Physics",,,,"math-ph gr-qc math.DG math.MP",,"  In this paper a thorough study of the normal form and the first integrability
conditions arising from {\em bi-conformal vector fields} is presented. These
new symmetry transformations were introduced in {\em Class. Quantum
Grav.}\textbf{21}, 2153-2177 and some of their basic properties were addressed
there. Bi-conformal vector fields are defined on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold
through the differential conditions $\lie P_{ab}=\phi P_{ab}$ and
$\lie\Pi_{ab}=\chi\Pi_{ab}$ where $P_{ab}$ and $\Pi_{ab}$ are orthogonal and
complementary projectors with respect to the metric tensor $\rmg_{ab}$. One of
the main results of our study is the discovery of a new geometric
characterization of {\em conformally separable spaces with conformally flat
leaf metrics} similar to the vanishing of the Weyl tensor for conformally flat
metrics. This geometric characterization seems to carry over to any
pseudo-Riemannian manifold admitting conformally flat foliations which would
open the door to the systematic searching of these type of foliations in a
given pseudo-Riemannian metric. Other relevant aspects such as the existence of
invariant tensors under the finite groups generated by these transformations

challenge. We introduce a simple procedure, based on known properties of
physical electronic densities, to make the variance of the Hellmann-Feynman
estimator finite. We obtain very accurate geometries for the molecules H$_2$,
LiH, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$O and HF, with a Slater-Jastrow trial wave function.
Harmonic frequencies for diatomics are also in good agreement with experiment.
An antithetical sampling method is also discussed for additional reduction of
the variance.

Kolmogorov complexity adversary (Laplante and Magniez, 2004). We also pa few

_one_ quantum adversary method. From our approach, all known limitations of
these versions of the quantum adversary method easily follow.

  Symposium in Honor of Jean-Pierre Vigier (Paris, September, 2003). Kluwer
  Academic Publishers",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We make a brief review of the Kramers escape rate theory for the
probabilistic motion of a particle in a potential well U(x), and under the
influence of classical fluctuation forces. The Kramers theory is extended in
order to take into account the action of the thermal and zero-point random
electromagnetic fields on a charged particle. The result is physically relevant
because we get a non null escape rate over the potential barrier at low
temperatures (T -> 0). It is found that, even if the mean energy is much
smaller than the barrier height, the classical particle can escape from the
potential well due to the action of the zero-point fluctuating fields. These
stochastic effects can be used to give a classical interpretation to some
quantum tunneling phenomena. Relevant experimental data are used to illustrate
the theoretical results.

the quantum information carried by an arbitrary state of the electronic spin

With an appropriate external control, the stored quantum state in quantum
memory can be read out reversibly. We also explore in detail the quantum
decoherence mechanism due to the inhomogeneous couplings between the electronic
spin and the nuclear spins.
