flux is driven by Parker-type gas pressure gradients, and what fraction is
driven by, e.g., wave-particle interactions or turbulence. SOHO has been
pivotal in bringing these ideas back to the forefront of coronal and solar wind
research. This paper reviews our current understanding of coronal heating in
the context of the acceleration of the fast and slow solar wind. For the fast
solar wind, a recent model of Alfven wave generation, propagation, and non-WKB
reflection is presented and compared with UVCS, SUMER, radio, and in-situ
observations at the last solar minimum. The derived fractions of energy and
momentum addition from thermal and nonthermal processes are found to be
consistent with various sets of observational data. For the more chaotic slow
solar wind, the relative roles of steady streamer-edge flows (as emphasized by
UVCS abundance analysis) versus bright blob structures (seen by LASCO) need to
be understood before the relation between streamer heating and and slow-wind

the need for next-generation remote-sensing observations that can supply the

obtain spectra of extrasolar planets. The method makes use of the wavelength
dependence of the interferometer phase of the planet/star system, which depends
both on the interferometer geometry and on the brightness ratio between the
planet and the star. The differential phase is strongly affected by
instrumental and atmospheric dispersion effects. Difficulties in calibrating
these effects might prevent the application of the differential phase method to
systems with a very high contrast, such as extrasolar planets. A promising
alternative is the use of spectrally resolved closure phases, which are immune
to many of the systematic and random errors affecting the single-baseline
phases. We have modeled the response of the AMBER instrument at the VLTI to
realistic models of known extrasolar planetary systems, taking into account
their theoretical spectra as well as the geometry of the VLTI. We present a
strategy to determine the geometry of the planetary system and the spectrum of
the extrasolar planet from closure phase observations in two steps. We show
that there is a close relation between the nulls in the closure phase and the
nulls in the corresponding single-baseline phases: every second null of a
single-baseline phase is also a null in the closure phase. In particular, the
nulls in the closure phase do not depend on the spectrum but only on the
geometry. Therefore the geometry of the system can be determined by measuring
the nulls in the closure phase, and braking the remaining ambiguity due to the
unknown system orientation by means of observations at different hour angles.
Based on the known geometry, the planet spectrum can then be directly
synthesized from the closure phases.

(IGM) is one of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics. The accretion of
gas onto galaxies provides fuel for star formation, while galactic winds
transform the nearby IGM in a number of ways. One exciting technique to study
this gas is through the imaging of hydrogen Lyman-alpha emission. We use
cosmological simulations to study the Lyman-alpha signals expected from the
growth of cosmic structure from z=0-5. We show that if dust absorption is
negligible, recombinations following the absorption of stellar ionizing photons
dominate the total Lyman-alpha photon production rate. However, galaxies are
also surrounded by ""Lyman-alpha coronae"" of diffuse IGM gas. These coronae are
composed of a combination of accreting gas and material ejected from the
central galaxy by winds. The Lyman-alpha emission from this phase is powered by
a combination of gravitational processes and the photoionizing background.
While the former dominates at z~0, collisional excitation following
photo-heating may well dominate the total emission at higher redshifts. The
central regions of these systems are dense enough to shield themselves from the
metagalactic ionizing background; unfortunately, in this regime our simulations
are no longer reliable. We therefore consider several scenarios for the
emission from the central cores, including one in which self-shielded gas does
not emit at all. We show that the combination of star formation and cooling IGM
gas can explain most of the observed ""Lyman-alpha blobs"" at z~3, with the
important exception of the largest sources. On the other hand, except under the
most optimistic assumptions, cooling IGM gas cannot explain the observations on

meridional component B-star of the magnetic field at the stellar surface must
be larger than a minimum value B-star-min. The radial extent of the Keplerian
region will be larger when B-star is larger or when viscosity plays a role. In

one-third of the total HI radius and one-half the optically-defined Holmberg

central depression in the HI distribution, so it may be a shell formed by a
starburst episode. However, the UBV colors in the HI hole are not bluer than
the rest of the galaxy as would be expected if an unusual star-forming event
had taken place there recently, but there is an old (~1-3 Gyr), red cluster
near the center of the hole that is massive enough to have produced the hole in
the HI. An age estimate for the ring, however, is uncertain because it is not
observed to be expanding. An expansion model produces a lower estimate of 0.5
Gyr, but the presence of faint star formation regions associated with the ring
indicate a much younger age. We also estimate that the ring could have
dispersed by now if it is older than 0.5 Gyr. This implies that the ring is
younger than 0.5 Gyr. A younger age would indicate that the red cluster did not
produce the hole and ring. If this ring and the depression in the gas which it
surrounds were not formed by stellar winds and supernovae, this would indicate
that some other, currently unidentified, mechanism is operating.

study of Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) Galaxies in the Near Infrared (NIR). Compared
to the visible light, NIR data allow a better separation of the starburst
emission from the light distribution of the old stellar low-surface brightness
(LSB) host galaxy. We analyze deep NIR broad band images of a sample of 11
BCDs, observed with the Calar Alto 3.6m telescope. This work enlarges the
samples presented in preceding papers of this study (Noeske et al. 2003, Cairos
et al. 2003) by BCDs of the most common morphological type, displaying a
regular elliptical LSB host galaxy. The data presented here allow the detection
and quantitative study of the extended stellar LSB host galaxy in all sample
BCDs. The NIR surface brightness profiles (SBPs) of the LSB host galaxies agree
at large galactocentric radii with those from optical studies, showing also an
exponential intensity decrease and compatible scale lengths. Similar to Noeske
et al. (2003), we find centrally flattening exponential (type V) SBPs of the
host galaxy for several BCDs. Such SBPs remain mostly undetected in optical
bands, due to the comparatively stronger starburst emission at these
wavelengths. We apply a modified exponential distribution to decompose and
quantitatively analyze SBPs of LSB hosts with a type V intensity distribution.
We present the results of the surface photometry and the decomposition of SBPs,
and discuss individual objects with respect to morphological details of their
star-forming regions.

members on the basis of Li I absorption, weak Na I features and radial
velocities. Photometric selection alone therefore appears to be very effective
in identifying cluster members in this mass range. Only 6 objects appear to be
certain non-members, however a substantial subset of 13 have ambiguous or
contradictory indications of membership and lack Li absorption. Four candidate
binary cluster members are identified. Consideration of sampling and precision
leads us to conclude that either the fraction of very low mass stars and brown
dwarfs in small separation (a<1au) binary systems is larger than in field
M-dwarfs, or the distribution of separations is much less skewed towards large
separations. This conclusion hinges critically on the correct identification of
the small number of binary candidates, but is significant even when only
Li-rich candidate members are considered. Broadened H alpha emission,
indicative of circum(sub)stellar accretion discs is found in 5 or 6 of the
candidate cluster members, 3 of which probably have substellar masses. The
fraction of accretors (10+/-5 per cent) is similar to that found in stars of
higher mass in the cluster using H alpha emission as a diagnostic, but much
lower than found for very low mass stars and brown dwarfs of younger clusters.
The timescale for accretion rates to drop to less than 10^{-11} M_sun/yr is
hence less than the age of the Sigma Ori cluster (3 to 7 Myr) for most low-mass
objects (abridged).

narrow-band images to determine the velocity shifts and dispersions of the

Many knots are spatially resolved with sizes of tenths of arcsecs,
corresponding to tens of pcs, and yet they appear to move coherently with
radial velocities between zero and +/- 1200 km/s with respect to the systemic
velocities of their hostgalaxies. The knots also show a broad range in velocity
dispersion, ranging from ~30 km/s (the velocity resolution) to ~1000 km/s FWHM.
Most of the Seyfert galaxies in this sample show an organized flow pattern,
with radial velocities near zero at the nucleus (defined by the optical
continuum peak) and increasing to maximum blueshifts and redshifts within ~1''
of the nucleus, followed by a decline to the systemic velocity. The
emission-line knots also follow a general trend of decreasing velocity
dispersion with increasing distance. In the Seyfert 2 galaxies, the presence of
blueshifts and redshifts on either side of the nucleus indicates that rotation
alone cannot explain the observed radial velocities, and that radial outflow
plays an important role. Each of the Seyfert galaxies in this sample (with the
exception of Mrk 3) shows a bright, compact (FWHM < 0.5"") [O III] knot at the

detected at high confidence (>~ 7 sigma) in both fields. The amplitude of the

  additions",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This review provides the background and current perspective of some of the
striking asymmetries exhibited by extragalactic double-lobed radio sources,
paying special attention to the reported interrelationships among some of them.
We particularly aim to highlight some less discussed aspects pertaining to the
radio lobes and hot-spots for which any relativistic beaming effects are milder
than those imposed on the jets. Various attributes of these features, such as
their geometry, intensity, spectrum, and polarization provide important
underpinnings to models of radio galaxies and quasars, as well as to theories
that attempt to unify them. These contraints are sharpened by exploiting the
asymmetry properties of the extended optical emission-line regions associated
with powerful radio sources, including the giant halos of Lyman-alpha emission
associated with them. We suggest that highly extended disks of dusty gaseous
material, which could also be parts of cosmic filaments, around the host
galaxies of radio sources may hold the key to understanding the correlated
radio--optical asymmetry and perhaps also the depolarization asymmetry of the
twin radio lobes. We also discuss the nature and possible implications of the
extreme type of asymmetry witnessed in the enigmatic quasar 3C273, whose entire
radio emission is observed on just one side of the nucleus. In this context,
theoretical scenarios for the production of one-sided jets are also briefly
recounted. Taking a clue from theobserved one-sidedness of the extended radio
jets even in `weak-headed-quasars', we also propose a scenario for the late
evolutionary stage of double radio sources. We end with a list of key questions
concerning radio source asymmetries which still require final answers.

below Tc in the antiferromagnetic(AF) incommensurate spin excitation. In
Zn:y=0.004, the spin excitation shows a spin gap of 3meV below Tc. In
Zn:y=0.008 and Zn:y=0.011, however, the magnetic signals at 3meV decrease below
Tc and increase again at lower temperature, indicating an in-gap state. In
Zn:y=0.017, the low-energy spin state remains unchanged with decreasing
temperature, and elastic magnetic peaks appear below 20K then exponentially
increase. As for Ni:y=0.009 and Ni:y=0.018, the low-energy excitations below
3meV and 2meV disappear below Tc. The temperature dependence at 3meV, however,
shows no upturn in constrast with Zn:y=0.008 and Zn:y=0.011, indicating the
absence of in-gap state. In Ni:y=0.029, the magnetic signals were observed also
at 0meV. Thus the spin gap closes with increasing Ni. Furthermore, as omega
increases, the magnetic peak width broadens and the peak position, i.e.
incommensurability, shifts toward the magnetic zone center (pi pi). We
interpret the impurity effects as follows: Zn locally makes a
non-superconducting island exhibiting the in-gap state in the superconducting
sea with the spin gap. Zn reduces the superconducting volume fraction, thus
suppressing Tc. On the other hand, Ni primarily affects the superconducting
sea, and the spin excitations become more dispersive and broaden with
increasing energy, which is recognized as a consequence of the reduction of
energy scale of spin excitations. We believe that the reduction of energy scale
is relevant to the suppression of Tc.

the upper critical field of the superconducting transition. Together with the
results for field along the tetragonal axis (H//c), the emergent picture is
that of a magnetic field tuned quantum critical point which exists in the
vicinity of the superconducting H_{c2} despite a variation of a factor of 2.4
in H_{c2} for different field orientations. This suggests an underlying
physical reason exists for the superconducting H_{c2} to coincide with the
quantum critical field. Moreover, we show that the recovery of a Fermi Liquid
ground state with increasing magnetic field is more gradual, meaning that the
fluctuations responsible for the observed quantum critical phenomena are more
robust with respect to magnetic field, when the magnetic field is applied
in-plane. Together with the close proximity of the quantum critical point and
H_{c2} in CeCoIn_5 for both field orientation, the anisotropy in the recovery

Motivated by String Theory, the models of large extra dimensions predict a vast
number of new effects in the energy range of the lowered Planck scale, among
them the production of TeV-mass black holes and gravitons. But not only is the
Planck scale the energy scale at which effects of modified gravity become
important. String Theory as well as non-commutative quantum mechanics suggest
that the Planck length acts as a minimal length in nature, providing a natural
ultraviolet cutoff and a limit to the possible resolution of spacetime. Within
the extra dimensional scenario, the minimal length effects thus become
important in the same energy range in which the effective extra dimensional
models predict new physics. We examine a model which includes the minimal
length into the extra dimensional extension of the Standard Model.

rates by several orders relative to the SM predictions, the TC2 model predicts
much larger rates than other models; (2) The optimal channel for probing the

collision and can reach the detectable level for a large part of the parameter
space.

both on the scalar field and on spacetime prior to any spontaneous symmetry
breakdown in the electroweak model. First we argue that the local electroweak
gauge symmetry is implied by the initial SO(4) symmetry of the scalar field.
Then we parameterize the vacuum, in a slightly different way with respect to
the conventional assignment in the electroweak model, around the ground state
mainly in two different ways: Once over the local electroweak gauge
transformations and once over the local $\gamma$ basis which generates the
SO(4) symmetry of the scalar field. Through comparing the two, we conclude that
a consistent parametrization, requires the complexification of the scalar
field, which simultaneously requires spacetime to obey local Lorentz invariance
in the broken phase of the electroweak vacuum. After spontaneous symmetry
breakdown and complexification, the SO(3,1) invariant quantity of the scalar
field is identified to be the Higgs mass, which yields $m_H=v/2 \cong 123$ GeV.
Also the vacuum state is normalized to a unit state by rescaling the local
$\gamma$ basis, so that the metric tensor inherently contains the speed of
light in the Higgs vacuum. We shortly consider the validity of the SO(3,1)
invariance property of the vacuum state in terms of the Goldstone modes, in
case the Higgs field departs from the ground state. The main goal of the paper
is to treat spacetime and vacuum as the two faces of the same medallion, and to
relate the local spacetime symmetry with the electroweak gauge symmetry, both
in the broken and unbroken phases of the vacuum via complexification and
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

recent particle physics such as the gauge hierarchy problem. In order for such
approaches to be viable, a crucial ingredient is to fix the sizes of extra
dimensions at some finite values, which sizes are generically free parameters
in the theory. In this paper, we present several schemes to determine the
radius of extra dimension in warped five-dimensional theory. In every case, a
non-vanishing Fayet-Iliopoulos term for abelian gauge factor plays a crucial
role for the radius stabilization. It is radiatively generated in the presence
of charged matter fields and the compactification is therefore spontaneous, not
forced by selected operators. The low-energy supersymmetry is broken or
unbroken, and the radius can be fixed to give a small or large scale hierarchy
without any fine tuning of parameters. We also discuss a model of the radius
stabilization correlated with Yukawa hierarchy and supersymmetry breaking.

identify a macroscopic loop amplitude in the type I string theories which

the UV is realized as the world-volume theory of N D6-branes wrapped on S^3,

gives an equivalent version of this duality in which the UV is realized
geometrically in terms of an S^2 of A_{N-1} singularities, with one unit of RR

a single D6 brane on a lens space S^3/Z_N or, alternatively, a singular

localized at the singularities, an action of their stabilizer group in the U(1)

Concerning the gauge potential, it is composed of the pure MCS interaction
corrected by background contributions, also responsible for its anisotropic

sequence of approximations for an electromagnetic (EM) wave propagating
according to the nonlinear Maxwell equations (NLM). The dielectric medium is
assumed to be periodic, with a cubic nonlinearity, and with its linear
background possessing inversion symmetric dispersion relations. The medium is
excited by a current $\mathbf{J}$ producing an EM wave. The wave nonlinear
evolution is analyzed based on the modal decomposition and an expansion of the
exact solution to the NLM into an asymptotic series with respect to some three
small parameters $\alpha $, $\beta $ and $\varrho $. These parameters are
introduced through the excitation current $\mathbf{J}$ to scale respectively
(i) its amplitude and consequently the magnitude of the nonlinearity; (ii) the
range of wavevectors involved in its modal composition, with $\beta ^{-1}$
scaling its spatial extension; (iii) its frequency bandwidth, with $\varrho
^{-1}$ scaling its time extension. We develop a consistent theory of
approximations of increasing accuracy for the NLM with its first term governed
by the NLS. We show that such NLS regime is the medium response to an almost
monochromatic excitation current $\mathbf{J} $. The developed approach not only
provides rigorous estimates of the approximation accuracy of the NLM with the
NLS in terms of powers of $\alpha $, $\beta $ and $\varrho $, but it also
produces new extended NLS (ENLS) equations providing better approximations.
Remarkably, quantitative estimates show that properly tailored ENLS can
significantly improve the approximation accuracy of the NLM compare with the
classical NLS.

checking the largest triangle of the geodetical measurement campaign in the

physical space can be taken seriously or not. Among others, it was argued that
it even was logically impossible for Gauss to do so in the early 1820s (i.e. in
particular, before J. Bolyai's, N.I. Lobachevsy's, or even B. Riemann's works).
This article shows, in which sense Gauss's methodology of curvature of
surfaces, although logically developed in all clarity only for surfaces
embedded in Euclidean 3-space, could very well be used already in the early
1820 to investigate the above mentioned question in the sense of physical
geometry. Although we do not have a definitive proof of the respective
calculations by Gauss's own hand, the latter's account of the situation to
contemporaries (correspondents, friend and students) changed clearly between
the early and the late 1820s. That speaks very much in favour of a basic
correctness of Sartorius von Waltershausen's report on this topic.

history with many important applications in number theory and group theory. In
1989 Kleitman and Lemke, and independently Chung, proved a strengthening of a
number theoretic conjecture of Erdos and Lemke. Kleitman and Lemke then made
more general conjectures for finite groups, strengthening the requirements of
zero-sum sequences. In this paper we prove their conjecture in the case of
abelian groups. Namely, we use graph pebbling to prove that for every sequence
(g_k)_{k=1}^{|G|} of |G| elements of a finite abelian group G there is a
nonempty subsequence (g_k)_{k in K} such that sum_{k in K}g_k=0_G and sum_{k in
K}1/|g_k|\le 1, where |g| is the order of the element g in G.

discussed F.Gonseth's dialectical epistemology and considered it as being
restricted too strictly to aspects of historical change. His own experiences
with post-Kantian dialectical philosophy, in particular J.G. Fichte's
derivation of the concept of space and matter, had been a stronger dialectical
background for his own 1918 studies in purely infintitesimal geometry and the
early geometrically unified field theory of matter (extending the Mie-Hilbert
program). Although now Weyl distantiated himself from the speculative features
of his youthful philosophizing and in particular from his earlier enthusiasm
for Fichte, he again had deep doubts as to the cultural foundations of modern
mathematical sciences and its role in material culture of high modernity. For
Weyl, philosophical ""reflection"" was a cultural necessity; he now turned
towards K. Jasper's and M. Heidegger's existentialism to find deeper grounds,
similar to his turn towards Fichte's philosophy after World War I.

categorified vector space, or `2-vector space', which we define as an internal
category in Vect, the category of vector spaces. We then define a `semistrict
Lie 2-algebra' to be a 2-vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric bilinear
functor satisfying the Jacobi identity up to a completely antisymmetric
trilinear natural transformation called the `Jacobiator', which in turn must
satisfy a certain law of its own. Much of the content of this first chapter has
already appeared in a separate paper coauthored with John Baez, Higher
Dimensional Algebra VI: Lie 2-algebras.
  We then explore the relationship between Lie algebras and algebraic
structures called `quandles'. A quandle is a set equipped with two binary
operations satisfying axioms that capture the essential properties of the
operations of conjugation in a group and algebraically encode the three
Reidemeister moves. Indeed, we describe the relation to groups and show that
quandles give invariants of braids. We further show that both Lie algebras and
quandles give solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, and explain how
conjugation plays a prominent role in the both the theories of Lie algebras and
quandles. Inspired by these commonalities, we provide a novel, conceptual
passage from Lie groups to Lie algebras using the language of quandles.
Moreover, we propose relationships between higher Lie theory and
higher-dimensional braid theory. We conclude with evidence of this connection
by proving that any semistrict Lie 2-algebra gives a solution of the
Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation, which is the higher-dimensional analog of
the Yang--Baxter equation.

the elementary cross section by which one divides the residual to obtain a new

new scaling variable which is suited to the resonance region. This yields a
good representation of the electromagnetic response in both the quasielastic

propagating pulses of high-intensity high-energy particle beams in pre-existing
or self-generated plasmas. Consideration is given to beams of electrons,
protons, muons, and their antiparticles, as well as to neutral-hydrogen,
positronium, and electron-positron-plasmoid beams. The first part is a
systematic overview of the theory pertaining to propagation, plasma
self-generation, energy/current-losses, and stability of such pulses. The
second part reviews the major full-scale propagation experiments which have
been carried out, in atmospheric and outer-space plasmas, to assess the
validity of theoretical models. It is found that the data available on these
experiments demonstrate that range and stability are in agreement with theory.
In particular, stable self-pinched propagation of high-current charged-particle
beams in the atmosphere is possible over distances equal to several Nordsieck
lengths. In order not to be deflected by Earth's magnetic field, electron-beam
pulses need to be guided by a pre-formed channel, while proton-beam pulses may
under suitable conditions propagate undeflected through both the low- and
high-atmosphere. In ionospheric or outer-space plasmas, very-long-range
propagation across Earth's magnetic field requires GeV to TeV electrons or
positron beams in order for the transverse deflection to be acceptable, while
undeflected propagation is possible for plasmoid beams consisting of co-moving
high-energy particle pairs such as electrons and positrons.

Weyl developed independently from each other a general relativistic

theory by the introduction of a local (topologically trivial) spinor structures
and a lifting of the Levi-Civita connection of underlying space-time. They both
observed, in slightly different settings, a characteristic underdetermination
of the spin connection by a complex phase factor, which gave the symbolical
possibility for a reformulation of Weyl's old (1918) idea to characterize the
electromagnetic potential by a differential form transforming as a gauge field.
Weyl and Fock realized the common mathematical core of their respective
approaches in summer 1929, but insisted on differences in perspective. An
interesting difference was discussed by Weyl in his Rouse Ball lecture in
1930,. He contrasted the new type of unification strongly to the earlier
geometrically unified field theories (including his own). He was quite explicit
that he now considered his earlier ideas on geometrization of ``all of
physics'' as premature and declared that the new, more empirically based
approach would have to go a long way before it could be considered as a true
""geometrization"" of matter structures.

mirror quantum mechanically, we find that it always oscillates, has no
stationary steady-state, and exhibits uncertainties in position and momentum
which are typically larger than the mean values. This means that previous
linearised fluctuation analyses which have been used to predict these highly
quantum states are of limited use. We find that the achievable accuracy in
