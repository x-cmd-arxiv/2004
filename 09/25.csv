of Cosmic Microwave Background, supernova and X-ray galaxy cluster data. Our
analysis employs a minimum of priors and exploits the complementary nature of
these data sets. We examine a series of dark energy models with up to three
free parameters: the current dark energy equation of state w_0, the early time
equation of state w_et and the scale factor at transition, a_t. From a combined
analysis of all three data sets, assuming a constant equation of state and that
the Universe is flat, we measure w_0=-1.05+0.10-0.12. Including w_et as a free
parameter and allowing a_t to vary over the range 0.5<a_t<0.95 where the data
sets have discriminating power, we measure w_0=-1.27+0.33-0.39 and
w_et=-0.66+0.44-0.62. We find no significant evidence for evolution in the dark
energy equation of state parameter with redshift. Marginal hints of evolution
in the supernovae data become less significant when the cluster constraints are
also included in the analysis. The complementary nature of the data sets leads
to a tight constraint on the mean matter density, Omega_m and alleviates a
number of other parameter degeneracies, including that between the scalar
spectral index n_s, the physical baryon density Omega_bh^2 and the optical
depth tau. This complementary nature also allows us to examine models in which
we drop the prior on the curvature. For non-flat models with a constant
equation of state, we measure w_0=-1.09+0.12-0.15 and Omega_de=0.70+-0.03. Our
analysis includes spatial perturbations in the dark energy fluid, assuming a
sound speed c_s^2 =1. For our most general dark energy model, not including
such perturbations would lead to spurious constraints on w_et which would be
tighter by approximately a factor two with the current data. (abridged)

  Number of E-foldings of Inflation","5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  In numerical calculations of the primordial power spectrum of perturbations
produced during inflation, for very little wavenumber $k$s, to implement the
initial conditions required of the perturbation mode functions consistently, we
must let the universe experience more e-foldings of inflation than that
required of it to solve the horizon, flatness and other pre-inflation problems.
However, if the number of e-foldings of inflation has an upper bound, then for
perturbations at scales greater than some critical value, the initial
conditions required of the mode functions cannot be implemented physically.
Because at the inflation beginning point, these perturbation modes lie outside
the horizon. We propose that such perturbations do not contribute to the
Cosmological Microwave Background Anisotropy (CMBA). Under this proposition,
the exceptional lowness of the observed little $l$ muli-poles of CMBA is
reproduced numerically. In Linde's $\phi^2$ model, the upper bound on the
number of e-foldings of inflation is determined to be 65 approximately.

remnant (SNR) G349.7+0.2 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The overall SNR
spectrum can be described by two spectral components. The soft component is in
ionization equilibrium and has a temperature of ~0.8 keV; the hard spectral
component has a temperature of ~1.4 keV, an ionization timescale of ~5x10^{11}
cm{-3}s and enhanced abundances of Si. The spatially resolved spectral modeling
shows that S may also be enhanced, at least in some regions. The enhanced
abundances clearly point to the presence of an ejecta component in this
remnant. The X-ray morphology of G349.7+0.2 is strikingly similar to that at
radio wavelengths - an irregular shell with a brighter eastern side - which is
consistent with expansion in a medium with a large scale density gradient. The
remnant is known to be interacting with a molecular cloud (from the presence of
OH(1720 MHz) masers), but this interaction is probably limited to the central
portion of the SNR, as seen in SNR IC 443. We found that HI clouds are present
in the SNR region, which supports the notion that G349.7+0.2 belongs to a class
of remnants evolving in the intercloud medium (such are IC 443 and W44,
Chevalier 1999), which is also responsible for the remnant's morphology.
G349.7+0.2 does not have the mixed-morphology found for other maser-emitting
SNRs studied to date in X-rays, but its morphology can be explained by a
projection model for mixed-morphology SNRs. We have identified a point source
close to the center of the SNR with a luminosity of Lx(0.5-10.0 keV) ~
(0.2-2.3)x10^{34} d_{22} erg/s, which is consistent with that of the compact

constant velocity are well reproduced by the models. Several wind models with
terminal velocities from a few tens of $\kms$ up to $10^3$ $\kms$ are

deflagration produces an inhomogeneous mixture of unburned carbon and oxygen

During the subsequent detonation stage, a supersonic detonation wave propagates
through the material unburned by the deflagration. The total energy released in

quantum dot elastically attached to electrodes are treated in the
Born-Oppenheimer approach. The relation between thermal and shot noise induced
by the source-drain voltage $V_{bias}$ is found when the SET operates in a
regime tending to thermodynamic equilibrium far from resonance. The
equilibration of electron-phonon subsystems produces broadening and doublet
splitting of transparency resonances helping to explain a negative differential
resistance (NDR)of current versus voltage (I-V) curves. Mismatch between the
electron and phonon temperatures brings out the bouncing-ball mode in the
crossover regime close to the internal vibrations mode. The shuttle mechanism
occurs at a threshold $V_{bias}$ of the order of the Coulomb energy $U_c$. An
accumulation of charge is followed by the Coulomb blockade and broken symmetry
of a single or double well potential. The Landau bifurcation cures the
shuttling instability and the resonance levels of the quantum dot become split
because of molecular tunneling. We calculate the tunnel gaps of conductivity
and propose a tunneling optical trap (TOT) for quantum dot isolation permitting
coherent molecular tunneling by virtue of Josephson oscillations in a charged
Bose gas. We discuss experimental conditions when the above theory can be

introduction of a ghost scalar field results in a number of interesting
cosmological and phenomenological implications. In this paper, we derive the
exact cosmological solutions for a number of scenarios where at late stages,
the ghost behaves like dark matter, or dark energy. The full solutions give
valuable information about the non-linear regime beyond the asymptotic first
order analysis presented in the literature. The generic feature is that these
ghost cosmologies give rise to smooth transitions between radiation dominated
phases (or more general power-law expansions) at early epochs and ghost dark
matter resp. ghost dark energy dominated late epochs. The current age of our
universe places us right at the non-linear transition phase. By studying the
evolution backwards in time, we find that the dominance of the ghost over
ordinary baryonic matter and radiative contributions persists back to the
earliest times such that the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry is dictated to
a good approximation by the ghost alone. We also find that the Jeans

Even for non-supersymmetric theories, appropriate perturbative calculations
(e.g. using the background field method) give non-perturbative information
about the vacuum structure. However, in supersymmetric theories, these results
are often exact.
  The gauge theory effective superpotential is encoded by a hyperelliptic
curve, which emerges from the geometry of the string theory background, and may
be rederived using other techniques based on zero-dimensional matrix integrals,
the dynamics of integrable systems and the factorization of Seiberg-Witten
curves. We describe in detail how each technique highlights complementary
aspects of the gauge theory.
  The spectral curve requires the introduction of additional fundamental matter
fields, which act as UV regulators by embedding the gauge theory in a UV-finite
theory. We focus in detail on maximally-confining vacua of N=1 gauge theories
with fundamental matter, and of theories with SO and Sp gauge groups. Both
cases require refinements to the basic techniques used for SU gauge theory
without fundamental matter.

theories with fundamental matter and arbitrary tree-level superpotential, which
reproduce known results in special cases. The problem of factorizing the
Seiberg-Witten curve for N=2 gauge theories with fundamental matter is also

proved among other things that the LIL holds for {S(n,t) : n =1,2, ...}
simultaneously for all t. In other words, the LIL is dynamically stable.
Subsequently, we showed that in the case that the X(i,0)'s are standard normal,
the classical integral test is not dynamically stable. Presently, we study the

positive (d/2)-dimensional capacity. This generalizes greatly the earlier works
of J. Hawkes (1977), J.-P. Kahane (1985a; 1985b), and one of the present

  (2) If the Hausdorff dimension of F is strictly greater than (d/2), then with
probability one, we can find a finite number of points \zeta_1,...,\zeta_m such
that for any rotation matrix \theta that leaves F in B(\theta F), one of the
\zeta_i's is interior to B(\theta F). In particular, B(F) has interior-points

family of bridged sheets. Item (2) is proved by developing a notion of

obtained from the classical Carleson Corona Theorem by linear algebra. Our
proof provides a streamlined way of obtaining this result and allows one to get
a better estimate on the norm of the solution. In particular, we were able to
improve the estimate found in the recent work of T. Trent. Note that, the
solution of the $H^{\infty}$ matrix corona problem in the disk can be easily
obtained from the $H^{2}$ corona problem either by factorization, or by the
Commutant Lifting Theorem. The $H^{p}$ corona problem in the polydisk was
originally solved by K.C. Lin. The solution used Koszul complexes and was
rather complicated because one had to consider higher order
$\bar{\partial}$-equations. Our proof is more transparent and it improves upon
Lin's result in several ways. First, we were able to show that the norm of the
solution is independent of the number of generators. Additionally, we
illustrate that the norm of the solution grows at most proportionally to the
dimension of the polydisk. Our approach is based on one that was originated by
M. Andersson. In the disk it essentially depends on Green's Theorem and duality
to obtain the estimate. In the polydisk we use Riesz projections to reduce the
problem to the disk case.

Newtonian and the relativistic approach; and proposes a novel
alternative-explanation. The new alternative-explanation is based on
refraction-phenomenon of optics. It predicts that as the ray passes
through/near the stars atmospheric-medium, it bends due to
refraction-phenomenon towards star-core, like a ray bends while passing through
a prism or water-drop. A semi-empirical estimation of the atmospheric-height
and its refractive-index are made to find the refraction-results. The
refraction-based theory also suggests new explanation for gravitational
red/blue shift; it tells that frequency remains constant (as it is so in
refraction-phenomenon) and the red/blue shift is due to change in wavelength
due to change in velocity of light in the medium . Estimated results for
bending of light and the red/blue shift etc. with the new approach though agree
well with known values, but important thing is that the physics is quite
different. The proposed refraction-based theory proposes a new-look on
black-hole, suggesting that black-hole formation is critically due to
total-internal-reflection within atmosphere and subsequent absorption into the
star-core. Gravitational-lensing is explained as real refraction-lensing. The
