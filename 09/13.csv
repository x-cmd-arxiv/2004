contrasting its application to CMB, weak lensing and redshift surveys. We
illustrate the latter with a 10 parameter MCMC D-optimisation of a dark energy
redshift survey. When averaged over a standard dark energy model space the
resulting optimal survey typically has only one or two redshift bins, located
at z<2. By exploiting optimisation we show how the statistical power of such
surveys is significantly enhanced. Experiment design is aided by the richness
of the figure of merit landscape which means one can impose secondary
optimisation criteria at little cost. For example, one may choose either to
maximally test a single model (such as \Lambda CDM) or to get the most general
model-independent constraints possible (e.g. on a whole space of dark energy
models). Such freedom points to a future where cosmological experiments become
increasingly specialised and optimisation increasingly important.

redistribution processes relative to the nebula gas. Meter-sized particles
drift rapidly inwards near the nebula midplane, and material evaporates when
the particles cross a condensation/evaporation boundary. The material cannot be
removed as fast in its vapor form as it is being supplied in solid form, so its
concentration increases locally by a large factor (more than an order of
magnitude under nominal conditions). As time goes on, the vapor phase
enhancement propagates for long distances inside the evaporation boundary
(potentially all the way in to the star). Meanwhile, material is enhanced in
its solid form over a characteristic lengthscale outside the evaporation
boundary. This effect is applicable to any condensible (water, silicates, {\it
etc.}). Three distinct radial enhancement/depletion regimes can be discerned by
use of a simple model. Meteoritics applications include oxygen fugacity and
isotopic variations, as well as isotopic homogenization in silicates. Planetary
system applications include more robust enhancement of solids in Jupiter's core
formation region than previously suggested. Astrophysical applications include
differential, time-dependent enhancement of vapor phase CO and H$_2$O in the

field-of-view that these surveys can cover a hemisphere in a timescale ~1 yr.
Adopting this assumption, we focus on two key experiments which will yield
fundamental new measurements in cosmology, characterizing the properties of the
mysterious dark energy which dominates the dynamics of today's Universe.
Experiment I will map out ~10^9 HI galaxies to redshift z~1.5, providing the
premier measurement of the clustering power spectrum of galaxies: accurately
delineating the acoustic oscillations and the `turnover'. Experiment II will
quantify the cosmic shear distortion of ~10^10 radio continuum sources,
determining a precise power spectrum of the dark matter, and its growth as a
function of cosmic epoch. We contrast the performance of the SKA in precision
cosmology with that of other facilities which will, probably or possibly, be
available on a similar timescale. We conclude that data from the SKA will yield
transformational science as the direct result of four key features: (i) the
immense cosmic volumes probed, exceeding future optical redshift surveys by
more than an order of magnitude; (ii) well-controlled systematic effects such
as the narrow `k-space window function' for Experiment I and the
accurately-known `point-spread function' for Experiment II; (iii) the ability
to measure with high precision large-scale modes in the clustering power
spectra, for which nuisance effects such as non-linear structure growth,
peculiar velocities and `galaxy bias' are minimised; and (iv) different
degeneracies between key parameters to those which are inherent in the CMB.

parameters. We express, in a non-perturbed setting, the coordinates (Cartesian,

adjustable constants called elements (orbital elements or rotational elements).
If, under disturbance, we use this expression as ansatz and endow the
""constants"" with time dependence, then the perturbed velocity (Cartesian or
angular) will consist of a partial derivative with respect to time and a
so-called convective term, one that includes the time derivatives of the
variable ""constants."" Out of sheer convenience, the so-called Lagrange
constraint is often imposed. It nullifies the convective term and, thereby,
guarantees that the functional dependence of the velocity upon the time and
""constants"" stays, under perturbation, the same as it used to be in the
undisturbed setting.
  When the dynamical equations, written in terms of the ""constants,"" are
demanded to be symplectic (and the ""constants"" make conjugated pairs $ Q, P$),
these ""constants"" are called Delaunay elements, in the orbital case, or Andoyer
elements, in the rotational case. The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements
share a feature not visible with a naked eye: in certain cases, the standard
equations render these elements non-osculating.
  Hence, even though the Andoyer variables in the Kinoshita-Souchay theory are
introduced in a precessing frame of the Earth orbit, they nevertheless return
the angular velocity relative to an inertial frame.

parameters that affect the light curves are examined: the ejected mass, the
progenitor radius, the explosion energy, the $^{56}$Ni mass, and the extent of
$^{56}$Ni mixing. The following affects have been found: 1) the larger the
progenitor radius the brighter the early--time light curve, with little affect
on the late--time light curve, 2) the larger the envelope mass the fainter the
early light curve and the flatter the slope of the late light curve, 3) the
larger the explosion energy the brighter the early light curve and the steeper
the slope of the late light curve, 4) the larger the $^{56}$Ni mass the
brighter the overall light curve after 20 to 50 days, with no affect on the
early light curve, 5) the more extensive the $^{56}$Ni mixing the brighter the
early light curve and the steeper the late light curve. The primary parameters
affecting the light curve shape are the progenitor radius and the ejected mass.
The secondary parameters are the explosion energy, $^{56}$Ni mass and $^{56}$Ni
mixing. I find that while in principle the general shape and absolute magnitude
of a light curve indicate a unique set of parameters, in practice it is
difficult to avoid some ambiguity in the parameters. I find that the
nickel--powered diffusion wave and the recombination of helium produce a
prominent secondary peak in all our calculations. The feature is less prominent
when compositional mixing, both $^{56}$Ni mixing and mixing between the
hydrogen and helium layers, occurs. The model photospheric temperatures and
velocities are presented, for comparison to observation.

surface brightness to stellar flux (S/F_*) of approximately two orders of
magnitude towards the blue end of the far-UV bandpass. Scattering models using
simple dust geometries fail to reproduce the observed S/F_* for realistic grain
properties. The high spectral resolution of the FUSE data reveals a rich
fluorescent molecular hydrogen spectrum ~1000"" north of the star that is
clearly distinguished from the steady blue continuum. The S/F_* remains roughly
constant at all nebular pointings, showing that fluorescent molecular hydrogen
is not the dominant cause for the blue rise. We discuss three possible
mechanisms for the ``Blue Dust'': differential extinction of the dominant star
(HD 34078), unusual dust grain properties, and emission from nebular dust. We
conclude that uncertainties in the nebular geometry and the degree of dust
clumping are most likely responsible for the blue rise. As an interesting
consequence of this result, we consider how IC 405 would appear in a spatially

order of magnitude increase in the number of faint linear filaments with
typical lengths of few arcminutes. Many of the filaments show morphological
characteristics similar to the Galactic center nonthermal radio filaments
(NRFs). The linear filaments are not isolated but are generally clustered in
star forming regions where prominent NRFs had been detected previously. The
extensions of many of these linear filaments appear to terminate at either a
compact source or a resolved shell-like thermal source. A relationship between
the filaments, the compact and extended thermal sources as well as a lack of
preferred orientation for many RFs should constrain models that are proposed to
explain the origin of nonthermal radio filaments in the Galactic center.

(RIS) can play an important role in dc spin current generation. The RIS makes
it possible to generate dc spin current via a simple gate configuration: a
single finger-gate that locates atop and orients transversely to a quantum
channel in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. The ac biased
finger-gate gives rise to a time-variation in the Rashba coupling parameter,
which causes spin-resolved RIS, and subsequently contributes to the dc spin
current. The spin current depends on both the static and the dynamic parts in
the Rashba coupling parameter, $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$, respectively, and is
proportional to $\alpha_0 \alpha_1^2$. The proposed gate configuration has the
added advantage that no dc charge current is generated. Our study also shows
that the spin current generation can be enhanced significantly in a double
finger-gate configuration.

enhancement of the rectification efficiency. This regime is marked by
persistent, uni-directional motion of the Brownian motor with few back-turns,
only. The corresponding asymmetric velocity distribution is then rather narrow,
with a support that predominantly favors only one sign for the velocity.

finite temperature, and finite length lead to characteristic non-monotonic
parameter dependencies of the average current. We discuss oscillations of the

  We compute analytically the distribution of trapping times for the global
system, which can take power-law, stretched-exponential or exponential forms
according to the values of $N$ and the regime of times considered. An effective
number of subsystems at age $t_w$, $N_{eff}(t_w)$, can be defined, which
decreases as $t_w$ increases, as well as an effective coherence length,
$\xi(t_w) \sim t_w^{(1-\mu)/d}$, where $\mu <1$ characterizes the trapping
times distribution of a single subsystem. We also compute the probability
distribution functions of the time intervals between large decorrelations,
which exhibit different power-law behaviours as $t_w$ increases (or $N$
decreases), and which should be accessible experimentally.
  Finally, we calculate the probability distribution function of the two-time
correlator.
  We show that in a phenomenological approach, where $N$ is replaced by the
effective number of subsystems $N_{eff}(t_w)$, the same qualitative behaviour
as in experiments and simulations of several glassy systems can be obtained.

one-dimensional vicinal surface. The formation of bunches is controlled by the
preferential attachment of atoms to descending steps (inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel
effect) and the ratio $d$ of the attachment rate to the terrace diffusion
coefficient. For generic parameters ($d > 0$) the model exhibits a very slow
crossover to a nontrivial asymptotic coarsening exponent $\beta \simeq 0.38$.
In the limit of infinitely fast terrace diffusion ($d=0$) linear coarsening
($\beta$ = 1) is observed instead. The different coarsening behaviors are
related to the fact that bunches attain a finite speed in the limit of large
size when $d=0$, whereas the speed vanishes with increasing size when $d > 0$.
For $d=0$ an analytic description of the speed and profile of stationary
bunches is developed.

constructions of capacity-achieving sequences of ensembles whose complexity
grows at least like the log of the inverse of the gap (in rate) to capacity.
The new bounded complexity result is achieved by puncturing bits, and allowing
in this way a sufficient number of state nodes in the Tanner graph representing
the codes. We also derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the decoding
complexity of randomly punctured codes on graphs. The bound holds for every
memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channel and is refined for the BEC.

proposed going beyond the bounds of traditional optics to increase the

``mesa'' beams.
  In this paper, we outline a general procedure for analyzing light propagating

presence of arbitrary optics. We apply these procedures to study the
Mexican-hat proposal. Results obtained by the techniques of this paper were
presented elsewhere, to demonstrate that the Mexican-hat proposal for

physics based on the use, at different detector mass scales (100 ton and 100
kton), of the liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) technique. The LAr
TPC technology has great potentials for both cases with large degree of
interplay between the two applications and a strong synergy. The ICARUS R&D
programme has demonstrated that the technology is mature and that one can built
a large ($\sim$ 1 kton) LAr TPC. We believe that one can conceive and design a
very large mass LAr TPC with a mass of 100 kton by employing a monolithic
technology based on the use of industrial, large volume cryogenic tankers
developed by the petro-chemical industry. We show a potential implementation of
a large LAr TPC detector. Such a detector would be an ideal match for a
Superbeam, Betabeam or Neutrino Factory, covering a broad physics program that
could include the detection of atmospheric, solar and supernova neutrinos, and
search for proton decays, in addition to the rich accelerator neutrino physics
program. In parallel, physics is calling for another application of the LAr TPC
technique at the level of 100 ton mass, for low energy neutrino physics and for
use as a near station setup in future long baseline neutrino facilities. We
present here the main physics objectives and outline the conceptual design of
such a detector.

theory is still a worthwhile subject. First, because there are very elegant and

particular, Descartes spent time looking for (and finding) a pair of amicable
numbers that previously in Europe had been unknown. Euler also mentions the

rediscovered by geometers and analysts since 1917 up to the present day: Radon
curves and antinorms.
  A Radon curve is a special kind of centrally symmetric closed convex curve in
the plane. A Radon plane is a normed plane obtained by using a Radon curve as
(the boundary of) the unit ball. Many known results in Euclidean geometry also
hold for Radon planes, for example the triangle and parallelogram area
formulas, certain theorems on angular bisectors, the area formula of a polygon
circumscribed about a circle, certain isoperimetric inequalities, and the
non-expansive property of certain non-linear projections.
  These results may be further generalized to arbitrary normed planes if we
formally change the statement of the result by referring in some places to the
antinorm instead of the norm. The antinorm is a norm dual to the norm of an
arbitrarily given normed plane, although it lives in the same plane as the
original norm.
  It is the purpose of this mainly expository paper to give a list of results
on antinorms that generalize results true for Radon norms, and in many cases
characterize Radon norms among all norms in the plane. Many of the results are
old, well-known, and have often been rediscovered. However, for most of the
results we give streamlined proofs. Also, some of the characterizations of
Radon curves given here seem not to have appeared previously in print.

is given by the sum of a normal component away from the boundary and a
contribution introduced by the boundary effects, which can be characterized by
a fixed point equation, and is reminiscent of limits arising in the
probabilistic analysis of certain algorithms. As the exponent of the power
weighting increases, the distribution undergoes a phase transition from the
normal contribution being dominant to the boundary effects dominating. In the
critical case where the weight is simple Euclidean length, both effects
contribute significantly to the limit law. We also give a law of large numbers

freedom. Inspired by the studies of this seminal model, solitary-wave dynamics
in lattice dynamical systems have proven vitally important in a diverse range
of physical problems--including energy relaxation in solids, denaturation of
the DNA double strand, self-trapping of light in arrays of optical waveguides,
and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in optical lattices. BECS, in particular,
due to their widely ranging and easily manipulated dynamical apparatuses--with
one to three spatial dimensions, positive-to-negative tuning of the
nonlinearity, one to multiple components, and numerous experimentally
accessible external trapping potentials--provide one of the most fertile
grounds for the analysis of solitary waves and their interactions. In this
paper, we review recent research on BECs in the presence of deep periodic
potentials, which can be reduced to nonlinear chains in appropriate
circumstances. These reductions, in turn, exhibit many of the remarkable
nonlinear structures (including solitons, intrinsic localized modes, and
vortices) that lie at the heart of the nonlinear science research seeded by the
FPU paradigm.

distance less than a typical radius, $R$. Numerical analysis reveals the
existence of a transition to clustering depending on the parameters of the
external flow and on $R$. A continuum description in terms of the number
density of particles is derived, and a linear stability analysis of the density
equation is performed in order to characterize the transitions observed in the

shown that the UV divergences in the nonperturbative solutions of the

turn leads to a nontrivial prescription dependence. Moreover, employing the
effective range expansion, the important procedure for imposing physical
boundary conditions to remove the nontrivial prescription dependence is
discussed and highlighted, especially before making physical claims. As
byproducts, some relations between the effective range expansion parameters are
