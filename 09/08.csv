Friedmann equations as a fluid parameterized by the density of dark matter and
undergoing an adiabatic expansion. This formulation is applied to the
Cardassian model. Choosing then parameters consistent with the supernova
observations, it gives a background expansion in which the cosmic temperature
fluctuations are calculated. The resulting spectrum is quite similar to what is
obtained in the standard concordance model. If the Cardassian fluid is
interpreted as a new kind of interacting dark matter, its overdensities are
driven into oscillations when the interaction energy is rising in importance.
This does not occur in a description of the Cardassian fluctuations motivated
by theories of modified gravity. There the energy of the underlying matter is
also conserved, which requires appearance of effective shear stress in the late
Universe. In both approaches that allow fluctuations the thermal power spectrum
at large scales is much too strongly enhanced by the late integrated

that the Cardassian model is ruled out by observations, expect in a small

A surprising result is that all of the NGC 2099 WDs have hydrogen-rich

spectral class. The number ratio in the field at the temperatures of the NGC

lack of DBs in these clusters and conclude that the most promising scenario for
the DA/DB number ratio discrepancy in young clusters is that hot, high-mass WDs
do not develop large enough helium convection zones to allow helium to be
brought to the surface and turn a hydrogen-rich WD into a helium-rich one.

built. They form when the gravitational instability of primordial density
fluctuations causes regions which are denser than average to slow their cosmic
expansion, recollapse, and virialize. Understanding the equilibrium structure
of these halos is thus a prerequisite for understanding galaxy and cluster
formation. Numerical N-body simulations of structure formation from
Gaussian-random-noise initial conditions in the CDM universe find a universal
internal structure for halos. Objects as different in size and mass as dwarf
spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters are predicted to have halos with the
same basic structure when properly rescaled, independent of halo mass, of the
shape of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, and of the
cosmological background parameters. This remarkable universality is a
fundamental prediction of the CDM model, but our knowledge is limited to the
``empirical'' N-body simulation results, with little analytical understanding.
We summarize here our attempts to fill this gap, in an effort to derive and
give physical insight to the numerical results and extend them beyond the range
of numerical simulation: (1) Simulated halos which form from highly simplified
initial conditions involving gravitational instability in a cosmological
pancake show that many of the universal properties of CDM halos are generic to
cosmological gravitational collapse and do not require Gaussian-random-noise
density fluctuations or hierarchical clustering. (2) A fluid approximation
derived from the Boltzmann equation yields an analytical theory of halo
dynamics which can explain many of the N-body results ... (abridged)

derive a set of equations that describes the evolution of the orbital angular
momentum and both spin vectors during inspiral. We find regions of phase space
that exhibit resonance behavior, characterized by small librations of the spin
vectors around a fixed orientation. Due to the loss of energy and orbital
angular momentum through radiation reaction, systems can eventually be captured
into these resonance orientations. By investigating the long-term evolution of
compact binaries with a variety of initial conditions, we find that the
distribution in parameter space can be strongly affected by resonance captures.
This has the effect of significantly reducing the size of search space for
gravitational wave sources, in turn improving the chances of detecting such
sources through methods of template matching. Furthermore, by calculating the
expected spin distribution at the end of the inspiral phase, we can predict
what are the most likely initial conditions for the plunge phase, a result of
great interest for numerical relativity calculations.

radio luminosity function ensures that sources are detected over a wide range

observations are an efficient and unbiased probe of both nuclear (AGN) and
star-forming activity over all cosmic epochs.
  The SKA's ``ultra-deep radio continuum surveys'' will provide the answers to
at least three key astrophysical questions: (i) the star-formation history of
the Universe, (ii) the evolution of the low-power end of the radio galaxy
luminosity function and (iii) the relationship between the radio-loud AGN,
star-formation and radio-quiet AGN phenomena.
  In this paper we discuss the AGN science that will be enabled by the deep
radio continuum studies using the SKA. It is important to recognise that the
sub-microJy SKA sky will be dominated by populations other than `radio-loud'
AGN. In this way the SKA will not only provide an unbiased tracer of the
star-formation history of the Universe but also be able to study the
populations of sources we currently describe as `radio-quiet'. To illustrate
this point we present simulations of the extragalactic radio sky based from
models of the evolution of the radio luminosity function. From these
simulations we predict typical source distributions and estimate the natural
confusion limit to ultra-faint flux density limits relevant to the science and
design goals of the SKA.

such emission give support to the idea that diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)
can amplify magnetic fields by large factors. Furthermore, the uncertain
character of the amplification process leaves open the possibility that ejecta
fields, while large enough to support radio emission and DSA, may be much lower
than typical interstellar medium values. We show that DSA in such low reverse
shock fields is extremely nonlinear and efficient in the production of
cosmic-ray (CR) ions, although CRs greatly in excess of mc^2 are not produced.
These nonlinear effects, which occur at the forward shock as well, are
manifested most importantly in shock compression ratios much greater than four

become narrower, denser, and cooler than would be the case if efficient
cosmic-ray production did not occur. The changes in the SNR structure and

that the contribution of the scattered radiation to the total monochromatic

ratio of the stellar mass in spheroids to the black hole mass density evolves
as (1+z)^{-\alpha}, while the ratio of the stellar mass in disks+irregulars to
that in spheroids evolves as (1+z)^{-\beta}, and we derive constraints on

suggesting that the fraction of stellar mass in spheroids decreases with
increasing redshift. This is consistent with recent determinations that show
that the mass density at high redshift is dominated by galaxies with irregular

density distributions allow the human eye to detect and track defects in liquid

study defects in gyroid mesophases of amphiphilic ternary fluids. While the

the most general quadratic global and local (single-ion) anisotropic spin
interactions, and with the magnetic induction ${\bf B}$. For antiferromagnetic
couplings and $s_1>1/2$, the low temperature $T$ magnetization ${\bm M}({\bm

step of which occurs at the non-universal level-crossing magnetic induction
$B_{s,s_1}^{\rm lc}(\theta,\phi)$, where $\theta,\phi$ define the direction of
${\bm B}$. The specific heat $C_V$ exhibits zeroes as $T\to0$ at these
$B_{s,s_1}^{\rm lc}(\theta,\phi)$ values, which are equally surrounded by
universal peak pairs as $T\to0$. The non-universal $B_{s,s_1}^{\rm

behavior, the structure and anisotropy of which depend upon the various global
and local anisotropic spin interaction energies. We solve the model exactly for
$s_1=1/2$, 1, and 5/2, and present ${\bm M}({\bm B})$ and $C_V({\bm B})$ curves
at low $T$ for these cases. For weakly anisotropic dimers, rather simple
analytic formulas for ${\bm M}({\bm B})$ and $C_V({\bm B})$ at arbitrary $s_1$
accurately fit the exact solutions at sufficiently low $T$ or large $B$. An
expression for $B_{s,s_1}^{\rm lc}(\theta,\phi)$ accurate to second order in
the four independent anisotropy energies is derived. Our results are discussed

media is proposed. We deal with four kinds of waves, they are the acoustic wave
in fluid, the elastic shear wave in two diemnsional solid, and the E- and
H-polarized electromagnetic waves in two diemnsional lossless medium. We first
show that a universal wave equation governing the wave motion of all these four
kinds of waves can be derived. We then introduce an auxiliary field, and give
the universal expressions for the energy densities and energy flows of these
waves. This unified treatment provides intuitive insights, which may be helpful
in understanding the essential physics of various wave phenomena, or useful for
designing new photonic and sonic devices.

studied. The constraint of a constant area is found to couple the dynamics of
the two Cartesian components of the position vector of the polymer ring through
the Lagrange multiplier function which is time dependent. The time dependence
of the Lagrange multiplier is evaluated in a closed form both at short and long
times. At long times, the time dependence is weak, and is mainly governed by
the inverse of the first mode of the area. The presence of the constraint
changes the nature of the relaxation of the internal modes. The time
correlation of the position vectors of the ring is found to be dominated by the
first Rouse mode which does not relax even at very long times. The mean square
displacement of the radius vector is found to be diffusive, which is associated
with the rotational diffusion of the ring.

is an iterative algorithm recently introduced by the statistical physics
community that is very effective in solving random k-SAT problems even with
densities close to the satisfiability threshold. We first describe how any SAT
formula can be associated with a novel family of Markov random fields (MRFs),
parameterized by a real number \rho \in [0,1]. We then show that applying
belief propagation--a well-known ``message-passing'' technique for estimating
marginal probabilities--to this family of MRFs recovers a known family of
algorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (\rho = 1) to
standard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over SAT assignments at
the other extreme (\rho = 0). Configurations in these MRFs have a natural
interpretation as partial satisfiability assignments, on which a partial order
can be defined. We isolate cores as minimal elements in this partial ordering,
which are also fixed points of survey propagation and the only assignments with
positive probability in the MRF for \rho=1. Our experimental results for k=3
suggest that solutions of random formulas typically do not possess non-trivial
cores. This makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial
assignments for \rho<1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very
close to being cores. To that end, we investigate the associated lattice
structure, and prove a weight-preserving identity that shows how any MRF with
\rho>0 can be viewed as a ``smoothed'' version of the uniform distribution over
satisfying assignments (\rho=0). Finally, we isolate properties of Gibbs
sampling and message-passing algorithms that are typical for an ensemble of
k-SAT problems.

Added content","LivingRev.Rel.8:4,2005","10.12942/lrr-2005-4",,"gr-qc",,"  Equal-arm interferometric detectors of gravitational radiation allow phase
measurements many orders of magnitude below the intrinsic phase stability of
the laser injecting light into their arms. This is because the noise in the
laser light is common to both arms, experiencing exactly the same delay, and
thus cancels when it is differenced at the photo detector. In this situation,
much lower level secondary noises then set overall performance. If, however,
the two arms have different lengths (as will necessarily be the case with
space-borne interferometers), the laser noise experiences different delays in
the two arms and will hence not directly cancel at the detector. In order to
solve this problem, a technique involving heterodyne interferometry with
unequal arm lengths and independent phase-difference readouts has been
proposed. It relies on properly time-shifting and linearly combining
independent Doppler measurements, and for this reason it has been called
Time-Delay Interferometry (or TDI). This article provides an overview of the
theory and mathematical foundations of TDI as it will be implemented by the
forthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) mission. We have purposely left out from this first version of

important early observation was the apparent absence of exotics, baryons

Years later, QCD is well established, hadron spectroscopy has been relatively
inactive, but the absence of exotics remains poorly understood. The recent
observation of narrow, prominent exotic baryons has stirred up new interest in
hadron spectroscopy. At present the experimental situation is confused; so is
theory. The recent discoveries are striking. So too is the complete absence of
exotic mesons, and, except for the recent discoveries, of exotic baryons as
well. Whether or not the new states are confirmed, the way we look at
complicated states of confined quarks and gluons has changed. Perhaps the most
lasting result, and the one emphasized in these notes, is a new appreciation
for the role of diquark correlations in QCD.

to misinterpret as a manifestation of the pion pole dominance. An axial
current, however, cannot fluctuate into a pion, but only to heavy axial-vector
states, since the lepton current is transverse. This is the miracle of the PCAC
hypothesis which dictates a specific conspiracy between the heavy fluctuations,
so that all together they mock the pion pole. Indeed, the observed Q^2
dependence of the axial form factor is controlled by the effective mass m_A
\sim 1 GeV, rather than the pion mass. On the contrary, the onset of nuclear
shadowing is governed by the small pion mass, rather than by the large axial
mass scale. This is in variance with the conventional wisdom which equates the
fluctuation lifetime and the coherence time. For the case of axial current they
are different by almost two orders of magnitude. As a result, neutrino
interactions are shadowed at very low energies of few hundred MeV, while energy
of about 10 GeV is needed to access nuclear shadowing for the vector current.
On the contrary to naive expectations, nuclear absorption enhances, rather than
suppresses the cross section of coherent neutrino-production of pions which is
the strongest channel (half of the total cross section) in the black disc
limit.

observe the a priori most probable set of predicted properties (the

observations (the ``top-down'' approach), or the most probable set consistent
with the existence of observers (the ``anthropic'' approach). These inhabit a
spectrum of levels of conditionalization and can lead to qualitatively
different predictions. For example, in a context in which the densities of
various species of dark matter vary among members of an ensemble of otherwise
similar regions, from the top-down or anthropic viewpoints -- but not the
bottom-up -- it would be natural for us to observe multiple types of dark
matter with similar contributions to the observed dark matter density. In the
anthropic approach it is also possible in principle to strengthen this argument
and the limit the number of likely dark matter sub-components. In both cases
the argument may be extendible to dark energy or primordial density
perturbations. This implies that the anthropic approach to cosmology,
introduced in part to explain ""coincidences"" between unrelated constituents of

power spectrum from inflation for universes with $\Omega_0 < 1$. However, the
so-called ``Open Inflation'' models, which are attracting renewed interest in
the context of the ``string theory landscape'' give a different result, and
offer a more fully developed picture of the cosmology and fundamental physics
basis for inflation with $\Omega_0 < 1$. The Open Inflation power spectrum
depends not only on $\Omega_0$, but on the parameters of the effective fields
that drive the universe {\em before} the Big Bang (in ``another part of the
landscape''). This paper considers the search for features in CMB temperature
anisotropy data that might reflect a primordial spectrum of the Open Inflation
form. We ask whether this search could teach us about high energy physics that
described the universe before the onset of the Big Bang, and perhaps even
account for the low CMB quadrupole. Unfortunately our conclusion is that the
specific features we consider are unobservable even with future experiments
although we note a possible loophole connected with our use of the thin wall
approximation.

particles in a non-commutative two-sheeted spacetime was proposed. This model
considers a universe made with two spacetime sheets embedded in a 5D bulk where
the fifth dimension is restricted to only two points. It was shown that this
construction has several important consequences for the quantum dynamics of
massive particles. Most notably, it was demonstrated that a coupling arises
between the two sheets allowing matter exchange in presence of intense magnetic
vector potentials. In this paper, we show that non-commutative geometry is not
absolutely necessary to obtain such a result since a more traditional approach
allows one to reach a similar conclusion. The fact that two different
approaches provide similar results suggests that standard matter exchange
between branes might finally occur contrary to conventional belief.

reduction of optimal control systems. Exploring the corresponding Hamiltonian

systems, observability and invariant differential forms. The approach is
applicable to non-degenerate optimal control systems with smooth integral cost
function. The cost function is defined on the trajectories of a smooth
dynamical control system with unconstrained controls and fixed boundary
conditions. Such systems form a category of Lagrangian systems with morphisms

regularity of a Cohen-Macaulay algebra, and we improve a well-known bound. The
main goal of the paper, though, is to improve on results of Bigatti, Geramita
and Migliore concerning geometric consequences of maximal growth of the Hilbert
function of the Artinian reduction of a set of points. When the points have the
Uniform Position Property, the consequences they gave are even more striking.
Here we weaken the growth condition, assuming only that the values of the
Hilbert function of the Artinian reduction are equal in two consecutive
degrees, and that the first of these degrees is greater than the second
reduction number of the points. We continue to get nice geometric consequences
even from this weaker assumption. However, we have surprising examples to show
that imposing the Uniform Position Property on the points does not give the
striking consequences that one might expect. This leads to a better
understanding of the Hilbert function, and the ideal itself, of a set of points
with the Uniform Position Property, which is an important open question. In the
last section we describe the role played by the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP)
in this theory, and we show that the general hyperplane section of a smooth

was measured for missing momenta up to 1000 MeV/c, while the A_TL asymmetry was
extracted for missing momenta up to 660 MeV/c. For missing momenta up to 150
MeV/c, the measured cross section is described well by calculations that use a
variational ground-state wave function of the 3He nucleus derived from a
potential that includes three-body forces. For missing momenta from 150 to 750
MeV/c, strong final-state interaction effects are observed. Near 1000 MeV/c,
the experimental cross section is more than an order of magnitude larger than
predicted by available theories. The A_TL asymmetry displays characteristic
features of broken factorization, and is described reasonably well by available
models.

framework of the relativistic mean field ($RMF$) approach in a pure nucleon
plus lepton scheme. The $\delta$-field leads to a larger repulsion in dense
neutron-rich matter and to a definite splitting of proton and neutron effective
masses. Both features are influencing the stability conditions of the neutron
stars. Two parametrizations for the effective nonlinear Lagrangian density are
used to calculate the nuclear equation of state ($EOS$) and the neutron star
properties, and compared to correlated Dirac-Brueckner results. We conclude
that in order to reproduce reasonable nuclear structure and neutron star
properties within a $RMF$ approach a density dependence of the coupling
constants is required.

sender and receiver can prove the presence of entanglement in a quantum state

entanglement proof one can use the class of entanglement witness (EW) operators
that can be constructed from the available measurements results. This class of
EWs can be used to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of quantum correlations even when a quantum state cannot be
completely reconstructed. The set of optimal EWs for two well-known
entanglement based (EB) schemes, the 6-state and the 4-state EB protocols, has
been obtained recently [M. Curty et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 217903 (2004)].
Here we complete these results, now showing specifically the analysis for the
case of prepare&measure (P&M) schemes. For this, we investigate the signal
states and detection methods of the 4-state and the 2-state P&M schemes. For
each of these protocols we obtain a reduced set of EWs. More importantly, each
set of EWs can be used to derive a necessary and sufficient condition to prove
that quantum correlations are present in these protocols.
