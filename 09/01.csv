found to harbor a planet, joining the two--planet system around GJ 876. The low
mass of the planet raises questions about its constitution, with possible
compositions of primarily H and He gas, ice/rock, or rock--dominated. The
implied semi--major axis is $a$ = 0.028 AU = 14 stellar radii, raising issues
of planet formation, migration, and tidal coupling with the star. GJ 436 is
$>3$ Gyr old, based on both kinematic and chromospheric diagnostics. The star
exhibits no photometric variability on the 2.644-day Doppler period to a
limiting amplitude of 0.0004 mag, supporting the planetary interpretation of
the Doppler periodicity. Photometric transits of the planet across the star are
ruled out for gas giant compositions and are also unlikely for solid

We also consider nonzero inner torques on the disk, and explore different

radiation MHD simulations of magnetorotational turbulence. Bound-free metal
opacity generally produces significantly less spectral hardening than previous
models which only considered Compton scattering and free-free opacity. It also
tends to keep the effective photosphere near the surface, resulting in spectra
which are remarkably independent of the stress prescription and vertical

affect the parameters of other spectral components when this simpler disk model
is used to fit modern X-ray data. For a given source, our models predict that
the luminosity in the high/soft state should approximately scale with the
fourth power of the empirically inferred maximum temperature, but with a slight

idealized structural models, in which the strain is as small as is possible in
the absence of long-range order. For covalent amorphous semiconductors and

crystal-like local environment, with perfect coordination and chemical
ordering, yet longer-range order is nonexistent. Defects, such as missing or
added bonds, or chemical mismatches, however, are not accounted for. In this
paper we explore under which conditions the idealized CRN model without defects
captures the properties of the material, and under which conditions defects are
an inherent part of the idealized model. We find that the density of defects in
tetrahedral networks does not vary smoothly with variations in the interaction
strengths, but jumps from close-to-zero to a finite density. Consequently, in
certain materials, defects do not play a role except for being thermodynamical
excitations, whereas in others they are a fundamental ingredient of the ideal

as conventional semiconductor substrates has created significant interests in
theoretical predictions of possible metastable ``half-metallic'' zincblende
ferromagnets, which are normally more stable in other structure-types, e.g.,
NiAs. Such predictions were based in the past on differences $\Delta_{\rm
bulk}$ in the total-energies of the respective {\em bulk} crystal forms
(zincblende and NiAs). We show here that the appropriate criterion is comparing
difference $\Delta_{\rm epi}(a_s)$ in {\em epitaxial} total-energies. This
reveals that even if $\Delta_{\rm bulk}$ is small, still for MnAs, CrSb, CrAs,
CrTe, $\Delta_{\rm epi}(a_s) > 0$ for all substrate lattice constant $a_s$, so
the zincblende phase is not stabilized. For CrS we find $\Delta_{\rm epi}(a_s)
<0$, but the system is antiferromagnetic, thus not half-metallic. Finally,
zincblende CrSe is predicted to be epitaxially stable for $a_s > 6.2$ \AA\ and

have offered evidence that the linear-elastic bending theory fails to describe
the high-curvature mechanics of DNA. Motivated by this recent experimental
work, we develop a simple and exact theory of the statistical mechanics of
linear-elastic polymer chains that can undergo a kinking transition. We
characterize the kinking behavior with a single parameter and show that the

on step bunching during sublimation of crystals with a pronounced
Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier in the regime of weak desorption. A strong step
bunching instability takes place when the kinetic length is larger than the
average distance between the steps on the vicinal surface. In the opposite
limit the instability is weak and step bunching can occur only when the
magnitude of step-step repulsion is small. The central result are power law
relations of the between the width, the height, and the minimum interstep
distance of a bunch. These relations are obtained from a continuum evolution
equation for the surface profile, which is derived from the discrete step
dynamical equations for. The analysis of the continuum equation reveals the
existence of two types of stationary bunch profiles with different scaling
properties. Through a mathematical equivalence on the level of the discrete
step equations as well as on the continuum level, our results carry over to the
problems of step bunching induced by growth with a strong inverse ES effect,
and by electromigration in the attachment/detachment limited regime. Thus our
work provides support for the existence of universality classes of step
bunching instabilities [A. Pimpinelli et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 206103

the Lorentz invariance of the shower and improving the coverage of the phase

able to enforce desired results, such as isospin symmetry or meson-baryon
ratios, more intuitively. These new developments are compared against existing
LEP data. Effective is used to generate the mass spectrum of supersymmetric
models. This program is able to provide the 1-loop effective potential and
1-loop mass matrices for an arbitrary N=1 supersymmetric model. This software

system. We prove the universal correspondence between eigenvalues of Gaudin
Hamiltonians and the so-called G-opers without monodromy in general gl(n) case

equation.
  Firstly we explore the quantum analog of the characteristic polynomial which
is a differential operator in a variable $u$ with the coefficients in
U(gl(n))^{\otimes N}. We will call it ""universal G-oper"". It is constructed by
the formula ""Det""(L(u)-\partial_u) where L(u) is the quantum Lax operator for
the Gaudin model and ""Det"" is appropriate definition of the determinant. The
coefficients of this differential operator are quantum Gaudin Hamiltonians
obtained by one of the authors (D.T. hep-th/0404153). We establish the
correspondence between eigenvalues and $G$-opers as follows: taking
eigen-values of the Gaudin's hamiltonians on the joint eigen-vector in the
tensor product of finite-dimensional representation of gl(n) and substituting
them into the universal G-oper we obtain the scalar differential operator
(scalar G-oper) which conjecturally does not have monodromy. We strongly
believe that our quantization of the Gaudin model coincides with quantization
obtained from the center of universal enveloping algebra on the critical level
and that our scalar G-oper coincides with the G-oper obtained by the geometric
Langlands correspondence, hence it provides very simple and explicit map
(Langlands correspondence) from Hitchin D-modules to G-opers in the case of
rational base curves. It seems to be easy to generalize the constructions to
the case of other semisimple Lie algebras and models like XYZ.

supersymmetric partner potentials is derived and a class of reflectionless
potentials are explicitly constructed. We extend the operator method of solving
the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator problem to a class of potentials called
shape invariant potentials. Further, we show that given any potential with at
least one bound state, one can very easily construct one continuous parameter
family of potentials having same eigenvalues and s-matrix. The supersymmetry
inspired WKB approximation (SWKB) is also discussed and it is shown that unlike
the usual WKB, the lowest order SWKB approximation is exact for the shape
invariant potentials. Finally, we also construct new exactly solvable periodic
potentials by using the machinery of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

Maxwell's equations are satisfied immediately, while the Lorentz force equation
follows from the interactions of sources and sinks. The usual electromagnetic
quantities then admit new interpretations as functions of the local
4-velocities. Electromagnetic waves are found to be described by oscillations
of the underlying medium which can therefore be identified with the

of the pitch of complex sounds via ghost stochastic resonance. In this scheme,
two neurons are driven by noise and different periodic signal each (with
frequencies f1=kf0 and f2=(k+1)f0, where k>1), and their outputs (plus noise)
are applied synaptically to a third neuron. Our numerical results, using the
Morris-Lecar neuron model with chemical synapses explicity considered, show
that intermediate noise levels enhance the response of the third neuron at
frequencies close to f0, as in the cases previously described of ghost
resonance. For the case of inharmonic combinations of inputs (both frequencies
shifted by the same amount Df) noise is also seen to enhance the response of
the third neuron at a frequency fr with also shift linearly with Df. In
addition, we show that similar resonances can be observed as a function of the
synaptic time constant. The suggested ghost-resonance-based stochastic
mechanism can thus arise either at the peripheral level or at a higher level of
neural processing in the perception of the pitch

theoretical analysis of the time problem in quantum mechanics based on the
concept of weak measurements are presented. A question of the time interval the
system spends in the specified state, when the final state of the system is
given, is raised. Using the concept of weak measurements the expression for
such time is obtained. The results are applied to the tunneling problem. A
procedure for the calculation of the asymptotic tunneling and reflection times
is proposed. Examples for delta-form and rectangular barrier illustrate the
obtained results. Using the concept of weak measurements the arrival time
probability distribution is defined by analogy with the classical mechanics.
The proposed procedure is suitable to the free particles and to particles
subjected to an external potential, as well. It is shown that such an approach
imposes an inherent limitation to the accuracy of the arrival time definition.
