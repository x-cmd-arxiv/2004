motivated physically in view of the faint optical/IR fluxes, the X-ray pulse
shapes that weakly depend on energy in XTE J1810-197, and the inferred emitting
areas that are less than or equal to the surface area of a neutron star. The
fitted temperatures remained the same while the flux declined by 46%, which can
be interpreted as a decrease in area of the emitting regions. The pulsar

by secular instability on the accreting components for low--mass binaries and
applied the results on a short-orbital-period BS F190 in the old cluster M67.
The results indicate no distinction in surface composition between the models
with and without thermohaline mixing during Roche lobe overflow, but we still
see the divergences of evolutionary tracks on HRD and CMD. The change of
surface composition makes the gainer bluer and smaller than the ones with
original surface composition while thermohaline mixing lessens the effect
slightly. If thermohaline mixing were to act instantaneously, the effect would
be lessened more. Our calculation shows that case A and case B mass transfer
may produce BSs in short- or relatively short-orbital-period binaries
(including Algol systems), and that CNO abundance abnormalities could be
observed in these products. Our simulation of F190 shows that the primary's
mass $M_{\rm 1i}$ of the appropriate models is located in the range of 1.40 to
1.45$M_{\odot}$ with initial mass ratio $q_{\rm i}=1.5$ and initial orbital
period $P_{\rm i}=0.8$ days, indicating that case A is a more likely
evolutionary channel than case B to form this object. The simulation also shows
that it is very likely that F190 is still in a slow stage of mass transfer. As
a consequence, obvious CNO abundance abnormalities should be observed for the
object.

are commonly referred to as `stellar pulsations'. Observed pulsational
characteristics are determined by fundamental stellar parameters. Consequently,
investigations of stellar pulsations provide a unique opportunity to verify and
refine our understanding of the evolution and internal structure of stars.
However, a key boundary condition for this analysis -- precise information
about the geometry of pulsations in the outer stellar envelopes -- has been
notoriously difficult to secure. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to
solve this problem by constructing an `image' of the pulsation velocity field
from time series observations of stellar spectra. This technique is applied to
study the geometry of nonradial pulsations in a prototype magnetic oscillating
(roAp) star HR 3831. Our velocity map directly demonstrates an alignment of
pulsations with the axis of the global magnetic field and reveals a significant
magnetically induced distortion of pulsations. This observation constitutes a
long-sought solution of the problem of the pulsation geometry of roAp stars and
enables very stringent tests of the recent theories of stellar magneto-acoustic
oscillations.

equation. Some Weyl group acts on a family of rational varieties obtained by
successive blow-ups at $m$ points in $\mpp^n(\mc)$, and in many cases they
include the affine Weyl groups with symmetric Cartan matrices as subgroups. It
is shown that the dynamical systems obtained by translations of these affine
Weyl groups possess commuting flows and that their degrees grow quadratically.
For the $E_7^{(1)}$ and $E_8^{(1)}$ cases, existence of preserved quantities is
investigated. The elliptic difference case is also studied.

supersymmetrical versions of dynamical systems (Morse system, Poschl-Teller
system, fractional supersymmetric oscillator of order k, etc.). The case of
ordinary supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics corresponds to k=2. A connection
between fractional supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and ordinary supersymmetric
Quantum Mechanics is briefly described. A realization of the algebra W_k, of
the N=2 supercharges and of the corresponding Hamiltonian is given in terms of
deformed-bosons and k-fermions as well as in terms of differential operators.

resonance (NMR) quantum computation is not yet well-understood. In particular,
despite the success of quantum information processing with NMR, recent work has
shown that quantum states used in most of those experiments were not entangled.
This is because these states, derived by unitary transforms from the thermal
equilibrium state, were too close to the maximally mixed state. We are thus
motivated to determine whether a given NMR state is entanglable - that is, does
there exist a unitary transform that entangles the state? The boundary between
entanglable and nonentanglable thermal states is a function of the spin system
size $N$ and its temperature $T$. We provide new bounds on the location of this
boundary using analytical and numerical methods; our tightest bound scales as
$N \sim T$, giving a lower bound requiring at least $N \sim 22,000$ proton
spins to realize an entanglable thermal state at typical laboratory NMR
magnetic fields. These bounds are tighter than known bounds on the
entanglability of effective pure states.

frequency conversion in optically isotropic materials. The phase-matching
mechanism proposed here is a combination of form birefringence and phase
velocity dispersion in a periodic structure. Since the phase-matching relies on
the geometry of the photonic crystal, it becomes possible to use highly
non-linear materials. This is illustrated considering a one-dimensional
periodic Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As / air structure for the generation of 1.5
$\mu$m light. We show that phase-matching conditions used in schemes to create
entangled photon pairs can be achieved in photonic crystals.

is a very strange phenomena. We find two possible ways of getting our desired
pure entangled state which is incomparable with the given input state, by
collective LOCC with certainty. The first one is by providing some pure
entanglement through the lower dimensional maximally-entangled states or using
further less amount of entanglement and the next one is by collective operation
on two pairs which are individually incomparable. It is quite surprising that
we are able to achieve maximally entangled states of any Schmidt rank from a
finite number of $2\times 2$ pure entangled states only by deterministic LOCC.
We provide general theory for the case of $3\times3$ system of incomparable
states by the above processes where incomparability seems to be the most
hardest one.
