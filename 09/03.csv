consistent with synchrotron emission from highly relativistic electron-positron
pairs produced by dark matter particle annihilation. More conventional sources
for this emission, such as free-free (thermal bremsstrahlung), thermal dust,
spinning dust, and the softer Galactic synchrotron traced by low-frequency
surveys, have been ruled out. The total power observed in the range 23 < nu <
61 GHz is between 10^{36} and 5x10^{36} erg/s, depending on the method of
extrapolation to the Galactic center, where bright foreground emission obscures
the signal. The inferred electron energy distribution is diffusion hardened,
and is in qualitative agreement with the energy distribution required to
explain the gamma ray excess in the inner Galaxy at 1-30 GeV as inverse-Compton
scattered starlight. We investigate the possibility that this population of
electrons is produced by dark matter annihilation of 100 GeV particles, with
cross section <sigma v>=2x10^{-26} cm^3/s, and an 1/r dark matter mass profile
truncated in the inner Galaxy, and find this scenario to be consistent with
current data.

constrained using lensed arcs at different redshifts behind cluster lenses.
Arcs trace the critical curves of clusters, and the growth of critical curves
with source redshift is sensitive to the dark-energy equation of state. Using
analytical models and numerically simulated clusters, we explore the key
factors involved in using cluster arcs as a probe of dark energy. We quantify
the sensitivity to lens mass, concentration and ellipticity with analytical
models that include the effects of dark energy on halo structure. We show with
simple examples how degeneracies between mass models and cosmography may be
broken using arcs at multiple redshifts or additional constraints on the lens
density profile. However we conclude that the requirements on the data are so
stringent that it is very unlikely that robust constraints can be obtained from
individual clusters. We argue that surveys of clusters, analyzed in conjunction
with numerical simulations, are a more promising prospect for arc-cosmography.
  We use such numerically simulated clusters to estimate how large a sample of
clusters/arcs could provide interesting constraints on dark energy models. We
focus on the scatter produced by differences in the mass distribution of
individual clusters. We find from our sample of simulated clusters that at
least 1000 pairs of arcs are needed to obtain constraints if the mass
distribution of individual clusters is taken to be undetermined. We discuss
several unsolved problems that need study to fully develop this method for
precision studies with future surveys.

information for 211 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed as untriggered events by
the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), and published in catalogs by
Kommers et al. (2001) and Stern et al. (2001). IPN confirmations have been
obtained by analyzing the data from 11 experiments. For any given burst
observed by BATSE and one other distant spacecraft, arrival time analysis (or
``triangulation'') results in an annulus of possible arrival directions whose
half-width varies between 14 arcseconds and 5.6 degrees, depending on the
intensity, time history, and arrival direction of the burst, as well as the
distance between the spacecraft. This annulus generally intersects the BATSE
error circle, resulting in a reduction of the area of up to a factor of ~650.
When three widely separated spacecraft observed a burst, the result is an error
box whose area is as much as 30000 times smaller than that of the BATSE error
circle.
  Because the IPN instruments are considerably less sensitive than BATSE, they
generally did not detect the weakest untriggered bursts, but did detect the
more intense ones which failed to trigger BATSE when the trigger was disabled.
In a few cases, we have been able to identify the probable origin of bursts as
soft gamma repeaters. The vast majority of the IPN-detected events, however,
are GRBs, and the confirmation of them validates many of the procedures
utilized to detect BATSE untriggered bursts.

of the k/f ratio on any physical parameter of the cluster or the radio source.
The distribution of the upper limit on k/f appears to be bimodal, the value for

the composition of the jet which forms the bubbles, the variation in the volume

CO emission extends from 1.2"" to 7"" in radius from the central star and appears
consistent with a simple expanding envelope, as expected for a post-AGB star.
We quantitatively model the molecular envelope using a radiative transfer code
that we have modified for detached shells. Our best fit model reveals that two
sequential winds created the circumstellar envelope of HD 56126: an AGB wind
that lasted 6500 years with a mass-loss rate of 5.1x10^{-6} M_odot yr^{-1} and
a more intense superwind that lasted 840 years with a mass-loss rate of
3x10^{-5} M_odot yr^{-1} and that ended the star's life on the AGB 1240 years
ago. The total mass of this envelope is 0.059 M_odot which indicates a lower
limit progenitor mass for the system of 0.66 M_odot, quite reasonable for this
low-metallicity star which probably resides in the thick disk of the Galaxy.
Comparison with images of the dust emission reveal a similar structure with the
gas in the inner regions. Using 2-DUST, we model the dust emission of this
source so that the model is consistent with the CO emission model and find an
average gas-to-dust mass ratio of 75.

association between low-redshift galaxies and high-redshift quasi-stellar
objects, suggesting noncosmological origin of their redshift and failure of
classical quasar explanation. Here we find an analytical solution of Einstein
equations describing bubbles made from axions with periodic interaction
potential. Such particles are currently considered as one of the leading dark
matter candidate. The bubble interior has equal gravitational potential and,
hence, photons emitted from the interior possess identical gravitational
redshift. The redshift depends on the bubble mass and can have any value
between zero and infinity. Quantum pressure supports the bubble against
collapse and yields states stable on the scale of the Universe age. Our results
explain the observed quantization of quasar redshift and suggest that
intrinsically faint point-like quasars associated with nearby galaxies (a few %
of known objects) are axionic bubbles with masses 10^8-10^9 M_{Sun} and radii
10^3-10^4 R_{Sun}. They are born in active galaxies and ejected into
surrounding space. Properties of such quasars unambiguously indicate presence
of axion dark matter in the Universe and yield the axion mass m=0.4-3 meV,
which fits in the open axion mass window constrained by astrophysical and
cosmological arguments. We also found that tachyons, another dark matter
candidate, can form objects with galactic size, negligible mass and any value
of the gravitational redshift. Such finding combined with quasar observations
suggests that bright quasars 3C 48, 3C 273 and 3C 279 are nuclei of forming

and H2O (Cheung et al, 1969) such microwave lasers have been found to work in
more than 100 molecular species (Elitzur, 1992; Townes, 1997), as well as in
highly excited H atoms (Strelnitski et al,1996). In the IR region (10 microns),
the effect of stimulated emission of radiation in the CO2 molecule has been
discovered in the Martian and Venus' atmospheres (Betz et al, 1976; Mumma et
al, 1981). We report here on the discovery of laser action in the range 0.9-2
micr. in several spectral lines of Fe II, which are associated with transitions
from ""pseudo-metastable"" states populated by spontaneous transitions from
Ly-alpha pumped Fe II levels. The intense Ly-alpha radiation is formed in the
HII region of gas condensations close to the star Eta Carinae. The laser
transitions form together with spontaneous transitions closed radiative cycles,
one of which includes the extremely bright 2507/09 A lines. Closed radiative
cycles, together with an accidental mixing of energy levels, may provide an
explanation of the abnormal intensities of these UV non-lasing lines. Using the
complicated energy level diagram of Fe II we present those peculiar features,
which are essential for the inverted population and laser effect: the pumping,
the level mixing, and the ""bottle neck"" for spontaneous decay. The laser action
is a new indicator of non-equilibrium and spatially non-homogeneous physical
conditions as well as a high brightness temperature of Ly-alpha in ejecta from
eruptive stars. Such conditions are very difficult to probe by existing
methods, and we propose some future experiments. The fact, that the lasing
near-IR lines appear in the spectrum with about the same inten- sity as
non-lasing lines is discussed and compared with the situation in masers.

two dominant clumps of galaxies: a main cluster centred on the BCG (A3921-A),
and a NW sub-cluster (A3921-B) hosting the second brightest cluster galaxy. The
distorted morphology of the two sub-clusters suggests that they are
interacting, while the velocity distribution of 104 confirmed cluster members
does not reveal strong signatures of merging. By applying a two-body dynamical
formalism to the two sub-clusters of A3921, and by comparing our optical
results to the X-ray analysis of A3921 based on XMM observations (Belsole et
al. 2004), we conclude that A3921-B is probably tangentially traversing the
main cluster along a SW/NE direction. Our estimate of the star formation
properties of the cluster members reveals substantial fractions of both
emission-line (~13%) and post-star-forming objects (k+a's,~16%). A lack of
bright k+a's with respect to higher redshift clusters is observed, while the
fraction of k+a's increases towards fainter magnitudes. The spatial and
velocity distributions of k+a's galaxies, their red colours and their moderate
Balmer absorption lines suggest that their presence is difficult to relate to
the on-going merging event. Star forming galaxies, which are mostly
concentrated in A3921-B and between the two sub-clusters, share neither the

mimics dynamically effects of global rotation. The significance of the global
rotation of the Universe for the resolution of the acceleration and horizon
problems in cosmology is investigated. It is found that dynamics of the
Universe can be reduced to the two-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical system.
Then the construction of the Hamiltonian allows for full classification of
evolution paths. On the phase portraits we find the domains of cosmic
acceleration for the globally rotating universe as well as the trajectories for
which the horizon problem is solved. We show that the FRW models with global
rotation are structurally stable. This proves that the universe acceleration is
due to the global rotation. It is also shown how global rotation gives a
natural explanation of the empirical relation between angular momentum for
clusters and superclusters of galaxies. The relation $J \sim M^2$ is obtained
as a consequence of self similarity invariance of the dynamics of the FRW model
with global rotation. In derivation of this relation we use the Lie group of

that void galaxies have younger stellar populations than wall galaxies. Using

implicit ingredient of Fermi-type particle acceleration scenarios.
Non-relativistic thermal gas in AGN jets noticably contributes to the optical
depth at radio to infrared frequencies, and much less to the emission, with an
efficiency that is strongly temperature-dependent. The observable flux of
low-frequency emission is thus modulated by the temperature evolution of the
thermal gas, and it can therefore display very complicated variability. For a
particular particle energisation scenario we calculate the temperature
evolution of the thermal plasma as well as the radiation transport of

varying the intensity of a direct nearest-neighbor interaction between the

phase in the case of fermions and via vertical (horizontal) striped phases in

if the strongest effective interaction in the fermionic case gets frustrated
gently, then the phase diagram becomes similar to that of the bosonic case.

of crystals is derived starting from the Hartree-Fock approximation. It is
based on the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the self-energy
which is formulated for crystal orbitals (CO-ADC). In this approach, the poles
of the Green's function are determined by solving a suitable Hermitian
eigenvalue problem. The method is not only applicable to the outer valence and
conduction bands, it is also stable for inner valence bands where strong
electron correlations are effective. The key to the proposed scheme is to
evaluate the self-energy in terms of Wannier orbitals before transforming it to
a crystal momentum representation. Exploiting the fact that electron
correlations are mainly local, one can truncate the lattice summations by an
appropriate configuration selection scheme. This yields a flat configuration
space; i.e., its size scales only linearly with the number of atoms per unit
cell for large systems and, under certain conditions, the computational effort
to determine band structures also scales linearly. As a first application of
the new formalism, a lithium fluoride crystal has been chosen. A minimal basis
set description is studied, and a satisfactory agreement with previous
theoretical and experimental results for the fundamental band gap and the width

  approved May 2004. v2: references added",,,,"hep-th",,"  In this dissertation we discuss various issues concerning application of the
Dijkgraaf-Vafa (DV) conjecture to the study of supersymmetric gauge theories.
The DV approach is very powerful in that it provides a systematic way of
computing the nonperturbative, often even exact, superpotential of the system,
which was possible only on a case-by-case basis in the more traditional
approach based on holomorphy and symmetry.
  This conjecture has been checked for many nontrivial examples, but the range
of its applicability remained unclear. We give an explicit example, Sp(N)
theory with antisymmetric tensor, which reveals the subtleties in applying the
conjecture. We show that, the superpotential obtained by a straightforward
application of the DV approach starts to disagree with the standard gauge
theory result at N/2+1 loops. The same discrepancy is reproduced in the
generalized Konishi anomaly method.
  In order to look for the physical origin of the discrepancy, we consider the
string theory realization of the gauge theories by Calabi-Yau
compactifications. By closely analyzing the physics that accompanies the
geometric transitions involved, we clarify the prescription regarding when to
include a glueball field as the physical field, and when to not. In particular,
the aforementioned discrepancy is resolved if we follow this prescription and
introduce a glueball field for the ""Sp(0)"" group.
  Furthermore, we generalize the prescription to include flavors and
demonstrate that the matrix model computations with the generalized
prescription correctly reproduce the gauge theory results.

energy of the corresponding Fock states which ensures that the system is in a
stable configuration against gravitational collapse and imposing a cutoff on
the maximum energy of the field modes of the order of the Planck energy leads
to an entropy bound of holographic type. A simple derivation of the entropy
bound is also given for the fermionic case.

theories, but the approach applies to non-relativistic ones as well.
  In this quasi-particle re-summation, the free energy takes the free-field
form but with the one-particle energy $\omega (\vec{k})$ replaced by $\vep
(\vec{k})$, the latter satisfying a temperature-dependent integral equation
with kernel related to a zero temperature form-factor of the trace of
stress-energy tensor. For 2D integrable theories the approach reduces to the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. For relativistic theories, a thermal c-function
$C_{\rm qs} (T)$ is defined for any $D$ based on the coefficient of the black
body radiation formula. Thermodynamical constraints on it's flow are presented,
showing that it can violate a ``c-theorem'' even in 2D. At a fixed point
$C_{\rm qs}$ is a function of thermal gap parameters which generalizes Roger's
dilogarithm to higher dimensions. This points to a strategy for classifying
rational theories based on ``polylogarithmic ladders'' in mathematics, and many
examples are worked out. An argument suggests that the 3D Ising model has
$C_{\rm qs} = 7/8$. (In 3D a free fermion has $C_{\rm qs} = 3/4$.) Other
applications are discussed, including the free energy of anyons in 2D and 3D,
phase transitions with a chemical potential, and the equation of state for

state is presented for reaction-diffusion systems. For this formalism, we use
the so-called Kuramoto length, a typical distance over which a molecule
diffuses in its lifetime, as was originally introduced to determine if local
fluctuations influence globally the whole system. We show that this Kuramoto
length is also relevant to determine whether the discreteness of molecules is
significant or not. If the number of molecules of a certain species within the
Kuramoto length is small and discrete, localization of some other chemicals is
brought about, which can accelerate certain reactions. When this acceleration
influences the concentration of the original molecule species, it is shown that
a novel, stochastic steady state is induced that does not appear in the
continuum limit. A theory to obtain and characterize this state is introduced,
based on the self-consistent equation for chemical concentrations. This
stochastic steady state is confirmed by numerical simulations on a certain
reaction model, which agrees well with the theoretical estimation. Formation
and coexistence of domains with different stochastic states are also reported,
which is maintained by the discreteness. Relevance of our result to
intracellular reactions is briefly discussed.

loss into the Hamilton-Jacobi equation we derive in an elementary fashion the
