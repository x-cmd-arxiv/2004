temperature from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The cross section for
de-exciting the 21-cm trasition in collisions with free electrons is more than
10 times larger than it is in collisions with other atoms. If the fraction of
free electrons in the diffuse cosmic gas is between 10 and 30 per cent then
collisions alone can decouple the spin temperature from the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), even in moderately under-dense regions at z >15. This
decoupling is especially important during the very early stages of
re-ionization when a Ly-alpha continuum background had yet to be established.
As a detailed example, we develop a semi-analytic model to quantify 21-cm
emission signatures from a diffuse gas which is partially ionized at z>10 by an
X-ray background. We find 21-cm differential brightness temperature
fluctuations with a mean of ~8 mK and a rms value as large as 5 mK, for a
frequency resolution bandwidth of 100 KHz and a beamsize of 3 arcmin. Another
example where free electron-atom collisions are important is during the
recombination of bubbles ionized by short-lived UV sources. When the ionized
fraction in these bubbles drops to 10-20 per cent their differential
temperature can be as high as 10 mK. We also consider the correlation of the
21-cm temperature as a function of frequency. By isotropy, a comparison with
the angular projected correlation in the plane of the sky should yield an
estimate for the matter density parameter, Omega_m, and the dark energy
component. This variant of the Alcock-Paczyski test is applicable for any
reionization scenario.

which have core-jet radio structures measured with VLBI and have flat spectra
stretching from the radio to the millimetre/sub-millimetre band. Thus the
objects have most of the properties expected of blazars. However, they display
varied optical properties ranging from ``Seyfert-like'' objects, through BL Lac
objects, to ``normal'' elliptical galaxies. We investigate the distribution of
synchrotron peak frequencies in their Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and
find a broad distribution between 10^12 and 10^16 Hz. Our conclusion is that we
should consider virtually all objects in the sample as blazars since much of
the diversity in their classification based on traditional optical criteria
arises from differences in the frequency at which the non-thermal emission
begins to decline. Specifically, an object is only classified as BL Lac when
its peak frequency falls in the near IR/optical range.
  We determine peak frequencies using the same method for objects from other
blazar samples. An important result is that our objects do not follow the
blazar spectral sequence proposed by Fossati et al. and Ghisellini et al. in
which, on average, peak frequencies increase as the radio luminosity decreases.
Most of our low radio-luminosity sources have peaks in their SEDs at low
frequencies, not at the expected high frequencies. We suggest that at least
part of the systematic trend seen by Fossati et al. and Ghisellini et al.
results from selection effects.

of the betatron oscillations is retained. A short azimuthal wavelength
instability is found which causes a modulation of the charge and current

azimuthal wavenumber, a decreasing function of the Lorentz factor, and
proportional to the square root of the total number of electrons. We argue that
the growth of the unstable perturbation saturates when the trapping frequency
of electrons in the wave becomes comparable to the growth rate. Owing to this
saturation we can predict the radiation spectrum for a given set of parameters.
Our predicted brightness temperatures are proportional to the square of the

radiated back into the accretion disk. When the accretion rate is high, such as
in dwarf novae, symbiotic binaries, and supersoft sources, the material spreads
to higher latitudes to be more easily observed. The SL may contain shallow
surface modes, and we propose that such waves could produce dwarf nova

We investigate one realization of this idea, that the dark energy field might
be a decayed scalar component of a supermultiplet field in the early universe

field. To investigate this possibility, the cosmological Friedmann equation of
energy balance is augmented in a standard way to incorporate a minimally
coupled cosmological Higgs. For epochs where the expansion of the universe is
driven by matter and radiation and not the scalar field, the observed hidden
nature of the Higgs field can be codified into a single differential equation
that we call the ""hidden higgs"" condition. The resulting differential equation
is solved for the time dependant scalar field and a simple and interesting
solution is found analytically. Such a Higgs field decays from Planck scale
energies rapidly and approximately exponentially from onset, leaving only the
initially negligible constant term of the potential as a final cosmological
constant. Such evolution replaces the hierarchy problem with the problem of
explaining why such evolution is physically justified.

usually compared to observations by relying on the emission-weighted

al. show that, if the cluster is thermally complex, T_ew fails at reproducing
T_spec, and propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-like temperature, T_sl,
which approximates T_spec better than a few per cent. By analyzing a set of
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, we find that T_sl is lower than
T_ew by 20-30 per cent. As a consequence, the normalization of the M-T_sl
relation from the simulations is larger than the observed one by about 50 per
cent. If masses in simulated clusters are estimated by following the same
assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and \beta--model gas density profile, as
often done for observed clusters, then the M-T relation decreases by about 40
per cent, and significantly reduces its scatter. Based on this result, we
conclude that using the observed M-T relation to infer the amplitude of the
power spectrum from the X-ray temperature function could bias low \sigma_8 by
10-20 per cent. This may alleviate the tension between the value of \sigma_8
inferred from the cluster number density and those from cosmic microwave

0.5 at z=3, for both 3D and 2D ellipticities; the evolution is well-fit by

the increase of ellipticities with redshift is preserved. Using the fitted

a complex history to cosmic reionization. Such a history requires some form of
feedback to extend reionization over a long time interval, but the nature of
the feedback and how rapidly it operates remain highly uncertain. Here we focus
on one aspect of this complexity: which physical processes can cause the global
ionized fraction to evolve non-monotonically with cosmic time? We consider a
range of mechanisms and conclude that double reionization is much less likely
than a long, but still monotonic, ionization history. We first examine how
galactic winds affect the transition from metal-free to normal star formation.
Because the transition is actually spatially inhomogeneous and temporally
extended, this mechanism cannot be responsible for double reionization given
plausible parameters for the winds. We next consider photoheating, which causes
the cosmological Jeans mass to increase in ionized regions and hence suppresses
galaxy formation there. In this case, double reionization requires that small
halos form stars efficiently, that the suppression from photoheating is strong
relative to current expectations, and that ionizing photons are preferentially
produced outside of previously ionized regions. Finally, we consider H_2
photodissociation, in which the buildup of a soft ultraviolet background
suppresses star formation in small halos. This can in principle cause the
ionized fraction to temporarily decrease, but only during the earliest stages
of reionization. Finally, we briefly consider the effects of some of these
feedback mechanisms on the topology of reionization.

stellar evolution calculations amenable to direct observational testing. In the
first paper in the series (Young et al. 2001) we established baseline results
using only physics which are common to modern stellar evolution codes. In the
current paper we establish how much of the discrepancy between observations and
baseline models is due to particular elements of new physics. We then consider
the impact of the observational uncertainties on the maximum predictive
accuracy achievable by a stellar evolution code. The sun is an optimal case
because of the precise and abundant observations and the relative simplicity of
the underlying stellar physics. The Standard Model is capable of matching the
structure of the sun as determined by helioseismology and gross surface
observables to better than a percent. Given an initial mass and surface
composition within the observational errors, and no additional constraints for
which the models can be optimized, it is not possible to predict the sun's
current state to better than ~7%. Convectively induced mixing in radiative
regions, seen in multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations, dramatically
improves the predictions for radii, luminosity, and apsidal motions of
eclipsing binaries while simultaneously maintaining consistency with observed
light element depletion and turnoff ages in young clusters (Young et al. 2003).
Systematic errors in core size for models of massive binaries disappear with
more complete mixing physics, and acceptable fits are achieved for all of the
binaries without calibration of free parameters. The lack of accurate abundance

interest as to its origin. The recent detections of CSE emission at large
cluster radii together with reports of OVII line emission associated with the
CSE has led many authors to conjecture that the CSE is, in fact, a signature of
the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this paper we test the scenario by
comparing the observed properties of the CSE with predictions based on models
of the WHIM. We find that emission from the WHIM in current models is 3 to 4
orders of magnitude too faint to explain the CSE. We discuss different
possibilities for this discrepancy including issues of simulation resolution
and scale, and the role of small density enhancements or galaxy groups. Our
final conclusion is that the WHIM alone is unlikely to be able to accout for
the observed flux of the CSE.

point of view but with an observer's perspective, the usage of light echoes
(LEs) to probe the CSM around SNe of Type Ia since, in principle, they give us
a unique opportunity of getting a three-dimensional description of the SN
environment. In turn, this can be used to check the often suggested association
of some Ia's with dusty/star forming regions, which would point to a young
population for the progenitors. After giving a brief introduction to the LE
phenomenon in single scattering approximation, I derive analytical and
numerical solutions for the optical light and colour curves for a few simple
dust geometries. A fully 3D multiple scattering treatment has also been
implemented in a Monte Carlo code, which I have used to investigate the effects
of multiple scattering. In particular, I have explored in detail the LE colour
dependency from time and dust distribution, since this is a promising tool to
determine the dust density and derive the effective presence of multiple
scattering from the observed properties. Finally, again by means of Monte Carlo
simulations, I have studied the effects of multiple scattering on the LE linear
polarization, analyzing the dependencies from the dust parameters and geometry.
Both the analytical formalism and MC codes described in this paper can be used
for any LE for which the light curve of the central source is known.

bulge stars. The method is applied to three Gaia instruments, the BBP and MBP
photometers, and the RVS spectrograph. We conclude that, while in the BBP most
of the bulge will be accessible, in the MBP there will be a small but
significant number of regions where bulge stars will be detected and accurately
measured in crowded fields. Assuming that the RVS spectra may be extracted in
moderately crowded fields, the bulge will be accessible in most regions apart

much interest as gravitational wave sources and gamma--ray burst progenitors.
Numerical studies show that in general the neutron star is not disrupted at the
first phase of mass transfer. Instead, what remains of the neutron star is left
on a wider, eccentric, orbit. We consider the evolution of such systems as they
lose angular momentum via gravitational radiation and come into contact for
further phases of mass transfer. During each mass transfer event the neutron
star mass is reduced until a critical value where mass loss leads to a rapid
increase in the stellar radius. At this point Roche lobe overflow shreds what
remains of the neutron star, most of the mass forming a disc around the black
hole. Such a disc may be massive enough to power a gamma--ray burst. The mass
of the neutron star at the time of disruption (and therefore the disc mass) is
largely independent of the initial masses of the black hole and neutron star,
indicating that BH--NS star mergers may be standard candles.

electrons and holes (unoccupied states in a filled electron sea). Electron-hole
symmetry can often be invoked as a simplifying description, which states that
electrons with energy above the Fermi sea behave the same as holes below the
Fermi energy. In semiconductors, however, electron-hole symmetry is generally
absent since the energy band structure of the conduction band differs from the
valence band. Here we report on measurements of the discrete, quantized-energy
spectrum of electrons and holes in a semiconducting carbon nanotube. Through a
gate, an individual nanotube is filled controllably with a precise number of
either electrons or holes, starting from one. The discrete excitation spectrum
for a nanotube with N holes is strikingly similar to the corresponding spectrum
for N electrons. This observation of near perfect electron-hole symmetry
demonstrates for the first time that a semiconducting nanotube can be free of
charged impurities, even in the limit of few-electrons or holes. We furthermore
find an anomalously small Zeeman spin splitting and an excitation spectrum
indicating strong electron-electron interactions.

We briefly discuss the tilting Bianchi type V models and the late-time
asymptotic behaviour of irrotational Bianchi VII$_0$ models. We prove the
important result that for non-inflationary Bianchi type VII$_h$ models vacuum
plane-wave solutions are the only future attracting equilibrium points in the
Bianchi type VII$_h$ invariant set. We then investigate the dynamics close to
the plane-wave solutions in more detail, and discover some new features that
arise in the dynamical behaviour of Bianchi cosmologies with the inclusion of
tilt. We point out that in a tiny open set of parameter space in the type IV
model (the loophole) there exists closed curves which act as attracting limit
cycles. More interestingly, in the Bianchi type VII$_h$ models there is a
bifurcation in which a set of equilibrium points turn into closed orbits. There
is a region in which both sets of closed curves coexist, and it appears that
for the type VII$_h$ models in this region the solution curves approach a
compact surface which is topologically a torus.

provides an everlasting process of evolution ($\Lambda < 0$), whereas, for some
positive values of $\Lambda$ and the bulk viscosity being inverse proportional
to the expansion, the BI Universe admits a singularity-free oscillatory mode of
expansion. In case of a constant bulk viscosity and share viscosity being

re-examined from an operational point of view, with particular emphasis on the
status of Einstein synchronization in the light of the possibility of arbitrary
synchronization procedures in inertial reference frames. Once correctly and
explicitly phrased, the principles of SRT allow for a wide range of `theories'
that differ from the standard SRT only for the difference in the chosen
synchronization procedures, but are wholly equivalent to SRT in predicting
empirical facts. This results in the introduction, in the full background of
SRT, of a suitable synchronization gauge. A complete hierarchy of
synchronization gauges is introduced and elucidated, ranging from the useful
Selleri synchronization gauge (which should lead, according to Selleri, to a
multiplicity of theories alternative to SRT) to the more general Mansouri-Sexl
synchronization gauge and, finally, to the even more general
Anderson-Vetharaniam-Stedman's synchronization gauge. It is showed that all
these gauges do not challenge the SRT, as claimed by Selleri, but simply lead
to a number of formalisms which leave the geometrical structure of Minkowski
spacetime unchanged. Several aspects of fundamental and applied interest
related to the conventional aspect of the synchronization choice are discussed,
encompassing the issue of the one-way velocity of light on inertial and
rotating reference frames, the GPS's working, and the recasting of Maxwell
equations in generic synchronizations. Finally, it is showed how the gauge
freedom introduced in SRT can be exploited in order to give a clear explanation
of the Sagnac effect for counter-propagating matter beams.

the temperature of the transition from the hadronic phase to the quark gluon
plasma phase using two different methods. We find that the critical
temperatures derived in both methods are in very good agreement. We find that
the critical surface has a small curvature. We also find that the critical
temperature's dependence on the baryon chemical potential at zero isospin
chemical potential is almost identical to its dependence on the isospin
chemical potential at vanishing baryon chemical potential. This result, which
holds when the chemical potentials are small, supports recent lattice
simulation studies. Finally, we find that at a given baryon chemical potential,
the critical temperature is lowered as either the isospin or the strangeness
chemical potential are increased. Therefore, in order to lower the critical
temperature, it might be useful to use different isotopes in heavy ion
collision experiments.

color-suppressed neutral modes such as $B^0\to
D^0\pi^0,\pi^0\pi^0,\rho^0\pi^0,K^0\pi^0$ can be substantially enhanced by
long-distance rescattering effects. The direct CP-violating partial rate
asymmetries in charmless B decays to $\pi\pi/\pi K$ and $\rho\pi$ are
significantly affected by final-state rescattering and their signs are
generally different from that predicted by the short-distance approach. For
example, direct CP asymmetry in $B^0\to\rho^0\pi^0$ is increased to around 60%
due to final state rescattering effects whereas the short-distance picture
gives about 1%. Evidence of direct CP violation in the decay $\bar B^0\to
K^-\pi^+$ is now established, while the combined BaBar and Belle measurements
of $\bar B^0\to\rho^\pm\pi^\mp$ imply a $3.6\sigma$ direct CP asymmetry in the
$\rho^+\pi^-$ mode. Our predictions for CP violation agree with experiment in
both magnitude and sign, whereas the QCD factorization predictions seem to have
some difficulty with the data. Current data on $\pi K$ modes seem to violate
the isospin sum rule relation, suggesting the presence of electroweak penguin
contributions. We have also investigated whether a large transverse
polarization in $B\to \phi K^*$ can arise from the final-state rescattering of

dependance. We show that in the case of the minimal supersymmetric standard

regions of high density surrounded by low-density walls, in contrast to the
case of the minimal standard model. In this supersymmetric extension we find
that density contrasts of up to a factor of 100 may arise. This amplitude
increases for higher values of the latent heat or lower values of the bubble
wall tension, and can be significantly larger in different extensions of the

  and 22 figures",,,,"hep-th",,"  This thesis concerns the large-N limit, a classical limit where fluctuations
in gauge-invariant variables vanish. The large dimension limit for
rotation-invariant variables in atoms is given as an example of a classical
limit other than hbar vanishing. Part I concerns the baryon in Rajeev's
reformulation of 2d QCD in the large-N limit: a non-linear classical theory of
color-singlet quark bilinears. 't Hooft's meson equation is the linearization
around the vacuum on the curved grassmannian phase space. The baryon is a
topological soliton. Its form factor is found variationally on a succession of
increasing rank submanifolds of the phase space. These reduced systems are
interacting parton models: a derivation of parton model from the soliton
picture. A rank-1 ansatz leads to a Hartree approximation: a relativistic 2d
realization of Witten's proposal. The baryon form factor is used to model x_B
dependence of deep inelastic structure functions. In Part II, euclidean large-N
multi-matrix models are reformulated as classical systems for U(N) invariants.
The configuration space of gluon correlations is a space of non-commutative
probability distributions. Classical equations of motion (factorized loop
equations) contain an anomaly that leads to a cohomological obstruction to
finding an action principle. This is circumvented by expressing the
configuration space as a coset space of the automorphism group of the tensor
algebra. The action principle is interpreted as the Legendre transform of the
entropy of operator-valued random variables. The free energy and correlations
in the large-N limit are found variationally. The simplest variational ansatz
is an analogue of mean-field theory and compares well with exact and numerical
solutions of 1 and 2 matrix models away from phase transitions.

suggest an alternative model for cold dark matter. At late times, when the low

dynamics, the moduli will begin to slow-roll and stabilization will generically
fail. However, stabilization can be recovered by considering cosmological
particle production near the points of enhanced symmetry leading to the process

down randomly into pieces as time passes. They can be thought of as continuous
time analogs of a certain type of branching random walks, which suggests the
use of time-discretization to shift known results from the theory of branching
random walks to the fragmentation setting. In particular, this yields
interesting information about the asymptotic behaviour of fragmentations.
  On the other hand, homogeneous fragmentations can also be investigated using
a powerful technique of discretization of space due to Kingman, namely, the
theory of exchangeable partitions of $\N$. Spatial discretization is especially
well-suited to develop directly for continuous times the conceptual method of
probability tilting of Lyons, Pemantle and Peres.

under an $X \log X$ condition, the quotient $P(\zeta_n > 0)/ E\zeta_n$ has a
finite positive limit. There is an analogous result for a (one-dimensional)
supercritical branching random walk: when $a$ is in the so-called subcritical
speed area, the probability of presence around $na$ in the $n$-th generation is
asymptotically proportional to the corresponding expectation. In Rouault (1993)
this result was stated under a natural $X \log X$ assumption on the offspring
point process and a (unnatural) condition on the offspring mean. Here we prove
that the result holds without this latter condition, in particular we allow an
infinite mean and a dimension $d \geq 1$ for the state-space. As a consequence
the result holds also for homogeneous fragmentations as defined in Bertoin
(2001), using the method of discrete-time skeletons; this completes the proof
of Theorem 4 in Bertoin-Rouault (2004 see math/PR/0409545). Finally, an
application to conditioning on the presence allows to meet again the
probability tilting and the so-called additive martingale.

alpha-decay energies and half-lives are reproduced well by this Lagrangian
model. Further calculations for the heavier elements with Z=117-125 show that
these nuclei are superdeformed with a prolate shape in the ground state. A
superdeformed shell-closure at Z=118 lends an additional binding and an extra
stability to nuclei in this region. Consequently, it is predicted that the
corresponding $Q_\alpha$ values provide $\alpha$-decay half-lives for heavier
superheavy nuclei within the experimentally feasible conditions. The results
are compared with those of macroscopic-microscopic approaches. A perspective of
the difference in shell effects amongst various approaches is presented and its
consequences on superheavy nuclei are discussed.

increases while the occupation of the neutron states is enhanced as compared to

slightly smaller energies as compared to the Brueckner Hartree Fock approach.
This effect increases with density and thereby modifies the saturation density

A Vol. 71, 012312 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.71.012312",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a theory for the estimation of a scalar or a vector magnetic field
by its influence on an ensemble of trapped spin polarized atoms. The atoms
interact off-resonantly with a continuous laser field, and the measurement of
the polarization rotation of the probe light, induced by the dispersive
atom-light coupling, leads to spin-squeezing of the atomic sample which enables
an estimate of the magnetic field which is more precise than that expected from
standard counting statistics. For polarized light and polarized atoms, a
description of the non-classical components of the collective spin angular
momentum for the atoms and the collective Stokes vectors of the light-field in
terms of effective gaussian position and momentum variables is practically
exact. The gaussian formalism describes the dynamics of the system very
effectively and accounts explicitly for the back-action on the atoms due to
measurement and for the estimate of the magnetic field. Multi-component
magnetic fields are estimated by the measurement of suitably chosen atomic
observables and precision and efficiency is gained by dividing the atomic gas
in two or more samples which are entangled by the dispersive atom-light
interaction.

considered to be evidence of their wavelike character, can be interpreted as a
scattering of pointlike objects by the periodic laser field.
