are relics of AGN activity. We compare the mass function of BHs in the local
universe with that expected from AGN relics, which are BHs grown entirely with
mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is
estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge
luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity
functions. The density of BHs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5
Msun Mpc-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity equation with the
only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto massive BHs and that
merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at z=0 is generated
mainly at z<3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense that
smaller BHs (MBH<10^7 Msun) grow at lower redshifts (z<1) with respect to more
massive ones (z~1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics
is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the local BHs were
mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying,
at the same time, the constraints imposed by the X-ray background. The
comparison with the local BHMF also suggests that the merging process is not
important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts (z<3). Our
analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local BHs grew during AGN phases
in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies
eff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the Eddington
luminosity. The average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.5
10^8 yr for MBH<10^7 Msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for MBH>10^9 Msun.

elliptical, with the centroid offset from the brightest cluster galaxy by 17
arcsec, and with a pronounced extension toward the NW. Subtraction of a 2D beta
model fit to the main cluster emission reveals a large scale, irregular
residual structure in the direction of the extension, containing both diffuse
emission from the intra cluster medium, and extended emission from the second
and third-brightest cluster galaxies (BG2 and BG3). The greatest concentration
of galaxies in the subcluster lies at the extreme northern edge of the
residual. The cluster exhibits a remarkable temperature structure, in
particular a bar of significantly hotter gas, oriented SE-NW and stretching
from the centre of the cluster towards BG2 and BG3. Our detailed study of the
morphological and thermal structure points to an off-axis merger between a main
cluster and a less massive galaxy cluster infalling from the SE. From
comparison of the temperature map with numerical simulations, and with
independent calculations based on simple physical assumptions, we conclude that
the merging event is ~0.5 Gyr old. The cluster is thus perhaps the best X-ray
observed candidate so far of an intermediate mass ratio, moderate impact
parameter merger.

magnetized neutron star with an aligned dipole field. The magnetospheric field
is assumed to thread the disk plasma both inside and outside the corotation
radius. As a result of disk-star interaction, the magnetic torque on the disk
affects the structure of accretion flow to yield the observed spin-up or
spin-down rates for a source of given fastness, magnetic field strength, and
mass accretion rate. Within the model we obtain a prescription for the
dynamical viscosity of such magnetically modified solutions for a Keplerian
disk. We then use this prescription to find a model solution for the rotation
rate profile throughout the entire disk including the non-Keplerian inner disk.
We find that the non-Keplerian angular velocity transition region is not
necessarily narrow for a source of given spin state. The boundary layer
approximation, as in the standard magnetically threaded disk model, holds only
in the case of dynamical viscosity decreasing all the way to the innermost edge
of the disk. These results are applied to several observed disk-fed X-ray
pulsars that have exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The QPO
frequencies provide a constraint on the fastness parameter and enable one to
determine uniquely the width of the angular velocity transition zone for each
source within model assumptions. We discuss the implications of these results
on the value of the critical fastness parameter for a magnetized star in spin
equilibrium. Applications of our model are also made with relevant parameters
from recent numerical simulations of quasi-stationary disk-magnetized star

to date among type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The [O III] emission lines
in both objects are broad (1000 - 2000 km/s) and those in DMS 0059-0055 show

Among type 1 AGNs with large blueshifted [O III], there is no correlation
between the Eddington ratios and the amount of [O III] blueshifts. Combining
our new data with published results, we confirm that the Eddington ratios of
the such AGNs are the highest among AGNs with the same black hole masses. These
facts suggest that the Eddington ratio is a necessary condition or the [O III]
blueshifts weakly depend on the Eddington ratio. Our new sample suggests that
there are possible necessary conditions to produce an outflow besides a high
Eddington ratio: large black hole mass (> 10^7 M_solar) or high mass accretion
rate (> 2 M_solar/yr) or large luminosity (lambda L_{lambda} (5100A) > 10^44.6

contributes to the global support of the clouds, while on the other it promotes
the formation of small-scale density fluctuations, identifiable with clumps and
cores. Within these, the local Jeans length $\Ljc$ is reduced, and collapse
ensues if $\Ljc$ becomes smaller than the clump size and the magnetic support
is insufficient (i.e., the core is ``magnetically supercritical''); otherwise,
the clumps do not collapse and are expected to re-expand and disperse on a few
free-fall times. This case may correspond to a fraction of the observed
starless cores. The star formation efficiency (SFE, the fraction of the cloud's
mass that ends up in collapsed objects) is smaller than unity because the mass
contained in collapsing clumps is smaller than the total cloud mass. However,
in non-magnetic numerical simulations with realistic Mach numbers and
turbulence driving scales, the SFE is still larger than observational
estimates. The presence of a magnetic field, even if magnetically
supercritical, appears to further reduce the SFE, but by reducing the
probability of core formation rather than by delaying the collapse of
individual cores, as was formerly thought. Precise quantification of these
effects as a function of global cloud parameters is still needed.

Are there really two separate populations, and if so, is the physics of the
radio emission fundamentally different between them? This paper addresses the
second question, through a study of radio variability across the full range of
radio power, from quiet to loud. The basic findings are that the root mean
square amplitude of variability is independent of radio luminosity or
radio-to-optical flux density ratio, and that fractionally large variations can
occur on timescales of months or less in both radio quiet and radio loud
quasars. Combining this with similarities in other indicators, such as radio
spectral index and the presence of VLBI-scale components, leads to the
suggestion that the physics of radio emission in the inner regions of all

deposition was strictly at the apex). This left outstanding questions: A) is
the generation of the 2nd harmonic a consequence of the fact that the heating
function was symmetric? B) Would the generation of these oscillations occur if
we break symmetry? C) What is the spectrum of these oscillations? Is it
consistent with a 2nd spatial harmonic? The present work (and partly Tsiklauri

Namely, we investigate the physical nature of these oscillations in greater
detail: we study their spectrum (using periodogram technique) and how heat
positioning affects the mode excitation. We found that excitation of such
oscillations is practically independent of location of the heat deposition in
the loop. Because of the change of the background temperature and density, the
phase shift between the density and velocity perturbations is not exactly a
quarter of the period, it varies along the loop and is time dependent,

known to systematically overestimate the gas mass while their 13^CO emission is
usually very weak. At redshifts z>=1 the CI J=1-0 line shifts to much more
favorable atmospheric windows and can become a viable alternative tracer of the
H_2 gas fueling starburst events in the distant Universe.

population of high mass X-ray binaries and is essentially unobscured. It is
therefore a practically unbiased measure of star-formation in the host galaxies
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Using recent and archival observations of GRBs with
the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observatories, limits are placed on the
underlying X-ray emission from GRB hosts. Useful limits on the current massive
star-formation rates (SFRs), unaffected by obscuration, are obtained for the
hosts of three low redshift GRBs: GRB980425, GRB030329 and GRB031203. These
limits show that though the specific SFRs may be high (as in dwarf starburst
galaxies), none have massive obscured star-formation at the levels implied by
the sub-mm detection of some GRB hosts. It is also shown that in cases where
the faint luminosities of the late time afterglow or supernova emission are of
interest, the contribution of the host galaxy to the X-ray flux may be
significant.

unconnected, flux systems are forced to interact in response to the imposed
boundary driving by solving the non-ideal 3D MHD equations numerically. The
reconnection rate of the dynamical process is determined and compared with the
corresponding rate for the potential evolution of the magnetic field. This
shows that the dynamic reconnection rate is about a factor of two smaller than
the potential (perfect, instantaneous) rate for realistic solar driving
velocities demonstrating that this three-dimensional magnetic reconnection
process is fast.
  The energy input for a fixed advection distance is found to be independent of
the driving velocity. The Joule dissipation associated with the reconnection
process is also found to be basically dependent on the advection distance
rather than driving velocity. This implies that the timescale for the event
determines the effect the heating has on the temperature increase.
  Finally, the numerical experiments indicate that the observational structure
of the reconnection site changes dramatically depending on the phase of the
evolution of the passage of the two flux sources. In the initial phase, where
the sources become connected, the heating is confined to a compact region. For
the disconnecting phase the energy gets distributed over a larger area due to
the reconnected field line connectivity.

investigate the extent to which these properties can be generated from

the dynamical consequences of feedback.
  We find that, for a wide range of initial conditions, one impulsive mass loss
event will naturally produce a surface brightness profile in the remaining
stellar component of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) which is well fit over
many scale lengths by an exponential, in good qualitative agreement with
observations of Local Group dSphs. Furthermore, two impulsive mass loss phases,
punctuated by significant gas re-accretion, are found to be sufficient to
transform a central density cusp in the dark matter profile into a
near-constant density core. This may then provide the missing link between
current cosmological simulations, which predict a central cusp in the dark
matter density profile, and current observations, which find much shallower
central density profiles.
  We also look at the angular momentum history of dSphs and demonstrate that if
these galaxies have spent most of their lifetime in tidal isolation from
massive galaxies then they cannot have formed from high angular momentum gas

We find that when the system is subjected to constant displacement after
introduction of a seed crack, the crack does not propagate. This was found to
be true both for the modified Lennard-Jones potential of Falk and a
shorter-range potential of our own devising. Crystalline samples prepared with
these potentials exhibit normal brittle fracture, with running cracks. Only
when subjected to a constantly increasing strain did the crack in the glasses
lengthen. Even here, once the strain stopped increasing, the crack tip stopped
moving. We examined the stress-strain curve for our model materials, and found
that they did not exhibit the saturated stress plateau characteristic of
ductile materials. We attribute the failure of crack propagation in this system
to the availability of many meta-stable configurations available to the crack
tip which serve to soak up the energy which would otherwise drive the crack. We
conclude that this class of models is inadequate to describe crack propagation
in brittle glasses.

Real data were gathered from the 32 editions of the Brazilian soccer
championship, in a total of $13,411$ soccer players and 127 clubs. We find a
lot of interesting and perhaps unsuspected results. The probability that a
Brazilian soccer player has worked at $N$ clubs or played $M$ games shows an
exponential decay while the probability that he has scored $G$ goals is power
law. Now, if two soccer players who have worked at the same club at the same

exclusively by soccer players nodes). Our analysis shows that for this network
the degree distribution decays exponentially. We determine the exact values of

solving its discrete counterpart with analytical or numerical tools. As an

coincides with the onset of dilatation in the packing. We map this transition

intensity gradients in regions of high intensity, they average poorly over
fluctuating bumps and valleys on the mirror surfaces, caused by random thermal
fluctuations (thermoelastic noise). Flat-topped light beams (mesa beams) are
being considered as an alternative because they average over the thermoelastic
fluctuations much more effectively. However, the proposed mesa beams are
supported by nearly flat mirrors, which experience a very serious tilt
instability. In this paper we propose an alternative configuration in which
mesa-shaped beams are supported by nearly concentric spheres, which experience
only a weak tilt instability. The tilt instability is analyzed for these
mirrors in a companion paper by Savov and Vyatchanin. We also propose a
one-parameter family of light beams and mirrors in which, as the parameter
alpha varies continuously from 0 to pi, the beams and supporting mirrors get
deformed continuously from the nearly flat-mirrored mesa configuration (""FM"")
at alpha=0, to the nearly concentric-mirrored mesa configuration (""CM"") at

unstable, and as alpha moves away from 0 or pi, the optical stability improves.

the standard action for gravitons in linear theory and iterating repeatedly.

couples to the lowest order. We show that the second rank tensor

one proportional to the number of collisions, $N_{part}^{4/3}$. In order to get

as to recent position-space proposals), maximum signal velocity is position
(and observer) independent scale in our formulation by construction. The
formulation admits one more invariant scale identified with radius of
three-dimensional space-like hypersection of space-time. We present and discuss
the Lagrangian action for geodesic motion of a particle on the DSR space. For
the present formulation, one needs to distinguish the canonical (conjugated to
$x^\mu$) momentum $p^\mu$ from the conserved energy-momentum. Deformed Lorentz
transformations for $x^\mu$ induce complicated transformation law in space of
canonical momentum. $p^\mu$ is not a conserved quantity and obeys to deformed
dispersion relation. The conserved energy-momentum $P^\mu$ turns out to be
different from the canonical one, in particular, $P^\mu$-space is equipped with
nontrivial commutator. The nonlinear transformations for $x^\mu$ induce the
standard Lorentz transformations in space of $P^\mu$. It means, in particular,
that composite rule for $P^\mu$ is ordinary sum. There is no problem of total
momentum in the theory. $P^\mu$ obeys the standard energy-momentum relation
(while has nonstandard dependence on velocity).

We also construct a family of two-component links for which the complements
contain closed embedded totally geodesic surfaces of arbitrarily large genera.

that a characteristic u-shaped probability distribution is obtained for the

intermittency may be obtained in human heart rate variability data. The heart
and its regulatory systems are presumed to be both noisy and nonstationary.
Although the effect of additive noise on the laminar phase distribution in type
I intermittency is well known, neither the effect of multiplicative noise nor
of nonstationarity (i.e. changes of the control parameter with the time) have
been studied. In this paper, we first discuss the properties of two classes of
models of type I intermittency: a) the control parameter of the logistic map is
changed dichotomously from a value within the intermittency range to just below
the bifurcation point and back; b) the control parameter is changed randomly
within the same parameter range as in the model class a). We show that the
properties of both models are importantly different from those obtained for
type I intermittency in the presence additive noise as obtained by Hirsch
twenty years ago. The two models help explain some of the features seen in the
intermittency in human heart rate variability.

direct numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations and
of an advection-diffusion equation to study the transport of a passive tracer
by the spiral defect chaos state of a convecting fluid. The simulations show
that the transport is diffusive and is enhanced by the spatiotemporal chaos.
The enhancement in tracer diffusivity follows two regimes. For large Peclet
numbers (that is, small molecular diffusivities of the tracer), we find that
the enhancement is proportional to the Peclet number. For small Peclet numbers,
the enhancement is proportional to the square root of the Peclet number. We
explain the presence of these two regimes in terms of how the local transport
depends on the local wave numbers of the convection rolls. For large Peclet
numbers, we further find that defects cause the tracer diffusivity to be
enhanced locally in the direction orthogonal to the local wave vector but
suppressed in the direction of the local wave vector.

the quantity $L$ which is directly related to the slope of the symmetry energy

that the ME with the 3D E and B are not covariant upon the LT but upon the ST.
