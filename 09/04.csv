the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). For the Sgr dSph stars with
[Fe/H]>-1 the abundances are highly unusual, showing a striking enhancement in
heavy s-process elements, increasing with [Fe/H], deficiencies of the alpha-
elements (O, Si, Ca, and Ti), deficiencies of Al and Na, and deficiencies of
the iron-peak elements Mn and Cu. Our abundances suggest that the composition
of the metal-rich Sgr dSph stars is dominated by the ejecta of an old,
metal-poor population, including products of AGB stars and type Ia supernovae
(SN). We suggest two scenarios to explain the observations: Prolonged chemical
evolution in a galaxy experiencing significant mass-loss, and chemical
enrichment in a system with a large burst of star-formation, followed by a
quiescent period of many Gry. The Galactic globular cluster Omega Cen, and the
Fornax dwarf galaxy show similar abundance patterns, which suggests that those
systems evolved similar to the Sgr dSph.

important constraint for models of chemical evolution and Galaxy formation. In
this study we derive radial gradients of C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, as well as S,
from abundance determinations in young OB stars. Our database is composed of a
sample of 69 members of 25 open clusters, OB associations and H II regions with
Galactocentric distances between 4.7 and 13.2 kpc. An important feature of this
abundance database is the fact that the abundances were derived
self-consistently in non-LTE using a homogeneous set of stellar parameters.
Such an uniform analysis is expected to reduce the magnitude of random errors,
as well as the influence of systematics in the gradients defined by the
abundance and Galactocentric distance. The metallicity gradients obtained in
this study are, in general, flatter than the results from previous recent
abundance studies of early-type stars. The slopes are found to be between
-0.031 (for oxygen) and $-0.052 dex kpc^{-1}$ (for magnesium). The gradients
obtained for the studied elements are quite similar and if averaged, they can
be represented by a single slope of $-0.042 \pm 0.007 dex kpc^{-1}$. This value
is generally consistent with an overall flattening of the radial gradients with
time.

We have investigated the nature of the very flat observed X-ray spectrum.
Chandra grating data show the presence of X-ray absorption lines, revealing two
distinct components of the absorbing gas, one which is consistent with our
previous model of the UV/X-ray absorber while the other, which is outflowing at
a velocity of ~1100 km/s has a larger column density and is much more highly
ionized. The broad-band spectral characteristics of the X-ray continuum
observed with XMM during 2001 April, reveal the presence of a third layer of
absorption consisting of a very large column (~2.5 x 10E23 cm^-2) of highly
ionized gas with a covering fraction ~50%. This low covering fraction suggests
that the absorber lies within a few lt-days of the X-ray source and/or is
filamentary in structure. Interestingly, these absorbers are not in thermal
equilibrium with one another. The two new components are too highly ionized to
be radiatively accelerated, which we suggest is evidence for a hydromagnetic
origin for the outflow. Applying our model to the Nov dataset, we can account
for the spectral variability primarily by a drop in the ionization states of
the absorbers, as expected by the change in the continuum flux. When this
complex absorption is accounted for we find the underlying continuum to be
typical of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The spectral curvature attributed to the high
column absorber, in turn, reduces estimates of the flux and extent of any broad

constraints on different models for explaining the overall emission from
accreting black holes. The overall spectral energy distribution is consistent
with synchrotron origin for the optical and infrared emission, however, the
X-ray flux is above the power-law continuation of the optical and infrared

velocity distributions of many large HI and H2 clouds within half a kiloparsec.
The present rim coincides with most of the nearby OB associations, but their
mean velocity does not seem to be related to the Belt expansion. The Belt age
is uncertain by a factor of 2 because of the discrepancy found between the
dynamical timescale (20 to 30 Myr) and the stellar ages (30 to 60 Myr). The
stellar content is derived from kinematic studies for massive stars and from
X-ray observations for young solar-mass ones. Whether star formation is active
along the rim or spread over a larger fraction of the disc is debated. The Belt
flatness and its tilt remain very difficult to interpret. Various scenarii
involve the impact of a high-velocity cloud, a cascade of supernovae, the
dissolution of a rotating system, or the braking of a supercloud entering the
spiral arm. Because of the enhanced star formation, the Belt supernova rate
over the past few million years has been 3 to 4 times larger than the local
Galactic rate. The corresponding pulsars may be responsible for the population
of unknown gamma-ray sources associated with the Belt. The higher rate also

exposing sensitive information to potential attackers. We believe this
reluctance remains high because current anonymization techniques are weak and
one-size-fits-all--or better put, one size tries to fit all. We must develop
standards and make anonymization available at varying levels, striking a
balance between privacy and utility. Organizations have different needs and
trust other organizations to different degrees. They must be able to map
multiple anonymization levels with defined risks to the trust levels they share
with (would-be) receivers. It is not until there are industry standards for
multiple levels of anonymization that we will be able to move forward and

In the first
method, we take the Borel mass M2 to infinity. Here, the sum rules become very
sensitive to the chosen threshold s0. We fix the threshold by setting the
daughter sum rule equal to the meson mass in this limit. The second method
introduces a Borel mass dependent threshold s0(M2). We choose functions s0(M2)
such that the corresponding sum rule is not dependent on the Borel mass
anymore. The relevant hadronic parameter is extracted at the most stable
function s0(M2). The two methods differ in the notion of quark-hadron duality.
Whereas the first method emphasizes errors coming from the simple duality
ansatz, the second method is constructed such as to extract hadronic properties
from the region where the duality approximation is fulfilled best. We use these
modifications of the sum rule approach to extract values for the B-meson decay
constant, the semi-leptonic form factor f+ at zero momentum transfer and the

of the Skyrme model on the three-sphere of radius L is carried out. It turns
out that only solutions that in the limit of infinite L tend to skyrmions
(localized at the poles) are linearly stable. The other solutions are unstable
and, for a given solution, the number of instabilities, for L sufficiently
large, is equal to the index of a harmonic map to which this solution tends
pointwise in the limit of infinite L. Solutions which tends pointwise to
harmonic maps and which in addition have a definite parity, undergo a
transition by +1 in the number of instabilities as L grows. Due to the
instability, new solutions, with spontaneously broken reflection symmetry,
appeare by bifurcations. In the case of the 1-skyrmion this critical phenomenon
can be fully described analytically. As a result, in some neighbourhood of
critical radius at which 1-skyrmion bifurcates from the identity solution, one
gets unique series expansions for the profile of the 1-skyrmion and for its
energy, though the series coefficients, due to nonlinearity, are not known in
general form. To the author's best knowledge the series were not given in
literature so far. A similar mechanism of spontaneous breaking of parity is
also observed when other solutions appear by bifurcations from symmetric
solutions.

In addition, we point out the difference of profiles directly, i.e., although
the surface profiles of both models and the growth path of the BDP model are

Lagrangian mechanics provides a level of description of phenomena which has
been largely ignored by philosophers, since it falls between their accustomed
levels--``laws of nature'' and ``models''. Another main moral concerns
ontology: the ontology of Lagrangian mechanics is both more subtle and more
problematic than philosophers often realize.
  The treatment of Lagrangian mechanics provides an introduction to the subject
for philosophers, and is technically elementary. In particular, it is confined
to systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, and for the most part
eschews modern geometry. But it includes a presentation of Routhian reduction
and of Noether's ``first theorem''.

Specifically, we look for a smooth time-dependent Hamiltonian whose unique
ground state slowly changes from the initial state of the circuit to its final
state. Since this construction requires in general an n-local Hamiltonian, we
will study whether approximation is possible using previous results on ground
state entanglement and perturbation theory. Finally we will point out how the
adiabatic model can be relaxed in various ways to allow for 2-local partially
adiabatic algorithms as well as 2-local holonomic quantum algorithms.
