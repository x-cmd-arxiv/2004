to be blueshifted with respect to the lower ionization lines, such as H beta,
and often show a strong blue excess asymmetry not seen in the low ionization
lines. There is accumulating evidence that the H beta profile is dominated by
gravity, and thus provides a useful estimate of the black hole mass in AGN. The
shift and asymmetry commonly seen in C IV suggest that non gravitational
effects, such as obscuration and radiation pressure, may affect the line
profile. We explore the relation between the H beta and C IV profiles using UV
spectra available for 81 of the 87 z < 0.5 PG quasars in the Boroson & Green
(BG92) sample. We find the following: (1) Narrow C IV lines (FWHM < 2000 km/s)
are rare (~2 per cent occurrence rate) compared to narrow H beta lines (~20 per
cent). (2) In most objects where the H beta FWHM <4000 km/s the C IV line is
broader than H beta, but the reverse is true when the H beta FWHM > 4000 km/s.
This argues against the view that C IV generally originates closer to the
center, compared to H beta.
  (3) C IV appears to provide a significantly less accurate, and possibly
biased estimate of the black hole mass in AGN, compared with H beta. (4) All
objects where C IV is strongly blueshifted and asymmetric have a high L/L_Edd,
but the reverse is not true. This suggests that a high L/L_Edd is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for generating a blueshifted asymmetric C IV
emission. (5) We also find indications for dust reddening and scattering in
`normal' AGN. In particular, PG quasars with a redder optical-UV continuum
slope show weaker C IV emission, stronger C IV absorption, and a higher optical
continuum polarization.

period satisfies all of the spectroscopy since at least 1982, including
extensive new observations during 2003 and 2004, and it has predicted the next
transition during September--October 2004. Measurements of the H alpha
equivalent width reveal a sharp emission peak in the phase diagram, in contrast
to the apparently sinusoidal light curve. The He II absorption-line strength is
essentially constant, while He I varies strongly, possibly filled in by
emission in the O6 state, thus producing the apparent spectral-type variations.
The O8 state appears to be the ""normal"" one. Two intermediate O7 observations
have been obtained, which fall at the expected phases, but these are the only
modern observations of the transitions so far. The period is too long for
rotation or pulsation; although there is no direct evidence as yet for a
companion, a model in which tidally induced oscillations drive an enhanced wind
near periastron of an eccentric orbit appears promising. Further observations
during the now predictable transitions may provide a critical test. Ultraviolet
and X-ray observations during both states will likely also prove illuminating.

dark matter subhaloes. The masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion are
obtained from a standard merger tree. During the subsequent evolution, the
subhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical
friction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these
effects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass loss
rate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. This
allows us to write the average mass loss rate as a simple function that depends
only on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent
halo. After calibrating the model by matching the subhalo mass function (SHMF)
of cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from numerical simulations, we
investigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the SHMF.We find
that, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal.
Instead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent
halo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a
halo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thus
allowing less time for mass loss to operate. We analyze the halo-to-halo
scatter, and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes depends
most strongly on their accretion history in the last Gyr. Finally we provide a
simple fitting function for the average SHMF of a parent halo of any mass at
any redshift and for any cosmology, and briefly discuss several implications of
our findings.

takes into account the important air shower characteristics such as the lateral
and longitudinal particle distributions, the particle track length and energy
distributions, a realistic magnetic field geometry and the shower evolution as
a whole. The Monte Carlo approach allows us to retain the full polarisation
information and to carry out the calculations without the need for any
far-field approximations. We demonstrate the strategies developed to tackle the
computational effort associated with the simulation of a huge number of
particles for a great number of observer bins and illustrate the robustness and
accuracy of these techniques. We predict the emission pattern, the radial and
the spectral dependence of the radiation from a prototypical 10^17 eV vertical
air shower and find good agreement with our analytical results (Huege & Falcke
2003) and the available historical data. Track-length effects in combination
with magnetic field effects surprisingly wash out any significant asymmetry in
the total field strength emission pattern in spite of the magnetic field
geometry. While statistics of total field strengths alone can therefore not
prove the geomagnetic origin, the predicted high degree of polarisation in the
direction perpendicular to the shower and magnetic field axes allows a direct
test of the geomagnetic emission mechanism with polarisation-sensitive
experiments such as LOPES. Our code provides a robust, yet flexible basis for
detailed studies of the dependence of the radio emission on specific shower
parameters and for the inclusion of additional radiation mechanism in the
future.

molecule experiments, we study a simple model for a motor moving along a

motion. The motors also have finite processivity, i.e., they can leave the
track with a position dependent rate. We show that the response of the system
to disorder in the hopping off rate depends on the value of the external force.
For most values of the external force, strong disorder causes the motors which
survive for long times on the track to be localized at preferred positions.
However, near the stall force, localization occurs for any amount of disorder.
Existence of localized states near the top of the band implies a stretched
exponential contribution to the decay of the survival probability. To obtain
these results, we study the complex eigenvalue spectrum of the time evolution
operator. A similar spectral analysis also provides a very efficient method for
studying the dynamics of motors with infinite processivity.

B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.70.174511",,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  According to a generic temperature vs. carrier-doping (T-p) phase diagram of
high-temperature superconductors it has been proposed that as doping increases
to the overdoped region they approach gradually a conventional (canonical)
Fermi Liquid. However, Hall effect measurements in several systems reported by
different authors show a still strong \emph{T}-dependence in overdoped samples.
We report here electrical transport measurements of
Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-delta} thin films presenting a temperature
dependence of the Hall constant, R_H, which does not present a gradual
transition towards the T-independent behavior of a canonical Fermi Liquid.
Instead, the T-dependence passes by a minimum near optimal doping and then
increases again in the overdoped region. We discuss the theoretical predictions
from two representative Fermi Liquid models and show that they can not give a
satisfactory explanation to our data. We conclude that this region of the phase
diagram in YBCO, as in most HTSC, is not a canonical Fermi Liquid, therefore we
call it Anomalous Fermi Liquid.

  Awareness","16 pages, 1 table and 3 figures. Experimental results are added",,,,"cs.DM cs.DC cs.DS",,"  In order to investigate the routing aspects of small-world networks,
Kleinberg proposes a network model based on a $d$-dimensional lattice with
long-range links chosen at random according to the $d$-harmonic distribution.
Kleinberg shows that the greedy routing algorithm by using only local
information performs in $O(\log^2 n)$ expected number of hops, where $n$
denotes the number of nodes in the network. Martel and Nguyen have found that
the expected diameter of Kleinberg's small-world networks is $\Theta(\log n)$.
Thus a question arises naturally: Can we improve the routing algorithms to
match the diameter of the networks while keeping the amount of information
stored on each node as small as possible? We extend Kleinberg's model and add
three augmented local links for each node: two of which are connected to nodes
chosen randomly and uniformly within $\log^2 n$ Mahattan distance, and the
third one is connected to a node chosen randomly and uniformly within $\log n$
Mahattan distance. We show that if each node is aware of $O(\log n)$ number of
neighbors via the augmented local links, there exist both non-oblivious and
oblivious algorithms that can route messages between any pair of nodes in
$O(\log n \log \log n)$ expected number of hops, which is a near optimal
routing complexity and outperforms the other related results for routing in
Kleinberg's small-world networks. Our schemes keep only $O(\log^2 n)$ bits of
routing information on each node, thus they are scalable with the network size.
Besides adding new light to the studies of social networks, our results may
also find applications in the design of large-scale distributed networks, such
as peer-to-peer systems, in the same spirit of Symphony.

recent few years a very active research area due to the important impact it has
in several relevant application areas. One interesting task thereof is that of
singling out anomalous individuals from a given population, e.g., to detect
rare events in time-series analysis settings, or to identify objects whose
behavior is deviant w.r.t. a codified standard set of ""social"" rules. Such
exceptional individuals are usually referred to as outliers in the literature.
  Recently, outlier detection has also emerged as a relevant KR&R problem. In
this paper, we formally state the concept of outliers by generalizing in
several respects an approach recently proposed in the context of default logic,
for instance, by having outliers not being restricted to single individuals
but, rather, in the more general case, to correspond to entire (sub)theories.
We do that within the context of logic programming and, mainly through
examples, we discuss its potential practical impact in applications. The
formalization we propose is a novel one and helps in shedding some light on the
real nature of outliers. Moreover, as a major contribution of this work, we
illustrate the exploitation of minimality criteria in outlier detection. The
computational complexity of outlier detection problems arising in this novel
setting is thoroughly investigated and accounted for in the paper as well.
Finally, we also propose a rewriting algorithm that transforms any outlier
detection problem into an equivalent inference problem under the stable model
semantics, thereby making outlier computation effective and realizable on top
of any stable model solver.

of mass, for the graviton, appears as an effective extra contribution to the
stress-energy tensor. We obtain for such kind of theory that the extra states
of polarization have amplitude several orders of magnitude smaller than the
polarizations purely general relativity (GR), h_(+) and h_(x), in the
VIRGO-LIGO frequency band. This result appears using the best limit to the
graviton mass inferred from solar system observations and if we consider that
all the components of the metric perturbation have the same amplitude h.
However, if we consider low frequency gravitational waves (e.g., f_(GW) ~
10^(-7) Hz), the extra polarization states produce similar Newman-Penrose
amplitudes that the polarization states purely GR. This particular
characteristic of the bimetric theory studied here could be used, for example,
to directly impose limits on the mass of the graviton from future experiments
that study the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

the Z2 orbifold fixed points, and 1 family propagates in the 5d bulk -- and
identify them as the first-two and third families. Remarkably, the first two
families enjoy a non-abelian dihedral D4 family symmetry, due to the geometric
setup of the compactified space. In all our models there are always some color
triplets, i.e. (6,1,1) representations of the Pati-Salam group, survive

Pati-Salam symmetry to that of the Standard Model. One model, with a 5d E6
symmetry, may give rise to interesting low energy phenomenology. We study gauge

relation at the 5d compactification scale, and is capable of generating
reasonable quark/lepton masses and mixings. Potential problems are also

of this preprint is to show that axiomatic methods are also very efficient for
computer science. It is possible to apply these methods to many problems in
computer science. Here the main modes of computer functioning and program
execution are described, formalized, and studied in an axiomatic context. The
emphasis is on three principal modes: computation, decision, and acceptation.
Now the prevalent mode for computers is computation. Problems of artificial
intelligence involve decision mode, while communication functions of computer
demand accepting mode. The main goal of this preprint is to study properties of
these modes and relations between them. These problems are closely related to
such fundamental concepts of computer science and technology as computability,
decidability, and acceptability. In other words, we are concerned with the
question what computers and software systems can do working in this or that
mode. Consequently, results of this preprint allow one to achieve higher
understanding of computations and in such a way, to find some basic properties
of computers and their applications. Classes of algorithms, which model
different kinds of computers and software, are compared with respect to their
computing, accepting or deciding power. Operations with algorithms and machines
are introduced. Examples show how to apply axiomatic results to different
classes of algorithms and machines in order to enhance their performance.

Lagrangian distributions, appear naturally in Differential Geometry, Calculus
of Variations and Rational Mechanics. The basic differential invariants of a
dynamical Lagrangian distribution w.r.t. the action of the group of
symplectomorphisms of the ambient symplectic manifold are the curvature
operator and the curvature form. These invariants can be seen as
generalizations of the classical curvature tensor in Riemannian Geometry. In
particular, in terms of these invariants one can localize the focal points
along extremals of the corresponding variational problems. In the present paper
we study the behavior of the curvature operator, the curvature form and the
focal points of a dynamical Lagrangian distribution after its reduction by
arbitrary first integrals in involution. The interesting phenomenon is that the
curvature form of so-called monotone increasing Lagrangian dynamical
distributions, which appear naturally in mechanical systems, does not decrease
after reduction. It also turns out that the set of focal points to the given
point w.r.t. the monotone increasing dynamical Lagrangian distribution and the
corresponding set of focal points w.r.t. its reduction by one integral are
alternating sets on the corresponding integral curve of the Hamiltonian system
of the considered dynamical distributions. Moreover, the first focal point
corresponding to the reduced Lagrangian distribution comes before any focal
point related to the original dynamical distribution. We illustrate our results
on the classical $N$-body problem.

that embodies the typical finite size content of the problem. The integrated
decay widths of muon atoms calculated with this shell model are then compared

both models exactly the same theoretical ingredients and parameters. We find

Langevin equation derived for the first cavity alone. This is done for an input

nonclassical state in the source cavity. The analogous electro-optic scheme
using heterodyne detection introduces extra noise which prevents the production
