detected radio spectral lines of various carbon-chain molecules such as CCS,
C$_{3}$S, C$_{4}$H, HC$_{3}$N, and HC$_{5}$N. On the other hand, the NH$_{3}$
lines are weak and the N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ lines are not detected. According to our

in L1495B and L1521B are compact with the radius of 0.063 and 0.044 pc,
respectively, and have a simple elliptical structure. The distributions of CCS
seem to be different from those of well-studied starless cores, L1498 and

H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, HN$^{13}$C, and C$^{34}$S lines are detected in L1495B and
L1521B, the densities of these cores are high enough to excite the NH$_{3}$ and
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ lines. Therefore, the abundances of NH$_{3}$ and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$
relative to carbon-chain molecules are apparently deficient, as observed in
L1521E. We found that longer carbon-chain molecules such as HC$_{5}$N and
C$_{4}$H are more abundant in TMC-1 than L1495B and L1521B, while those of
sulfur-bearing molecules such as C$^{34}$S, CCS, and C$_{3}$S are comparable.
Both distributions and abundances of the observed molecules of L1495B and

investigate the nature of the dust heating sources in this spectral domain. The
analysis is carried out using a sample of 123 normal, late-type, nearby
galaxies with available data at several frequencies. The mid-IR luminosity
(normalized to the H-band luminosity) correlates better with the far-IR
luminosity than with more direct tracers of the young stellar population such
as the H$\alpha$ and the UV luminosity. The comparison of resolved images
reveals a remarkable similarity in the H$\alpha$ and mid-IR morphologies, with
prominent HII regions at both frequencies. The mid-IR images, however, show in
addition a diffuse emission not associated with HII regions nor with the
diffuse H$\alpha$ emission. This evidence indicates that the stellar population
responsible for the heating of dust emitting in the mid-IR is similar to that
heating big grains emitting in the far-IR, including relatively evolved stars
responsible for the non-ionizing radiation. The scatter in the mid-IR vs.
H$\alpha$, UV and far-IR luminosity relation is mostly due to metallicity
effects, with metal-poor objects having a lower mid-IR emission per unit star
formation rate than metal-rich galaxies. Our analysis indicates that the mid-IR
luminosity is not an optimal star formation tracer in normal, late-type
galaxies.

spectral characteristic of WN stars. Broad CIV5808 emission, termed the red
bump, is detected in 9 galaxies and CIII5996 is detected in 6 galaxies. These
emission features are due to WC stars. We derive the numbers of late WN and
early WC stars from the luminosity of the blue and red bumps, respectively. The
number of O stars is estimated from the luminosity of the Hbeta emission line,

stars, N_WR/N_O, increases with metallicity. For low metallicity galaxies, the
results agree with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models for galaxies
with a burst of star formation, and indicates an IMF slope -2 < Gamma < -2.35

suggest a Salpeter IMF (Gamma = -2.35) and an extended short burst. The main
possible sources of error are the adopted luminosities for single WCE and WNL

places to look for the remnants of ancient dwarf satellites. The classical
Searle & Zinn (1978) scenario of the formation of the Milky Way, in which the
halo globular clusters formed in larger dwarf galaxies, can nowadays be
considered the local manifestation of the hierarchical galaxy formation. It is
now well known that some Galactic globular clusters are actually associated
with the tidal stellar stream resulting from the accretion of dwarf satellites,
thereby confirming that this process plays an important role in the building of
the Milky Way globular cluster system. Furthermore, several recent studies have
suggested that the two most luminous Galactic globular clusters (M54,
associated with Sagittarius and Omega Centauri) might be the nuclei of dwarf
galaxies. Extending previous suggestions, van den Bergh (2000) has argued that
the ``young'' globulars located in the outer halo might be the nuclei of
extinct dwarf galaxies and suggests that a search for evidence of this may
prove worthwhile. If these clusters formed within larger stellar systems, we
would expect to find them surrounded by a stellar population that should be
revealed by deep photometry over a wide field. In this paper, we present the
first (most interesting) preliminary results from a long term project designed
to search for tidal debris around remote halo globular clusters, debris that
may be the vestiges of the larger systems in which these clusters formed.

upper limits on the presence of wide absorption bands corresponding to

to belong to the cluster. Based on this sample, the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the cluster is approximately 680 +- 140 km/s. We have performed
stellar population synthesis in the cluster members as well as in the field
galaxies of the sample and found that there are population gradients in the
cluster with central galaxies hosting mainly intermediate/old populations
whereas galaxies in the cluster outskirts show clearly an increase of younger
populations, meaning that star formation is predominantly taking place in the
outer regions of the cluster. In a general way, field galaxies seem to host
less evolved stellar populations than cluster members. In fact, in terms of
ages, young supergiant stars dominate the spectra of field galaxies whereas
cluster galaxies display a dominant number of old and intermediate age stars.
Following the work of other authors (e.g. Dressler et al. 1999) we have
estimated the percentage of K+A galaxies in our sample and found around 13% in
the cluster and 10% in the field. These values were estimated through means of
a new method, based on stellar population synthesis results, that takes into
account all possible absorption features in the spectrum and thus makes optimal
use of the data.

these cores can be used to study the evolution of black holes throughout the

holes. We start by introducing some of the basic properties of compact radio
cores and how they scale with accretion power. The relative contribution of
jets and radio cores to the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is strongest in
sub-Eddington black holes but also present in the most luminous objects. Radio
and X-rays are correlated as a function of black hole mass such that the most
massive black holes are most suited for radio detections. We present a radio
core luminosity function for the present universe down to the least luminous
AGN. The SKA will essentially detect all dormant black holes in the local
universe, such as that in our Milky Way, out to several tens of Megaparsecs. It
will also be able to see black holes in the making at redshifts z>10 for black
hole masses larger than 10^7 M_sun. Finally, we suggest that the first
generation of black holes may have jets that are frustrated in their dense
environment and thus appear as Gigahertz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) sources. Since
their intrinsic size and peak frequency are related and angular size and
frequency scale differently with redshift, there is a unique region in
parameter space that should be occupied by emerging black holes in the epoch of
reionization. This can be well probed by radio-only methods with the SKA.

The distribution of recurrence times turns out to be invariant under such

is derived imposing only the self-similarity of the process, which also yields
a scaling relation between the Gutenberg-Richter b-value, the exponent

$A\equiv (A^+,A^-)$ and $B\equiv (B^+,B^-)$ are initially separated in space
and the ion-dynamics is described by reaction-diffusion equations obeying local
electroneutrality. Without an electric field, the reaction zone moves
diffusively leaving behind a constant concentration of $C$-s. In the presence
of an electric field which drives the reagents towards the reaction zone, we
find that the reaction zone still moves diffusively but with a diffusion
coefficient which slightly decreases with increasing field. The important
electric field effect is that the concentration of $C$-s is no longer constant
but increases linearly in the direction of the motion of the front. The case of
an electric field of reversed polarity is also discussed and it is found that
the motion of the front has a diffusive, as well as a drift component. The
concentration of $C$-s decreases in the direction of the motion of the front,
up to the complete extinction of the reaction. Possible applications of the
above results to the understanding of the formation of Liesegang patterns in an

standard GR. A coframe (a field of four independent 1-forms) is considered, in
this approach, to be a basic dynamical variable. The metric tensor is treated
as a secondary structure. The general Lagrangian, quadratic in the first order
derivatives of the coframe field is not unique. It involves three dimensionless
free parameters. We consider a weak field approximation of the general coframe
teleparallel model. In the linear approximation, the field variable, the
coframe, is covariantly reduced to the superposition of the symmetric and
antisymmetric field. We require this reduction to be preserved on the levels of
the Lagrangian, of the field equations and of the conserved currents. This
occurs if and only if the pure Yang - Mills type term is removed from the
Lagrangian. The absence of this term is known to be necessary and sufficient
for the existence of the viable (Schwarzschild) spherical-symmetric solution.
Moreover, the same condition guarantees the absence of ghosts and tachyons in
particle content of the theory. The condition above is shown recently to be
necessary for a well defined Hamiltonian formulation of the model. Here we
derive the same condition in the Lagrangian formulation by means of the weak
field reduction.

permits to realize that by no means the effects of Relativity can be simulated
taking into account the structure of the constituent particles, the two effects
being independent and necessary for a proper description of available high
energy data in terms of CQM.

d-skeleton of the simplex. We further show that it is equivalent to a ``Winding
Number Conjecture'' that concerns only maps of the (d-1)-skeleton of a
(q-1)(d+1)-simplex to \R^d. ``Many Tverberg partitions'' arise if and only if
there are ``many q-winding partitions.'' The d=2 case of the Winding Number

does not exist. Here we propose a novel method of data analysis that, based on
the space-time combined generalization of the correlation integral leads to a
self-consistent visualization and analysis of both spatial and temporal
correlations. When analyzing global seismicity we discovered a universal
relation linking the spatial Influence Length of a given earthquake to the time
elapsed from the event itself. Following an event, time correlations (i.e.
causality effects) exist in a region that shrinks over time, suggesting a
long-range dissipating stress transfer. A different process is acting in the
short-range where events are randomly set, evidencing a sub-diffusive growth of
the seismogenic zone.

of the theory of Markov processes leading to a phenomenological Fokker-Planck

derived. We discuss in detail the analysis and show that the estimated equation
can describe the statistics of the turbulent cascade. A remarkably result is
that the main differences between longitudinal and transverse increments can be
explained by a simple rescaling-symmetry, namely the cascade speed of the
transverse increments is 1.5 times faster than that of the longitudinal
increments. Small differences can be found in the skewness and in a higher
order intermittency term. The rescaling symmetry is compatible with the
Kolmogorov constants and the Karman equation and give new insight into the use
of extended self similarity (ESS) for transverse increments. Based on the
results we propose an extended self similarity for the transverse increments
(ESST).
