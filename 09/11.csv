effect in a supersymmetry-breaking brane-world. Supersymmetry is assumed to be
preserved in the bulk while broken on a 3-brane. Due to the boundary conditions
imposed on the compactified extra dimensions, there is an effective Casimir
energy induced on the brane. The net Casimir energy contributed from the
graviton and the gravitino modes as a result of supersymmetry-breaking on the
brane is identified as the observed dark energy, which in our construction is a
cosmological constant. We show that the smallness of the cosmological constant,
which results from the huge contrast in the extra-dimensional volumes between
that associated with the 3-brane and that of the bulk, is attainable under very
relaxed conditions.

derived as directly imposed by observations in conjunction with the results of

population of sources dominating the UV ionizing background at z<6 is the same

measurements of the mean LyA transmitted flux at high redshifts requires the
epoch of hydrogen reionization of the IGM to have occurred at a redshift z <
11, independent of the space density of the sources. The upper limit on the
reionization redshift depends only on the shape of the UV spectra of the

requires the sources of photoionization to have had hard spectra, such as QSOs
or Population III stars. The only way to escape these conclusions is either:
1.the sources which dominate the photoionization background at z<6 are the
remnants of a population that was a much more prodigious source of ionizing
photons at earlier times, or 2.the sources responsible for the photoionization
of the IGM are an unknown population that contributes negligibly to the

X-ray detected EROs available in the literature. X-ray spectral analysis of the

For the AGN EROs this is consistent, under reasonable assumptions, with the
relation established locally between the host galaxies and their central black
holes. This suggest that the majority of EROs are powered by massive black
holes accreting, on average, at about 0.03-0.1 of the Eddington limit.

responsible for the solar wind that have come from the past 8 years of SOHO
observations, analysis, and theoretical work. For example, the UVCS instrument
on SOHO has revealed the acceleration region of the fast solar wind to be far
from simple thermal equilibrium. Evidence for preferential acceleration of
ions, 100 million K ion temperatures, and marked departures from Maxwellian
velocity distributions all point to specific types of collisionless heating
processes. The slow solar wind, typically associated with bright helmet
streamers, has been found to share some of the nonthermal characteristics of
the fast wind. Abundance measurements from spectroscopy and visible-light
coronagraphic movies from LASCO have led to a better census of the plasma
components making up the slow wind. The origins of the solar wind in the
photosphere and chromosphere have been better elucidated with disk spectroscopy
from the SUMER and CDS instruments. Finally, the impact of the solar wind on
spacecraft systems, ground-based technology, and astronauts has been greatly
aided by having continuous solar observations at the Earth-Sun L1 point, and
SOHO has set a strong precedent for future studies of space weather.

worst-case errors in the fitted radius are evaluated by restricting ourselves
to the case of light emitted and received in the equatorial plane of a
rapidly-rotating neutron star. First, using an approximate flux which is
adapted to the one-dimensional nature of such an emission region, we show how
pulse shapes can be constructed using an exact spacetime metric and fully
accounting for time-delay effects. We compare this to a method which
approximates the exterior spacetime of the star by the Schwarzschild metric,
inserts special relativistic effects by hand, and neglects time-delay effects.
By comparing these methods, we show that there are significant differences in
these methods for some applications, for example pulse timing and constraining
the stellar radius. In the case of constraining the stellar radius, we show
that fitting the approximate pulse shapes to the full calculation yields errors
in the fitted radius of as much as about +/- 10%, depending on the rotation
rate and size of the star as well as the details describing the emitting
region. However, not all applications of pulse shape calculations suffer from
significant errors: we also show that the calculation of the soft-hard phase
lag for a 1 keV blackbody does not strongly depend on the method used for
calculating the pulse shapes.

drag, which generates radial drift and triggers unstable modes. The secular
instability does not require self-gravity, yet it generates growing particle
density perturbations that could seed planetesimal formation. Growth rates are
slower than dynamical, but faster than radial drift, timescales. Growth rates,
like streaming velocities, are maximized for marginal coupling (stopping times
comparable dynamical times). Fastest growth occurs when the solid to gas
density ratio is order unity and feedback is strongest. Curiously, growth is
strongly suppressed when the densities are too nearly equal. The relation
between background drift and wave properties is explained by analogy with
Howard's semicircle theorem. The three-dimensional, two-fluid equations
describe a sixth order (in the complex frequency) dispersion relation. A
terminal velocity approximation allows simplification to an approximate cubic
dispersion relation. To describe the simplest manifestation of this

the formula La0.7-xLnxCa0.3CoO3 with Ln = Pr, Nd, Gd and Dy have been
investigated. Compositions close to x = 0.0 contain large ferromagnetic
clusters or domains, and show Brillouin-like behaviour of the field-cooled DC
magnetization data with fairly high ferromagnetic Tc values, besides low
electrical resistivities with near-zero temperature coefficients. The
zero-field-cooled data generally show a non-monotonic behaviour with a peak at
a temperatures slightly lower than Tc. The near x = 0.0 compositions show a
prominent peak corresponding to the Tc in the AC-susceptibility data. The
ferromagnetic Tc varies linearly with x or the average radius of the A-site
cations, (rA). With increase in x or decrease in (rA), the magnetization value
at any given temperature decreases markedly and the AC-susceptibility
measurements show a prominent transition arising from small magnetic clusters
with some characteristics of a spin-glass. Electrical resistivity increases
with increase in x, showed a significant increase around a critical value of x
or (rA), at which composition the small clusters also begin to dominate. These
properties can be understood in terms of a phase separation scenario wherein
large magnetic clusters give way to smaller ones with increase in x, with both
types of clusters being present in certain compositions. The changes in
magnetic and electrical properties occur parallely since the large
ferromagnetic clusters are hole-rich and the small clusters are hole-poor.
Variable-range hopping seems to occur at low temperatures in these cobaltates.

flat solutions, thus losing the information about the global geometry of the

indistinguishable in different scenarios. We argue that important differences

not hold, and that g_{\rho H H} is not independent of the hadron H. However, we
prove that, in any model within the AdS/QCD context, there are two limiting
regimes where the g_{\rho H H}, along with the couplings of all excited vector
mesons as well, become H-independent: (1) when H is created by an operator of
large dimension, and (2) when H is a highly-excited hadron. We also find a
sector of a particular model where universality for the rho coupling is exact.
Still, in none of these cases need it be true that f_\rho g_\rho=m_\rho^2,

factor of order two) within the models we have studied.

a randomly chosen set of frequencies $\Omega$ of mean size $\tau N$. Is it
possible to reconstruct $f$ from the partial knowledge of its Fourier
coefficients on the set $\Omega$?
  A typical result of this paper is as follows: for each $M > 0$, suppose that
$f$ obeys $$ # \{t, f(t) \neq 0 \} \le \alpha(M) \cdot (\log N)^{-1} \cdot #
\Omega, $$ then with probability at least $1-O(N^{-M})$, $f$ can be
reconstructed exactly as the solution to the $\ell_1$ minimization problem $$
\min_g \sum_{t = 0}^{N-1} |g(t)|, \quad \text{s.t.} \hat g(\omega) = \hat
f(\omega) \text{for all} \omega \in \Omega. $$ In short, exact recovery may be
obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for
$\alpha$ which depends on the desired probability of success; except for the
logarithmic factor, the condition on the size of the support is sharp.
  The methodology extends to a variety of other setups and higher dimensions.
For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one or
two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples--provided that the
number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above--by minimizing
other convex functionals such as the total-variation of $f$.

contribution is that we unfold the result in a new model which is well adapted
to quantum protocols. We also simplify some aspects of the classical case. In
particular, the case of protocols with an arbitrary number of layers of
sub-protocols is naturally covered in the proposed model.

  Physics, ""Open Systems and Quantum Information,"" Torun, Poland, June 9-12,
  2004. To be published in Open Systems and Information Dynamics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A noisy Gaussian channel is defined as a channel in which an input field mode
is subjected to random Gaussian displacements in phase space. We introduce the
quantum fidelity of a Gaussian channel for pure and mixed input states, and we
derive a universal scaling law of the fidelity for pure initial states. We also
find the maximum fidelity of a Gaussian channel over all input states. Quantum
cloning and continuous-variable teleportation are presented as physical
examples of Gaussian channels to which the fidelity results can be applied.

"quant-ph/0409064","Yair Goldin","Yair Goldin","Theoretical Value of the Electromagnetic Coupling Constant","8 pages, 1 eps figure. RevTeX 4",,,,"quant-ph",,"  An insight into bispinor analysis makes it possible to describe the electron
in selfaction as a fundamental steady state. The electromagnetic theory, and
the Dirac equation for the study of an electron in presence of external
potentials, follow as natural extensions of the equations that rule the
electron in selfaction. The electromagnetic coupling constant ($\alpha$) and
the coupling constant ($\beta$) of a gauge invariant matrix vector potential
are interrelated by the equation that defines the electron structure. Here, two
bispinor components carry 1/3 and 2/3 of the physical properties of the
electron: electric charge, mass, spin and magnetic moment. These fractions of
the electron charge seem to be a feature common to both leptons and hadrons. An
eigenvalue equation involving the invariants of the selfpotentials ultimately
determines $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
