relativistic stars. Our approach to the static spherically symmetric solutions
of Einstein equations is based on a careful physical analysis of radial gauge
conditions.
  It turns out that there exist heavy black dwarfs: relativistic stars with
arbitrary large mass, which are to have arbitrary small radius and arbitrary
small luminosity. In the present article we mathematically prove this new
phenomena, using a detailed consideration of incompressible GR stars. We study
the whole two parameter family of solutions of extended TOV equations for
incompressible stars. This example is used to illustrate most of the basic
features of the new geometrical models of relativistic stars. Comparison with
newest observational data is discussed

(2002; hereafter P02) have reported extraordinary behaviour
of the iron K alpha line in the type 1 AGN Mrk 841. At the XMM-Newton/EPIC
resolution, a narrow line was observed in a short observation, which then
apparently disappeared around 0.5 days later when another observation was
performed. The limits are such that the line cannot both be narrow, and
variable at this level, as the light-travel time places the material at a
radius where broadening by the black hole's gravitational field is inevitable.
Adding an additional observation taken before the P02 data, we present a
different interpretation of the apparent variability. The data support the
hypothesis that the line in fact varies in width, not only in flux. Rather than
showing no line, and despite the strong Compton reflection component, the final
observation exhibits broad emission at ~ 6.2-6.4 keV, with a width of ~0.8 keV,
typical of a relativistic accretion disc. We suggest that the apparently narrow
line in the early observations arises from local illumination by a flare
inducing an hotspot in the inner disc, which then becomes progressively
broadened as the disc rotates.

For mid to late M dwarfs in young (<100 Myr) clusters, this variability is
generally periodic with amplitudes of up to a few tenths of a magnitude and
periods of between a few hours and several days. For older field dwarfs
(covering late M, L and T types) this variability is often nonperiodic with
smaller amplitudes (up to 0.1 mag in I) and timescales of order hours. The
former may be attributed to the rotational modulation of magnetically-induced
photospheric spots, as seen in higher mass T Tauri stars. The nonperiodic
variability, on the other hand, may be caused by a rapid evolution of surface
features (which 'mask' the otherwise observable rotational modulation). This
could be related to the formation and dissipation of inhomogeneities in dust
clouds in the photospheres of UCDs.

distribution of the different observed lines. We have found that in some cases
the observational results are not reproduced by the current theoretical pumping
models, either radiative or collisional. In particular, for IRC +10011, the v=1
J=1-0 and J=2-1 28SiO lines have different spatial distributions and emitting
region sizes, the J=2-1 emission being located in an outer region of the
envelope. For Chi Cyg, the distributions also differ, but the sizes of the
masing regions are comparable. We suggest that the line overlaps between
ro-vibrational transitions of two abundant molecular species, H2O and 28SiO, is
a possible explanation for the discrepancies found between the observations and
the theoretical predictions. We have introduced this overlapping process in the
calculations of the excitation of the SiO molecule. We conclude that the line
overlaps can strongly affect the excitation of SiO and may reproduce the
unexpected observational results for the two sources studied.

step, the stellar heating profile and radiative timescales were calculated
under planet-averaged insolation conditions. We find that 99.99% of the
incoming stellar flux has been absorbed before reaching the 7 bar level.
Stellar photons cannot therefore penetrate deeply enough to explain the large
radius of the planet. We derive a radiative time constant which increases with
depth and reaches about 8 hr at 0.1 bar and 2.3 days at 1 bar. Time-dependent
temperature profiles were also calculated, in the limit of a zonal wind that is
independent on height (i.e. solid-body rotation) and constant absorption
coefficients. We predict day-night variations of the effective temperature of
\~600 K, for an equatorial rotation rate of 1 km/s, in good agreement with the
predictions by Showman &Guillot (2002). This rotation rate yields day-to-night
temperature variations in excess of 600 K above the 0.1-bar level. These
variations rapidly decrease with depth below the 1-bar level and become
negligible below the ~5--bar level for rotation rates of at least 0.5 km/s. At
high altitudes (mbar pressures or less), the night temperatures are low enough
to allow sodium to condense into Na2S. Synthetic transit spectra of the visible
Na doublet show a much weaker sodium absorption on the morning limb than on the
evening limb. The calculated dimming of the sodium feature during planetary
transites agrees with the value reported by Charbonneau et al. (2002).

the gas in classical H II regions surrounding O stars, the presumed ionization
source for the WIM. In addition, we find differences in the physical conditions

that the filaments are regions of higher density, not geometrical projections

noise source is tiny, dynamically fluctuating bumps and valleys on the faces of
the arm-cavity mirrors, caused by random flow of heat in the mirrors' sapphire
substrates: so-called ""thermoelastic noise"". We propose replacing the
interferometers' baseline arm-cavity light beams, which have Gaussian-shaped
intensity profiles, by beams with mesa-shaped profiles that are flat in their
central ~7 cm of radius, and that then fall toward zero as quickly as is
allowed by diffraction in LIGO's 4 km arms. The mesa beams average the bumps
and valleys much more effectively than the Gaussian beams. As a result, if the
beam radii are adjusted so diffraction losses per bounce are about 10 ppm,
replacing Gaussian beams by mesa beams reduces the thermoelastic noise power by
about a factor 3. If other thermal noises are kept negligible, this will permit
advanced LIGO to beat the Standard Quantum Limit by about a factor 1.5 over a
bandwidth about equal to frequency, and the event rate for inspiraling neutron
star binaries will increase by about a factor 2.5. The desired mesa beams can
be produced from input, Gaussian-profile laser light, by changing the shapes of
the arm cavities' mirror faces from their baseline spherical shapes (with radii
of curvature of order 60 km) to Mexican-hat (MH) shapes that have a shallow
bump in the center but are otherwise much flatter in the central 10 cm than the
spherical mirrors, and then flare upward strongly in the outer 6 cm, like a
sombrero. We describe mesa beams and MH mirrors mathematically and we report
the results of extensive modeling calculations, which show that mesa-beam
interferometers are not much more sensitive than the Gaussian-beam
interferometers to errors in mirror figures, positions, and orientations.

analyze the amount of fine tuning required in various models, the problem of
decay at the end of inflation and the generation of baryons after inflation. We
find that the most natural setting for HI is in supersymmetric models with
non-renormalizable couplings. Furthermore, we argue that almost inevitably, one
of the fields involved is a modulus, with Planck scale variation. The resulting
moduli problem can be solved in two ways: either by a massive modulus (which
requires some fine tuning), or an enhanced symmetry point, in which the moduli
becomes strongly coupled to the Standard Model. Various possibilities for
baryon production are discussed.

transition in its 6-dimensional submanifold which is isomorphic to a resolved

Gopakumar-Vafa large $N$ superstring duality of \cite{gv, v}; IIB superstring
theory compactified on the $Spin(7)$ manifold with $N$ space-filling D5-branes

In particular we compute the number of rational points of the manifolds as a
function of the complex structure parameters. The data of the number of
rational points of a Calabi--Yau $X/\mathbb{F}_q$ can be encoded in a
generating function known as the congruent zeta function. The Weil Conjectures
(proved in the 1970s) show that for smooth varieties, these functions take a
very interesting form in terms of the Betti numbers of the variety. This has
interesting implications for mirror symmetry, as mirror symmetry exchanges the
odd and even Betti numbers. Here the zeta functions for a one-parameter family
of K3 surfaces, $\mathbb{P}_3[4]$, and a two-parameter family of octics in
weighted projective space, $\mathbb{P}_4{}^{(1, 1, 2, 2, 2)} [8]$, are
computed. The form of the zeta function at points in the moduli space of
complex structures where the manifold is singular (where the Weil conjectures
apart from rationality are not applicable), is investigated. The zeta function
appears to be sensitive to monomial and non-monomial deformations of complex
structure (or equivalently on the mirror side, toric and non-toric divisors).
Various conjectures about the form of the zeta function for mirror symmetric
pairs are made in light of the results of this calculation. Connections with
$L$-functions associated to both elliptic and Siegel modular forms are
suggested.

scattering by finite obstacles and by periodic structures. Numerical results it

Drinfeld and further studied by Laumon--Rapoport--Stuhler and others. They can
be viewed as function field analogues of elliptic curves and hence are objects
""of dimension 1"". Their higher dimensional generalisations are called abelian
sheaves. In the analogy between function fields and number fields, abelian
sheaves are counterparts of abelian varieties. In this article we study the
moduli spaces of abelian sheaves and prove that they are algebraic stacks. We
further transfer results of Cerednik--Drinfeld and Rapoport--Zink on the
uniformization of Shimura varieties to the setting of abelian sheaves. Actually
the analogy of the Cerednik--Drinfeld uniformization is nothing but the
uniformization of the moduli schemes of Drinfeld modules by the Drinfeld upper
half space. Our results generalise this uniformization. The proof closely
follows the ideas of Rapoport--Zink. In particular, analogies of $p$-divisible
groups play an important role. As a crucial intermediate step we prove that in
a family of abelian sheaves with good reduction at infinity, the set of points
where the abelian sheaf is uniformizable in the sense of Anderson, is formally
closed.

two critical values of the coupling strength -- signaling the onset into the
system of a finite magnetization and of the total magnetization, respectively
-- are found and their dependence upon the range of the interaction is
explored. The spin response function of the system in the region where the
spin-rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken is also studied. For a
ferromagnetic interaction the spin response along the direction of the
spontaneous magnetization occurs in the particle-hole continuum and displays,
for not too large momentum transfers, two distinct peaks. The response along
the direction orthogonal to the spontaneous magnetization displays instead,
beyond a softened and depleted particle-hole continuum, a collective mode to be
identified with a Goldstone boson of type II. Notably, the random phase
approximation on a Hartree-Fock basis accounts for it, in particular for its
quadratic -- close to the origin -- dispersion relation. It is shown that the
Goldstone boson contributes to the saturation of the energy-weighted sum rule

the upper critical value of the interaction strength) and continues to grow as

expressed, elementary embeddings along with the Wholeness Axiom are suggested.
It is shown how features of wholeness such as wholeness being indescribable,
more than the sum of parts, locally accessible and giving rise to a
self-similar, or holographic, type of order are reflected in the mathematics.
It is also shown how all the sets in the mathematical universe may be expressed
as emerging from the dynamics of wholeness. Moreover, it is indicated how the
mathematics may be further developed so as to connect up with a physical
interpretation.

  2004, proceedings published by AIP and edited by M.S. El-Genk",,"10.1063/1.1649691",,"physics.gen-ph",,"  It is known that the value L of the vacuum energy density affects the
propagation equation for gravitons: A mass term appears in the propagation
equation, such that m^2=-L. As a consequence, the polarization states of
gravitons also change. This effect of the L-term has been confirmed by recent
calculations in a curved background, which is the only proper setting, since
solutions of the classical Einstein equations in the presence of a L-term
represent a space with constant curvature. A real value for the mass (when L<0)
will show up as a slight exponential damping in the gravitational potential,
which is however strongly constrained by astronomical data. The consequences of
an imaginary mass (for L>0) are still unclear; on general grounds, one can
expect the onset of instabilities in this case. This is also confirmed by
numerical simulations of quantum gravity which became recently available. These
properties gain a special interest in consideration of the following. (1) The
most recent cosmological data indicate that L is positive and of the order of
0.1 J/m^3. Is this value compatible with a stable propagation of gravitons? (2)
The answer to the previous question lies perhaps in the scale dependence of the
effective value of L. L may be negative at the small distance/large energy
scale at which the quantum behavior of gravitational fields and waves becomes
relevant. Furthermore, local contributions to the vacuum energy density (in
superconductors in certain states, and in very strong static electromagnetic
fields) can change locally the sign of L, and so affect locally the propagation
and the properties of gravitons. The graviton wavefunction, for different
values of the parameters, may be characterized by superluminal phase velocity
or by unitarity only in imaginary valued time.

depends on highly reproducible dynamics of regulatory processes. Biological
information processing elements, however, are intrinsically noisy (genetic
switches, neurons, etc.). Such noise poses severe stability problems to system
behavior as it tends to desynchronize system dynamics (e.g. via fluctuating
response or transmission time of the elements). Synchronicity in parallel
information processing is not readily sustained in the absence of a central
clock. Here we analyze the influence of topology on synchronicity in networks
of autonomous noisy elements. In numerical and analytical studies we find a
clear distinction between non-reliable and reliable dynamical attractors,
depending on the topology of the circuit. In the reliable cases, synchronicity
is sustained, while in the unreliable scenario, fluctuating responses of single
elements can gradually desynchronize the system, leading to non-reproducible
behavior. We find that the fraction of reliable dynamical attractors strongly
correlates with the underlying circuitry. Our model suggests that the observed
motif structure of biological signaling networks is shaped by the biological
requirement for reproducibility of attractors.

inhomogeneous nondispersive and lossless dielectric is described with a dipole
Hamiltonian that is based on a canonical quantization theory. The dielectric is
described macroscopically by a position-dependent dielectric function and the
atoms as microscopic harmonic oscillators. We identify and discuss the role of
several types of Green tensors that describe the spatio-temporal propagation of
field operators. After integrating out the atomic degrees of freedom, a
multiple-scattering formalism emerges in which an exact Lippmann-Schwinger
equation for the electric field operator plays a central role. The equation
describes atoms as point sources and point scatterers for light. First,
single-atom properties are calculated such as position-dependent
spontaneous-emission rates as well as differential cross sections for elastic
scattering and for resonance fluorescence. Secondly, multi-atom processes are
studied. It is shown that the medium modifies both the resonant and the static
parts of the dipole-dipole interactions. These interatomic interactions may
cause the atoms to scatter and emit light cooperatively. Unlike in free space,
differences in position-dependent emission rates and radiative line shifts
influence cooperative decay in the dielectric. As a generic example, it is
shown that near a partially reflecting plane there is a sharp transition from
two-atom superradiance to single-atom emission as the atomic positions are
varied.

complex Hilbert space. Thus dynamics of the wave function can be considered as
Hilbert space projections of realistic dynamics in a ``prespace''. The basic
condition for representing of the prespace-dynamics is the law of statistical
conservation of energy -- conservation of probabilities. Construction of the
dynamical representation is an important step in the development of contextual
statistical viewpoint to quantum processes. But the contextual statistical
model is essentially more general than the quantum one. Therefore in general
the Hilbert space projection of the ``prespace'' dynamics can be nonlinear and
even irreversible (but it is always unitary). There were found conditions of
linearity and reversibility of the Hilbert space dynamical projection. We also
found conditions for the conventional Schroedinger dynamics (including
time-dependent Hamiltonians). We remark that in general even the Schroedinger
dynamics is based just on the statistical conservation of energy; for
individual systems the law of conservation of energy can be violated (at least
in our theoretical model).
