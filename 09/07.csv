X-ray observation of the Coma cluster region with the IBIS instrument onboard
INTEGRAL. In addition to the Coma cluster, the final 20-50 keV image contains
12 serendipitous sources with statistical significance >4sigma. We use these
data (after correcting for expected number of false detections) to extend the
extragalactic source counts in the 20-50 keV energy band down to a limiting
flux of 1.0e-11 erg/s/cm^2 (~ 1mCrab). This is a more than a factor of 10
improvement in sensitivity compared to the previous results in this energy band
obtained with the HEAO-1 A4 instrument. The derived source counts are
consistent with the Euclidean relation, N(>f) ~ f**(-3/2). A large fraction of
identified serendipitous sources are low-redshift, z<0.02, AGNs, mostly of
Seyfert 1 type. The surface density of hard X-ray sources is 0.014 +- 0.005 per
square degree above a flux threshold of 1e-11 erg/s/cm^2. These sources
directly account for ~3% of the cosmic X-ray background in the 20-50 keV energy
band. Given the low redshift depth of our sample, we expect that similar
sources at higher redshifts account for a significant fraction of the hard
X-ray background. Our field covers only 3% of the sky; a systematic analysis of
other extragalactic INTEGRAL observations can produce much larger source
samples and is, therefore, critically important.

examine X-ray time series variability seeking power density spectra (PDS)
typical of LMXBs accreting at a low accretion rate (which we refer to as Type A
PDS); these are very similar for black hole and neutron star LMXBs. Galactic
neutron star LMXBs exhibit Type A PDS at low luminosities (~10^36--10^37 erg/s)
while black hole LMXBs can exhibit them at luminosities >10^38 erg/s. We
propose that Type A PDS are confined to luminosities below a critical fraction
of the Eddington limit, $l_c$ that is constant for all LMXBs; we have examined
asample of black hole and neutron star LMXBs and find they are all consistent
with $l_c$ = 0.10+/-0.04 in the 0.3--10 keV band. We present luminosity and PDS
data from 167 observations of X-ray binaries in M31 that provide strong support
for our hypothesis. Since the theoretical maximum mass for a neutron star is
\~3.1 M_Sun, we therefore assert that any LMXB that exhibits a Type A PDS at a
0.3--10 keV luminosity greater than 4 x 10^37 erg/s is likely to contain a
black hole primary. We have found eleven new black hole candidates in M31 using
this method. We focus on XMM-Newton observations of RX J0042.4+4112, an X-ray
source in M31 and find the mass of the primary to be 7+/-2 M_Sun, if our
assumptions are correct. Furthermore, RX J0042.4+4112 is consistently bright in
\~40 observations made over 23 years, and is likely to be a persistently bright
LMXB; by contrast all known Galactic black hole LMXBs are transient. Hence our
method may be used to find black holes in known, persistently bright Galactic
LMXBs and also in LMXBs in other galaxies.

counter-images are identified and incorporated to improve the model, yielding a
total of 106 images of 30 multiply lensed background galaxies, spanning a wide
redshift range, 1.0$<$z$<$5.5. The resulting mass map is more circular in
projection than the clumpy distribution of cluster galaxies and the light is
more concentrated than the mass within $r<50kpc/h$. The projected mass profile
flattens steadily towards the center with a shallow mean slope of
$d\log\Sigma/d\log r \simeq -0.55\pm0.1$, over the observed range,
r$<250kpc/h$, matching well an NFW profile, but with a relatively high
concentration, $C_{vir}=8.2^{+2.1}_{-1.8}$. A softened isothermal profile
($r_{core}=20\pm2$\arcs) is not conclusively excluded, illustrating that
lensing constrains only projected quantities. Regarding cosmology, we clearly
detect the purely geometric increase of bend-angles with redshift. The
dependence on the cosmological parameters is weak due to the proximity of
A1689, $z=0.18$, constraining the locus, $\Omega_M+\Omega_{\Lambda} \leq 1.2$.
This consistency with standard cosmology provides independent support for our
model, because the redshift information is not required to derive an accurate
mass map. Similarly, the relative fluxes of the multiple images are reproduced
well by our best fitting lens model.

compute the three-dimensional two-point galaxy correlation function in the

and observational biases affect the measurements and identify the methods to
correct them. We quantify the accuracy of our correction method using an
ensemble of fifty mock galaxy surveys generated with the GalICS semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation which incorporate the same selection biases and
tiling strategy as the real data does. We demonstrate that we are able to
recover the real-space two-point correlation function xi(s) to an accuracy
better than 10% on scales larger than 1 h^{-1} Mpc, and of about 30% on scales
below 1 h^{-1} Mpc, with the sampling strategy used for the first epoch VVDS
data. The projected correlation function w_p(r_p) is recovered with an accuracy
better than 10% on all scales 0.1 <= r <= 10 h^{-1} Mpc. There is a tendency
for a small but systematic under-estimate of the correlation length derived
from w_p(r_p) of 6% on average, remaining after our correction process. The
large number of simulated surveys allows us to provide a reliable estimate of
the cosmic error on the measurements of the correlation length r_0, of about
15-20% for the first epoch VVDS observation (Le Fevre et al.2004,

constant, $\alpha\equiv e^2/\hbar c$, over the history of the Universe. This
was concluded from a detailed study of the relative positions of redshifted
optical quasar absorption spectra. However, {\it radio} absorption lines at
high redshift offer a much higher sensitivity to a cosmological change in
$\alpha$ than optical lines. Furthermore, through the comparison of various
radio transitions, \HI, OH and millimetre molecular (e.g. CO) lines, any
variations in the proton g-factor, $g_p$, and the ratio of electron/proton
masses, $\mu\equiv m_e/m_p$, may also be constrained. Presently, however,
systems exhibiting redshifted radio lines are rare with the bias being towards
those associated with optically selected QSOs. With its unprecedented
sensitivity, large bandwidth and wide field of view, the SKA will prove
paramount in surveying the sky for absorbers unbiased by dust extinction. This
is expected to yield whole new samples of \HI ~and OH rich systems, the latter
of which will prove a useful diagnostic in finding redshifted millimetre
absorbers. As well as uncovering many new systems through these blind surveys,
the SKA will enable the detection of \HI ~absorption in many more of the
present optical sample -- down to column densities of $\sim10^{17}$ \scm, or
$\gapp2$ orders of magnitude the sensitivity of the current limits. Armed with
these large samples together with the high spectral resolutions, available from
the purely radio comparisons, the SKA will provide statistically sound
measurements of the values of these fundamental constants in the early
Universe, thus providing a physical test of Grand Unified Theories.

found that the contour map of these observables can be well approximated by a
series of concentric ellipses with scale-dependent eccentricities. The
statistical distribution of their eccentricities (or equivalently axial ratios)
is analyzed by taking into account the orientation of clusters with respect to
the line of sight and the distribution of the axial ratios and the
concentration parameters of dark matter halos. For clusters of mass
$10^{13}h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$ at redshift $z=0$, the axial ratio is peaked at
$\eta \sim 0.9$ for both SZ and X-ray profiles. For larger clusters, the
deviation from circular distributions is more apparent, with $\eta$ peaked at
$\eta \sim 0.85$ for $M=10^{15}h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$. To be more close to
observations, we further study the axial-ratio distribution for mass-limited
cluster samples with the number distribution of clusters at different redshifts
described by a modified Press-Schechter model. For a mass limit of value
$M_{lim}=10^{14}h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$, the average axial ratio is $<\eta > \sim

with a compact jet dominating the spectral energy distribution at radio

XTE J1650-50 may be dominated by Compton processes (either inverse
Comptonization of thermal disk photons and/or SSC from the base of the compact

interstellar medium (ISM) have found significant evidence for small-scale
variations in the interstellar gas on scales less than or equal to 1 pc. To
better understand the nature of small-scale variations in the ISM, we have used
the KPNO WIYN Hydra multi-object spectrograph, which has a mapping advantage
over the single-axis, single-scale limitations of studies using high proper
motion stars and binary stars, to obtain moderate resolution (~12 km/s)
interstellar Na I D absorption spectra of 172 stars toward the double open
cluster h and Chi Persei. All of the sightlines toward the 150 stars with
spectra that reveal absorption from the Perseus spiral arm show different
interstellar Na I D absorption profiles in the Perseus arm gas. Additionally,
we have utilized the KPNO Coude Feed spectrograph to obtain high-resolution (~3
km/s) interstellar Na I D absorption spectra of 24 of the brighter stars toward
h and Chi Per. These spectra reveal an even greater complexity in the
interstellar Na I D absorption in the Perseus arm gas and show individual
components changing in number, velocity, and strength from sightline to
sightline. If each of these individual velocity components represents an
isolated cloud, then it would appear that the ISM of the Perseus arm gas
consists of many small clouds. Although the absorption profiles vary even on
the smallest scales probed by these high-resolution data (~30"";~0.35pc), our
analysis reveals that some interstellar Na I D absorption components from
sightline to sightline are related, implying that the ISM toward h and Chi Per
is probably comprised of sheets of gas in which we detect variations due to
differences in the local physical conditions of the gas.

the number of nodes. Models of such accelerated growth have been considered
earlier with deterministic and stochastic number of links. Here we consider
stochastic accelerated growth in a network where links are directed. With the
number of out-going links following a power law distribution, the results are
similar to the undirected case. As the accelerated growth is enhanced, the
degree distribution becomes independent of the ``initial attractiveness'', a
parameter which plays a key role in directed networks. As an example of a
directed model with accelerated growth, the citation network is considered, in
which the distribution of the number of outgoing link has an exponential tail.
The role of accelerated growth is examined here with two different growth laws.

shifting the antibonding bands. In the low-temperature charge-ordered phase,
the spectrum depends on whether the ordering is driven by the Coulomb repulsion
or by the coupling to a static lattice distortion. The small change of the
experimentally observed gap upon charge ordering implies that the lattice
coupling plays an important role in this ordering. Inter-ladder coupling is
straightforward to include within our method. We show that it has only a minor

motifs: subgraphs that recur in the network much more often than in randomized
networks. To understand the origin of the network motifs in these networks, it
is important to study the subgraphs and network motifs that arise solely from
geometric constraints. To address this, we analyze geometric network models, in
which nodes are arranged on a lattice and edges are formed with a probability
that decays with the distance between nodes. We present analytical solutions
for the numbers of all 3 and 4-node subgraphs, in both directed and
non-directed geometric networks. We also analyze geometric networks with
arbitrary degree sequences, and models with a field that biases for directed
edges in one direction. Scaling rules for scaling of subgraph numbers with
system size, lattice dimension and interaction range are given. Several
invariant measures are found, such as the ratio of feedback and feed-forward
loops, which do not depend on system size, dimension or connectivity function.
We find that network motifs in many real-world networks, including social
networks and neuronal networks, are not captured solely by these geometric
models. This is in line with recent evidence that biological network motifs
were selected as basic circuit elements with defined information-processing
functions.

function for the self-energy at zero frequency but at all wave vectors within
an approximation which truncates the flow equations of the irreducible vertices

the asymptotic behavior Sigma(k) \propto k^{2 - eta}, and in the
short-wavelength regime the behavior is Sigma(k) \propto k^{2(D-3)} in D>3. In
D=3, we recover the logarithmic divergence Sigma(k) \propto ln(k/k_c)

1-p and -J with p. This model exhibits a confinement-Higgs phase transition. We
numerically obtain a phase boundary curve in the (p-T)-plane where T is the
""temperature"" measured in unit of J/k_B. This model plays an important role in
estimating the accuracy threshold of a quantum memory of a toric code. In this
paper, we are mainly interested in its ""self-duality"" aspect, and the
relationship with the random-bond Ising model(RBIM) in 2-dimensions. The
""self-duality"" argument can be applied both for RPGM and RBIM, giving the same
duality equations, hence predicting the same phase boundary. The phase boundary
curve obtained by our numerical simulation almost coincides with this predicted
phase boundary at the high-temperature region. The phase transition is of first
order for relatively small values of p < 0.08, but becomes of second order for
larger p. The value of p at the intersection of the phase boundary curve and
the Nishimori line is regarded as the accuracy threshold of errors in a toric
quantum memory. It is estimated as p=0.110\pm0.002, which is very close to the
value conjectured by Takeda and Nishimori through the ""self-duality"" argument.

is reconstructed by a contactless inductive flow tomography (CIFT). The
underlying theory is presented within the framework of an integral equation
system that governs the magnetic field distribution in a moving electrically
conducting fluid. For small magnetic Reynolds numbers this integral equation
system can be cast into a linear inverse problem for the determination of the
velocity field from externally measured magnetic fields. A robust
reconstruction of the large scale velocity field is already achieved by
applying the external magnetic field alternately in two orthogonal directions
and measuring the corresponding sets of induced magnetic fields. Kelvin's
theorem is exploited to regularize the resulting velocity field by using the
kinetic energy of the flow as a regularizing functional. The results of the new
technique are shown to be in satisfactory agreement with ultrasonic
measurements.

for such instabilities in the transition to turbulence. A multigrid Poisson

free, unperturbed spontaneous decay. The result for the natural lifetime of the
D$_{5/2}$ state of 1168(9) ms agrees excellently with the most precise
published value. The lifetime of the D$_{3/2}$ state is measured with a single

uncertainty of previous results by a factor of four. We compare these
experimental lifetimes to high-precision ab initio all order calculations and
find a very good agreement. These calculations represent an excellent test of
high-precision atomic theory and will serve as a benchmark for the study of
parity nonconservation in Ba$^+$ which has similar atomic structure.

taking the kicked Harper model as an example. This well-studied system has a
rich variety of dynamical behavior depending on parameters, displays
interesting phenomena such as fractal spectra, mixed phase space, dynamical
localization, anomalous diffusion, or partial delocalization, and can describe
electrons in a magnetic field. Three different quantum algorithms are presented
and analyzed, enabling to simulate efficiently the evolution operator of this
system with different precision using different resources. Depending on the
parameters chosen, the system is near-integrable, localized, or partially
delocalized. In each case we identify transport or spectral quantities which
can be obtained more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical one.
In most cases, a polynomial gain compared to classical algorithms is obtained,
which can be quadratic or less depending on the parameter regime. We also
present the effects of static imperfections on the quantities selected, and
show that depending on the regime of parameters, very different behaviors are
observed. Some quantities can be obtained reliably with moderate levels of
imperfection, whereas others are exponentially sensitive to imperfection
strength. In particular, the imperfection threshold for delocalization becomes
exponentially small in the partially delocalized regime. Our results show that
interesting behavior can be observed with as little as 7-8 qubits, and can be
reliably measured in presence of moderate levels of internal imperfections.
