sheets. Unlike the case of infinite sheets, such configurations do not
constitute equilibrium states but instead are subject to global collapse unless
countered by pressure forces or rotation. The initial effect of finite geometry
is to promote concentrations of material at the edges of the sheet. If the
sheet is not perfectly circular, gravitational focussing results in enhanced
concentrations of mass. In the second-most simple geometry, that of an
elliptical outer boundary, the general result is collapse to a filamentary
structure with the densest concentrations of mass at the ends of the filament.
We suggest that these simple calculations have interesting implications for the
gravitational evolution of overall molecular cloud structure, envisioning that
such clouds might originate as roughly sheetlike sections of gas accumulated as
a result of large-scale flows in the local interstellar medium. We show some
examples of local clouds with overall filamentary shape and denser
concentrations of mass and star clusters near the ends of the overall extended
structure, suggestive of our simple ellipse collapse calculations. We suggest
that cluster-forming gas is often concentrated as a result of gravity acting on
irregular boundaries; this mechanism can result in very rapid infall of gas
which may be of importance to the formation of massive stars. This picture
suggests that much of the supersonic ``turbulence'' observed in molecular
clouds might be gravitationally-generated. Our results may provide impetus for
further theoretical explorations of global gravitational effects in molecular
clouds and their implications for generating the substructure needed for
fragmentation into stars and clusters.

their associated dark-matter halos imply that outflows from accreting black
holes provide a feedback mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Accreting black
holes with weak or undetectable radio jets (radio-quiet quasars) outnumber
those with powerful jets (radio-loud quasars) by a factor ~10-100, so
powerful-jet outflows are often neglected. However, whenever powerful jets are
triggered, there is a dramatic (factor >100) step-function increase in the
efficiency of feedback. We use a feedback model, together with the measured
space density of flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars, to show that a powerful-jet
episode probably occurred in every protocluster in the Universe. Before jet
triggering, there was time for gravitational collapse to create many (~10-100)
surrounding protogalaxies massive enough to host radio-quiet quasars. After
triggering, the powerful jet pushes back and heats ionized gas so that it
cannot fall onto these protogalaxies and cool. Once neutral/molecular gas
reservoirs become exhausted, there is a synchronized shut down in both
star-formation and black-hole activity throughout the protocluster. These
considerations imply that radio-loud quasars have a profound influence on the
evolution of all the galaxies seen in clusters today.

changes of the obscuring gas column density, or to a transient dimming of the

Effects of Stellar Temperature","16 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We model how the mid-infrared colors of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) vary
with stellar temperature. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of each object
has contributions from thermal emission of circumstellar dust, from direct
stellar photospheric emission, and from scattered stellar emission. We first
isolate the effects of stellar contributions (direct+scattered) to the SED
using homologous ""Class I"" models, where the shape of the thermal contribution
to the SED remains constant. Stellar light contributes relatively more to the
MIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars (Tstar ~4000 K) because the
emission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal
radiation. Next we consider realistic Class 0, I, and II source models and find
that the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is
that of the inner disk wall: In high-Tstar models, the dust destruction radius
is much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes
relatively more to the 2-10 um flux. This effect partially offsets that of the
stellar contribution leading to varying behaviors of the 2-10 um flux.
  Our modeled MIR protostellar colors have implications for interpretations of
Spitzer IRAC observations of star formation regions: It is commonly assumed
that the slope of the SED at 1-10 um is directly related to evolutionary state.
We show that inclination effects, aperture size, scattered light, and stellar
temperature cause a broad spread in the colors of a source at a single
evolutionary state. Color magnitude diagrams can help sort out these effects by
separating sources with different Tstar based on their different brightness
(for sources at the same distance).

potentially yield candidate topologically lensed pairs of sets of objects,
which would be a sign of the global topology of the Universe. In the spherical
case, a necessary condition, which does not exist for either null or negative
curvature, can be used to falsify such hypotheses, without needing to loop
through a list of individual spherical 3-manifolds. This condition is that the
isometry between the two sets of objects must be a root of the identity
isometry in the covering space S^3. This enables numerical falsification of
topological lensing hypotheses without needing to assume any particular
spherical 3-manifold. By embedding S^3 in R^4, this condition can be expressed
as the requirement that M^n = I for an integer n, where M is the matrix
representation of the hypothesised lensing isometry and I is the identity.
Moreover, this test becomes even simpler with the requirement that the two
rotation angles, theta, phi, corresponding to the given isometry, satisfy 2\pi

two eigenplanes of the matrix M. A GNU General Public Licence numerical

highest HI column densities at any redshift: N(HI)=4.2E21 cm^{-2}. The
metal-line data, presented here for the first time, reveal that these DLAs are
noteworthy for several other reasons as well. 1) The Q0933+733 DLA exhibits
simple kinematic structure with unusually narrow velocity widths as measured
from its unsaturated metal lines (delta v=16 km/s). At 2.6% solar, it has the
second lowest metallicity at z<2. 2) The Q0948+433 DLA has among the strongest
metal-line transitions of any known DLA. The saturated SiII1808 line implies a
high metallicity ([Si/H]> -1) and a significant alpha-enhancement. The strong
metal lines of this DLA have made possible the detection of TiII1910, CoII2012,
and MgI2026. 3) We find that the relative gas-phase abundances of both DLAs
follow the general trend seen at high redshift, e.g., enhanced Zn/Fe and Si/Fe,
and sub-solar Mn/Fe, indicating that there is little evolution in the
nucleosynthetic patterns of DLAs down to this epoch. 4) Their high HI column
densities imply that these DLAs dominate the column density-weighted cosmic
mean metallicity, <Z>, of the universe at z<1.5. Using the 15 DLAs with
measured metallicities in the redshift interval 0.4<z<1.5, we find <Z> =
-0.89^{+0.40}_{-0.33}, where the uncertainties are 95% confidence limits.

to each other; their respective velocity dispersions are 865 km/s (113 members)
and 282 km/s (36 members). MS2053's total dynamical mass is 1.2x10^15 Msun.
MS2053 is a classic Butcher-Oemler cluster with a high fraction of blue members
(24%) and an even higher fraction of star-forming members (44%), as determined
from their [OII] emission. The number fraction of blue/star-forming galaxies is
much higher in the infalling structure than in the main cluster. This result is
the most direct evidence to date that the Butcher-Oemler effect is linked to
galaxy infall. In terms of their colors, luminosities, estimated internal
velocity dispersions, and [OII] equivalent widths, the infalling galaxies are
indistinguishable from the field population. MS2053's deficit of S0 galaxies
combined with its overabundance of blue spirals implies that many of these
late-types will evolve into S0 members. The properties of the blue cluster
members in both the main cluster and infalling structure indicate they will
evolve into low mass, L<L* galaxies with extended star formation histories like
that of low mass S0's in Coma. Our observations show that most of MS2053's blue

Most objects exhibit a spectral break around 1100 Angstrom. Although this
result is formally associated with large uncertainty for some objects, there is
strong evidence in the data that the far-ultraviolet spectral region is below
the extrapolation of the near-ultraviolet-optical slope, indicating a spectral
break around 1100 Angstrom. We compare the behavior of our sample to those of
non-LTE thin-disk models covering a range in black-hole mass, Eddington ratio,
disk inclination, and other parameters. The distribution of ultraviolet-optical
spectral indices redward of the break, and far-ultraviolet indices shortward of
the break, are in rough agreement with the models. However, we do not see a
correlation between the far-ultraviolet spectral index and the black hole mass,
as seen in some accretion disk models. We argue that the observed spectral
break is intrinsic to AGNs, although intrinsic reddening as well as
Comptonization can strongly affect the far-ultraviolet spectral index. We make

star from a surrounding accretion disc. For the first time, we include the
opening of dipolar magnetic field lines due to the differential rotation
between the star and disc, so the magnetic topology then depends on the
strength of the magnetic coupling to the disc. This coupling is determined by
the effective slip rate of magnetic field lines that penetrate the diffusive
disc. Stronger coupling (i.e., lower slip rate) leads to a more open topology
and thus to a weaker magnetic torque on the star from the disc. In the expected
strong coupling regime, we find that the spin-down torque on the star is more
than an order of magnitude smaller than calculated by previous models. We also
use our general approach to examine the equilibrium (`disc-locked') state, in
which the net torque on the star is zero. In this state, we show that the
stellar spin rate is roughly an order of magnitude faster than predicted by
previous models. This challenges the idea that slowly-rotating, accreting
protostars are disc locked. Furthermore, when the field is sufficiently open
(e.g., for mass accretion rates > 5 x 10^{-9} M_sun / yr, for typical accreting
protostars), the star will receive no magnetic spin-down torque from the disc
at all. We therefore conclude that protostars must experience a spin-down
torque from a source that has not yet been considered in the star-disc torque
models--possibly from a stellar wind along the open field lines.

relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic electron-positron jet
front propagating into an ambient electron-positron plasma with and without
initial magnetic fields. We find small differences in the results for no
ambient and modest ambient magnetic fields. New simulations show that the
Weibel instability created in the collisionless shock front accelerates jet and
ambient particles both perpendicular and parallel to the jet propagation
direction. Furthermore, the non-linear fluctuation amplitudes of densities,
currents, electric, and magnetic fields in the electron-positron shock are
larger than those found in the electron-ion shock studied in a previous paper
at the comparable simulation time. This comes from the fact that both electrons
and positrons contribute to generation of the Weibel instability. Additionally,
we have performed simulations with different electron skin depths. We find that
growth times scale inversely with the plasma frequency, and the sizes of
structures created by the Weibel instability scale proportional to the electron
skin depth. This is the expected result and indicates that the simulations have
sufficient grid resolution. The simulation results show that the Weibel
instability is responsible for generating and amplifying nonuniform,
small-scale magnetic fields which contribute to the electron's (positron's)
transverse deflection behind the jet head.

on the mass ratio of the last major merger, is not able to reproduce the
observation that the fraction of boxy and disky ellipticals depends on galaxy
luminosity. The observations can however be reproduce with the following
reasonable assumptions: (i) equal-mass mergers lead to boxy ellipticals and
unequal-mass mergers produce disky ellipticals (as motivated by N-body
simulations) (ii) major mergers between bulge-dominated galaxies result always
in boxy ellipticals, independent of the mass ratio, (iii) merger remnants that
subsequently accrete gas leading to a secondary stellar disk with more than $20
%$ the total stellar fraction are always disky. Boxy and disky ellipticals can
be divided into two subclasses, depending on their formation history. Boxy
ellipticals either formed by equal mass mergers of disk galaxies or by major
mergers of early-type galaxies. We find that disky ellipticals are indicators
of unequal-mass mergers or late gas infall. Disky ellipticals with high
luminosities preferentially are 1-component systems that result from unequal
mass mergers whereas low-luminosity disky ellipticals are more likely to harbor
secondary disk components. In addition, the fraction of disky ellipticals with
secular disk components should increase in regions with higher galaxy
densities. Taking into account the conversion of cuspy cores into flat
low-density cores by black hole merging we find that disky ellipticals should
contain central density cusps whereas boxy ellipticals should in general be
characterized by flat cores.

including six red giants and one post-AGB star. We find significant differences
in the gravities determined using photometry and those obtained from ionization
balance, which suggests that non-LTE effects are important for these
low-gravity, metal-poor stars. We adopt an iron abundance using photometric
gravities and Fe II lines to minimize those effects, finding [Fe/H] = -2.16 +/-
0.02. For element-to-iron ratios,we rely on neutral lines vs. Fe I and ionized
lines vs. FeII (except for [O/Fe]) to also minimize non-LTE effects.
  We find variations in the abundances of sodium among the program stars.
However, there is no correlation (or anti-correlation) with the oxygen
abundances. Further, the post-AGB star has a normal (low) abundance of sodium.
Both of these facts add further support to the idea that the variations seen
among some light elements within individual globular clusters arises from
primordial variations, and not from deep mixing.
  M68, like M15, shows elevated abundances of silicon compared to other
globular clusters and comparable metallicity field stars. But M68 deviates even
more in showing a relative underabundance of titanium. We speculate that in
M68, titanium is behaving like an iron-peak element rather than its more
commonly observed adherence to enhancements seen in the ""alpha"" elements such
as magnesium, silicon, and calcium. We interpret this result as implying that
the chemical enrichment seen in M68 may have arisen from contributions from
supernovae with somewhat more massive progenitors than contribute normally to
abundances seen in other globular clusters.

use a large--scale hydrodynamical simulation of a concordance $\Lambda$CDM
model, to investigate the possible thermal origin for such an excess in a set
of 20 simulated clusters having temperatures in the range 1--7 keV. Simulated
clusters are analysed by mimicking the observational procedure applied to
ROSAT--PSPC data, which for the first time showed evidences for the soft X-ray
excess. For cluster--centric distances $0.4< R/R_{\rm vir}< 0.7$ we detect a
significant excess in most of the simulated clusters, whose relative amount
changes from cluster to cluster and, for the same cluster, by changing the
projection direction. In about 30 per cent of the cases, the soft X-ray flux is
measured to be at least 50 per cent larger than predicted by the
one--temperature plasma model. We find that this excess is generated in most
cases within the cluster virialized regions. It is mainly contributed by
low--entropy and high--density gas associated with merging sub--halos, rather
than to diffuse warm gas. Only in a few cases the excess arises from
fore/background groups observed in projection, while no evidence is found for a
significant contribution from gas lying within large--scale filaments. We
compute the distribution of the relative soft excess, as a function of the
cluster--centric distance, and compare it with the observational result by
Bonamente et al. (2003) for the Coma cluster. Similar to observations, we find
that the relative excess increases with the distance from the cluster center,
with no significant excess detected for $R<0.4R_{\rm vir}$. (abridged)

ten times higher ($\sim 1 M_\odot$ yr pc$^{-1}$) than the average accretion
rate. The rapid growth of the inner core is associated with the major merger
events with a time-delay. We also find that the spin-axis of the gas core
frequently changes. As a result, the angular momentum vector of the central

results suggest that if a constant fraction of the baryonic mass in the central

to reduce the density and thus luminosity of the intragroup gas. Given this,
groups should also should show a steep relationship between X-ray luminosity
and velocity dispersion. However, previous work suggests that this is not the
case with many measuring slopes flatter than the cluster relation.
  Examining the group L_X:\sigma relation shows that much of the flattening is
caused by a small subset of groups which show very high X-ray luminosities for
their velocity dispersions (or vice versa).
  Detailed Chandra study of two such groups shows that earlier ROSAT results

consolidates the fact already inferred from optical studies that their AGNs
have only a relatively low luminosity. Also the FR1 galaxies show a high

luminosity is substantially powered by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF)
of the giant elliptical hosts. Finally, we discuss the FR1-FR2 morphological
dichotomy. FR1 galaxies do not have more interstellar matter (ISM) than FR2s as
traced -- on the large scale -- by the cool FIR emitting dust and -- in the
nuclear region -- by the warm MIR emitting dust. Due to the lack of central gas
we suggest that the black holes of our FR1 galaxies are fed at a lower

diagrams in antiferroelectric liquid crystals (AFLCs) as a function of optical
purity and temperature. Recent experiments have shown that in some systems the
number of phases is reduced if the optical purity is extremely high. In some
materials the SmC$_{A}^{\star}$ phase is the only stable tilted smectic phase
in the pure sample. In the scope of the presented model this high sensitivity
of the phase sequence in the AFLCs to optical purity is attributed to the
piezoelectric coupling which is reduced if optical purity is reduced. We limit
our study to three topologically equal phases - SmC$^{*}$, SmC$_{\alpha}^{*}$
and SmC$_{A}^{*}$ and show that the reduction of optical purity forces the
system from the antiferroelectric to the ferroelectric phase with a possible
SmC$_{\alpha}^{\star}$ between them. The effect of the flexoelectric and
quadrupolar coupling is considered as well. If the phase diagram includes only
two phases, SmC$^{\star}$ and SmC$%_{A}^{\star}$, the flexoelectric coupling is
very small. The materials which exhibit the SmC$_{\alpha}^{\star}$ in a certain

finally, when temperature is lowered the phase sequence SmA $\to $

oxides start to form. Important steps in this process are the dissociative
adsorption of oxygen at the surface, the incorporation of O atoms into the
surface, the formation of a thin oxidic overlayer and the growth of the once
formed oxide film. For the oxidation process of late transition metals (TM),
recent experimental and theoretical studies provided a quite intriguing
atomic-scale insight: The formed initial oxidic overlayers are not merely few
atomic-layer thin versions of the known bulk oxides, but can exhibit structural
and electronic properties that are quite distinct to the surfaces of both the
corresponding bulk metals and bulk oxides. If such nanometer or even
sub-nanometer surface oxide films are stabilized in applications, new
functionalities not scalable from the known bulk materials could
correspondingly arise. This can be particularly important for oxidation
catalysis, where technologically relevant gas phase conditions are typically
quite oxygen-rich. In such environments surface oxides may even form naturally
in the induction period, and actuate then the reactive steady-state behavior
that has traditionally been ascribed to the metal substrates. Corresponding
aspects are reviewed by focusing on recent progress in the modeling and
understanding of the oxidation behavior of late TMs, using particularly the
late 4d series from Ru to Ag to discuss trends.

experimental design is a redundant geometry optical truss provided by a
long-baseline (100 m) multi-channel stellar optical interferometer placed on

measuring the angles between the two spacecraft and for orbit determination
purposes. The geometric redundancy enables LATOR to measure the departure from

such nonstandard quantum evolution maps on the behavior of the entangled

production of the heavier Higgs bosons, $H^0$ and $A^0$, of the MSSM can probe

showed that associated $t H^\pm$ production in $\gamma\gamma$ collisions can be
used to make an accurate determination of $\tan\beta$ for low and high
$\tan\beta$ by precision measurements of the $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm t +X $

photon processes in which the Higgs bosons are produced via virtual loops.
Precision measurements of the magnitude and phase of the $H\gamma\gamma$

to physics beyond the SM.

both the inflaton and the curvaton contribute to the total curvature
perturbation. The model predicts an isocurvature perturbation too which has
mixed correlation with the adiabatic one. The cold dark matter of the universe
is mostly constituted by axions plus a small amount of lightest sparticles. The
predictions of the model are confronted with the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy
probe and other cosmic microwave background radiation data. We analyze two
representative choices of parameters and derive bounds on the curvaton
contribution to the adiabatic perturbation. We find that, for the choice which
provides the best fitting of the data, the curvaton contribution to the
adiabatic amplitude must be smaller than about 67% (at 95% confidence level).
The best-fit power spectra are dominated by the adiabatic part of the inflaton
contribution. We use Bayesian model comparison to show that this choice of
parameters is disfavored with respect to the pure inflaton scale-invariant case
with odds of 50 to 1. For the second choice of parameters, the adiabatic mode
is dominated by the curvaton, but this choice is strongly disfavored relative
to the pure inflaton scale-invariant case (with odds of 10^7 to 1). We conclude
that in the present framework the perturbations must be dominated by the
adiabatic component from the inflaton.

the one-loop level, the D-terms get corrections only if the gauge group has an
anomalous spectrum, with the anomaly cancelled by a Green-Schwarz mechanism. We
study the local type IIA model of D6-branes at SU(3) angles and show that, as
in field theory, the one-loop correction suffers from a quadratic divergence in
the open string channel. By studying the closed string channel, we show that
this divergence is related to a closed string tadpole, and is cancelled when
the tadpole is cancelled. Next, we study the cosmic strings that arise in the
supersymmetric phases of these systems in light of recent work of Dvali et. al.
In the type IIA intersecting D6-brane examples, we identify the D-term strings
as D4-branes ending on the D6-branes. Finally, we use N=1 dualities to relate
these results to previous work on the FI D-term of heterotic strings.

equations are derived which determine the heat kernel for the Laplace operator
$-a^2\Delta$ in the case of compound media. In each of the media the parameter
$a^2$ acquires a certain constant value. At the interface of the media the
conditions are imposed which demand the continuity of the `temperature' and the
`heat flows'. The integration in the equations is spread out only over the
interface of the media. As a result the dimension of the initial problem is
reduced by 1. The perturbation series for the integral equations derived are
nothing else as the multiple scattering expansions for the relevant heat
kernels. Thus a rigorous derivation of these expansions is given. In the one
dimensional case the integral equations at hand are solved explicitly (Abel
equations) and the exact expressions for the regarding heat kernels are
obtained for diverse matching conditions. Derivation of the asymptotic
expansion of the integrated heat kernel for a compound media is considered by
making use of the perturbation series for the integral equations obtained. The
method proposed is also applicable to the configurations when the same medium
is divided, by a smooth compact surface, into internal and external regions, or
when only the region inside (or outside) this surface is considered with
appropriate boundary conditions.

  http://www.th.physik.uni-bonn.de/People/rohsiepe/k3",,,"BONN-TH-2004-06","hep-th math.AG",,"  When studying mirror symmetry in the context of K3 surfaces, the hyperkaehler
structure of K3 makes the notion of exchanging Kaehler and complex moduli
ambiguous. On the other hand, the metric is not renormalized due to the higher
amount of supersymmetry of the underlying superconformal field theory. Thus one
can define a natural mapping from the classical K3 moduli space to the moduli
space of conformal field theories. Apart from the generalization of mirror
constructions for Calabi-Yau threefolds, there is a formulation of mirror
symmetry in terms of orthogonal lattices and global moduli space arguments. In
many cases both approaches agree perfectly - with a long outstanding exception:
Batyrev's mirror construction for K3 hypersurfaces in toric varieties does not
fit into the lattice picture whenever the Picard group of the K3 surface is not
generated by the pullbacks of the equivariant divisors of the ambient toric
variety. In this case, not even the ranks of the corresponding Picard lattices
add up as expected. In this paper the connection is clarified by refining the
lattice picture. We show (by explicit calculation with a computer) mirror
symmetry for all families of toric K3 hypersurfaces corresponding to dual
reflexive polyhedra, including the formerly problematic cases.

x^m. Then sigma_K (x) and sigma_int(K) (x) are rational functions which satisfy
the identity sigma_K (1/x) = (-1)^d sigma_int(K) (x). A corollary of Stanley's
theorem is the Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity theorem for the lattice-point
enumerator of rational polytopes. A distinguishing feature of our proof is that
it uses neither the shelling of a polyhedron nor the concept of finite additive
measures. The proof follows from elementary techniques in contour integration.

Analogous constructions of the algebras U and A exist in the case of Lie

  by Jesper Luetzen",,,,"math.HO math-ph math.MP",,"  During the ``long decade'' of transformation of mathematical physics between
1915 and 1930, H. Weyl interacted with physics in two highly productive phases
and contributed to it, among others, by his widely read book on {\em Space -
Time - Matter (Raum Zeit - Materie)} (1918 -- 1923) and on {\em Group Theory
and Quantum Mechanics (Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik)} (1928 - 1931). In
this time Weyl's understanding of the constitution of matter and its
mathematical description changed considerably. At the beginning of the period
he started from a ""dynamistic"" and geometrical conception of matter, following
and extending the Mie-Hilbert approch, which he gave up during the year 1920.
After transitional experiments with a singularity (and in this sense
topological) approach in 1921/22, he developed an open perspective of what he
called an ``agency theory'' of matter. The idea for it was formulated already
before the advent of the ``new'' quantum mechanics in 1925/26. It turned out to
be well suited to be taken over to the quantum view as a kind of ``heritage''
from the first half of the decade. At the end of the period, Weyl completely
renounced his earlier belief in the possibility to ``construct matter'' from a
geometrically unified field theory. He now posed the possibility of a
geometrization of the mathematical forms underlying the rising quantum physical
description of matter as a completely open problem for future research.

the Earth's core, we study the ability to generate a magnetic field when the
flow is permitted to oscillate periodically in time. The flow characteristics
are parameterised by D, representing a differential rotation, M, a meridional
circulation, and C, a component characterising convective rolls. Dynamo action
is sensitive to these flow parameters and fails spectacularly for much of the
parameter space where magnetic flux is concentrated into small regions.
  Oscillations of the flow are introduced by varying the flow parameters in
time, defining a closed orbit in the space (D,M). Time-dependence appears to
smooth out flux concentrations, often enhancing dynamo action. Dynamo action
can be impaired, however, when flux concentrations of opposite signs occur
close together as smoothing destroys the flux by cancellation.
  It is possible to produce geomagnetic-type reversals by making the orbit
stray into a region where the steady flows generate oscillatory fields. In this
case, however, dynamo action was not found to be enhanced by the
time-dependence.
  A novel approach is taken to solving the time-dependent eigenvalue problem,
where by combining Floquet theory with a matrix-free Krylov-subspace method we
avoid large memory requirements for storing the matrix required by the standard
approach.
