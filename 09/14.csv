redshifted Fe Kalpha emission feature in the X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert

to a stable 6.4 keV line, has been reported previously. We find on re-analysing
the XMM-Newton data that the feature varies systematically in flux at intervals
of 25 ks. The peak moves in energy between 5.7 keV and 6.5 keV. The spectral
evolution of the feature agrees with Fe K emission arising from a spot on the
accretion disc, illuminated by a corotating flare located at a radius of (7-16)
rg, modulated by Doppler and gravitational effects as the flare orbits around
the black hole. Combining the orbital timescale and the location of the
orbiting flare, the mass of the black hole is estimated to be (1-5)e+7 Msun,
which is in good agreement with values obtained from other techniques.

involving 40,000 to 100,000 nucleons. The static structure factor describes
coherent neutrino scattering which is expected to dominate the neutrino

small because of ion screening. In contrast, at intermediate momentum transfers
the static structure factor displays a large peak due to coherent scattering
from all the neutrons in a cluster. This peak moves to higher momentum
transfers and decreases in amplitude as the density increases. A large static
structure factor at zero momentum transfer, indicative of large density
fluctuations during a first-order phase transition, may increase the neutrino
opacity. However, no evidence of such an increase has been found. Therefore, it
is unlikely that the system undergoes a simple first-order phase transition. It
is found that corrections to the commonly used single heavy nucleus
approximation first appear at a density of the order of $10^{13}$ g/cm$^3$ and
increase rapidly with increasing density. Thus, neutrino opacities are
overestimated in the single heavy nucleus approximation relative to the

  International Seminar: ""GZK and Surroundings.""",,"10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2004.10.008",,"astro-ph",,"  The process of diffusive acceleration of charged particles in shocked plasmas
is widely invoked in astrophysics to account for the ubiquitous presence of
signatures of non-thermal relativistic electrons and ions in the universe. A
key characteristic of this statistical energization mechanism is the absence of
a momentum scale; astrophysical systems generally only impose scales at the
injection (low energy) and loss (high energy) ends of the particle spectrum.
The existence of structure in the cosmic ray spectrum (the ""knee"") at around
3000 TeV has promoted contentions that there are at least two origins for
cosmic rays, a galactic one supplying those up to the knee, and even beyond,
and perhaps an extragalactic one that can explain even the ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) seen at 1-300 EeV. Accounting for the UHECRs with familiar
astrophysical sites of acceleration has historically proven difficult due to
the need to assume high magnetic fields in order to reduce the shortest
diffusive acceleration timescale, the ion gyroperiod, to meaningful values. Yet
active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts remain strong and interesting candidate
sources for UHECRs, turning the theoretical focus to relativistic shocks. This
review summarizes properties of diffusive shock acceleration that are salient
to the issue of UHECR generation. These include spectral indices, acceleration
efficencies and timescales, as functions of the shock speed and mean field
orientation, and also the nature of the field turbulence. The interpretation of
these characteristics in the context of gamma-ray burst models for the
production of UHECRs is also examined.

sensitivity of ACS enable us to measure weakly distorted, faint background
galaxies to the extent that the number density reaches ~175 arcmin^-2. The PSF
of ACS has a complicated shape that also varies across the field. We construct
a PSF model for ACS from an extensive investigation of 47 Tuc stars in a
modestly crowded region. We show that this model PSF excellently describes the
PSF variation pattern in the cluster observation when a slight adjustment of
ellipticity is applied. The high number density of source galaxies and the
accurate removal of the PSF effect through moment-based deconvolution allow us
to restore the dark matter distribution of the cluster in great detail. The
direct comparison of the mass map with the X-ray morphology from Chandra
observations shows that the two peaks of intracluster medium traced by X-ray
emission are lagging behind the corresponding dark matter clumps, indicative of
an on-going merger. The overall mass profile of the cluster can be well
described by an NFW profile with a scale radius of r_s =309+-45 kpc and a
concentration parameter of c=3.7+-0.5. The mass estimates from the lensing
analysis are consistent with those from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich analyses.
The predicted velocity dispersion is also in good agreement with the
spectroscopic measurement from VLT observations. In the adopted WMAP cosmology,
the total projected mass and the mass-to-light ratio within 1 Mpc are estimated
to be 4.92+-0.44 10^14 solar mass and 95+-8 solar mass/solar luminosity,

increase in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_200/L_B) of isolated galaxies

similar spectral properties when they underwent transitions between the high

in the high gamma-ray intensity state (gamma-2, for Cygnus X-1), their spectra
featured two components: a Comptonized shape below 200-300 keV with a soft
power-law tail (photon index >3) that extended to ~1 MeV or beyond. When the
sources were in the low-intensity state (gamma-0, for Cygnus X-1), the
Comptonized spectral shape below 200 keV typically vanished and the entire
spectrum from 30 keV to ~1 MeV can be characterized by a single power law with
a relatively harder photon index ~2-2.7. Consequently the high- and
low-intensity gamma-ray spectra intersect, generally in the ~400 keV - 1 MeV
range, in contrast to the spectral pivoting seen previously at lower (~10 keV)
energies. The presence of the power-law component in both the high- and

is likely to be at work in both the high and the low-intensity situations. We
have suggested a possible scenario (Ling & Wheaton, 2003), by combining the

non-thermal gamma-ray emission, and which explains the state transitions. Such

that the strong continuum emission is due to electron impact excitation of H2.
The ultimate source of this excitation is likely X-ray irradiation which
creates hot photo-electrons mixed in the molecular layer. Analysis of the SED
of each object finds the presence of inner disk gaps with sizes of a few AU in

evolution between the accretion phase and the zero-age main sequence. At this
stage, the star decouples from its accretion disk, and spins up to a higher

dynamo processes can be expected to become even stronger at this stage. High
energy processes can have effects on the remaining circumstellar material,
possibly including protoplanets and planetesimals, and these effects may
account for certain observable properties of asteroids in the current solar

stage of massive A-type stars. We present first results of the analysis of its
high-resolution X-ray spectrum obtained with the High-Energy Transmission

observed, indicating a continuous emission measure distribution. No significant
signal is detected longward of the O \textsc{viii} Ly$\alpha$ line because of
the high photoelectric absorption. We also report on the preliminary analysis
of the zeroth order spectra of RY Tau and LkCa21. In particular, we show
evidence of an emission line in RY Tau at 6.4 keV that we identify as
fluorescent emission by neutral Fe caused by a strong X-ray flare which
illuminated some structure in (or surrounding) the CTTS. A comparison of X-ray
spectra of classical T Tau stars, other WTTS, and young main-sequence stars is

final catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ), measuring the z-space
correlation function, xi(s). When averaged over the range 0.3<z<2.2 we find
that xi(s) is flat on small scales, steepening on scales above ~25h-1Mpc. In a
WMAP/2dF cosmology we find a best fit power law with s_0=5.48+0.42-0.48h-1Mpc
and gamma=1.20+-0.10 on scales s=1-25h-1Mpc. A CDM model assuming WMAP/2dF
cosmological parameters is a good description of the QSO xi(s) after accounting
for non-linear clustering and z-space distortions, and a linear bias of
b_qso(z=1.35)=2.02+-0.07. We subdivide the 2QZ into 10 redshift intervals from
z=0.53 to 2.48 and find a significant increase in clustering amplitude at high
redshift in the WMAP/2dF cosmology. We derive the bias of the QSOs which is a
strong function of redshift with b_qso(z=0.53)=1.13+-0.18 and
b_qso(z=2.48)=4.24+-0.53. We use these bias values to derive the mean dark
matter halo (DMH) mass occupied by the QSOs. At all redshifts 2QZ QSOs inhabit
approximately the same mass DMHs with M_DH=(3.0+-1.6)x10^12h-1M_sun, which is
close to the characteristic mass in the Press-Schechter mass function, M*, at
z=0. If the relation between black hole (BH) mass and M_DH or host velocity
dispersion does not evolve, then we find that the accretion efficiency
(L/L_edd) for L* QSOs is approximately constant with redshift. Thus the fading
of the QSO population from z~2 to 0 appears to be due to less massive BHs being
active at low redshift. We apply different methods to estimate, t_qso, the
active lifetime of QSOs and constrain this to be in the range 4x10^6-6x10^8
years at z~2. (Abridged).

is dominated by emission from 2 micron amorphous olivine grains. Such grains,
being an order of magnitude larger than those in the interstellar medium, are a
first proof of dust processing and grain growth in disks around brown dwarfs.
The object's spectral energy distribution is below the prediction of the
classical flared disk model but higher than that of the two-layer flat disk. A
good match can be achieved by using an intermediate disk model with strongly
reduced but non-zero flaring. Grain growth and dust settling processes provide
a natural explanation for this disk geometry and we argue that such

different local treatments of convection : the classical mixing-length theory
(MLT hereafter) and Canuto, Goldmann and Mazzitelli(1996, CGM hereafter)'s
formulation. For one set of solar models (EMLT and ECGM models), the atmosphere
is gray and assumes Eddington's approximation. For a second set of models (KMLT

obtained from a Kurucz's model atmosphere computed with the same local
treatment of convection. The mixing-length parameter in the model atmosphere is
chosen so as to provide a good agreement between synthetic and observed Balmer
line profiles, while the mixing-length parameter in the interior model is
calibrated so that the model reproduces the solar radius at solar age. For the
MLT treatment, the rates P do depend significantly on the properties of the
atmosphere. On the other hand, for the CGM treatment, differences in P between
the ECGM and the KCGM models are very small compared to the error bars attached
to the seismic measurements. The excitation rates P for modes from the EMLT

constraints. The KMLT model results in intermediate values for P and shows also
an important discontinuity in the temperature gradient and the convective
velocity. On the other hand, the KCGM model and the ECGM model yield values for
P closer to the seismic data than the EMLT and KMLT models. We conclude that
the solar p-mode excitation rates provide valuable constraints and according to
the present investigation cleary favor the CGM treatment with respect to the

composed of a multiple double-ring system. In the proposed shaping process, one
among several processes through which a companion can shape the circumbinary
gas, the companion accretes mass from the slow wind blown by the evolved mass
losing star. An accretion disk is formed, and if mass accretion is larger than
a critical value, two jets, or a collimated fast wind (CFW) are blown. If the
high mass loss rate duration is long, bipolar lobes are formed. If, on the
other hand, mass loss rate is intermittent, and during one orbital period the
slow wind fills a region which does not extend much beyond the binary system,
then only a fraction of the double-lobe structure is formed, namely, rings.
This, I propose, was the case with the progenitor of the Red Rectangle, where
intermittent episodes of enhanced mass loss rate led to the formation of a

The fine structure lines ratios measured for all the sources can be explained
by photo-ionization with an effective temperature of 32000-37000 K and an
ionization parameter, $U$, of $-1>\log U > -3$. The highest excitation is found
in the Radio Arc region but there must be more ionizing sources distributed
over the Galactic center than the known clusters of massive stars. Most of the
clouds are located far from the prominent continuum complexes (Sgr C, B ...).
However, it is possible that the clouds are ionized by escaped photons from
those complexes. The excitation ratios, effective temperature and ionization
parameter measured in the GC are similar to those found in some low excitation
starburst galaxies. The [NeIII]/[NeII] line ratios measured in the GC sources
are consistent with the results of the Thornely et al. (2000) model for a short
burst of massive star formation less than 8 Myr ago. We have also found that
the [NeII] 13 $\mu$m ~ to far-infrared continuum ratio measured for the GC

absorbed AGN (10^22<NH<10^24 cm^-2) are associated with narrow emission line
galaxies, with red optical colors characteristically dominated by luminous,

a number of atypical AGN; for instance, several luminous AGN show both strong
X-ray absorption (NH>10^22 cm^-2) and broad emission lines. Overall, we find

observations cover phases 360 to 480 days past maximum brightness and include
photometry in the BVRIJH bands, together with a single epoch in each of U and
Ks. While the optical bands decay by about 1.4 mag per 100 days, we find that
the near-IR magnitudes stay virtually constant during the observed period. This
means that the importance of the near-IR to the bolometric light curve
increases with time. The finding is also in agreement with our detailed
modeling of a Type Ia supernova in the nebular phase. In these models, the
increased importance of the near-IR is a temperature effect. We note that this
complicates late-time studies where often only the V band is well monitored. In
particular, it is not correct to assume that any optical band follows the
bolometric light curve at these phases, and any conclusions based on such
assumptions, e.g., regarding positron-escape, must be regarded as premature. A
very simple model where all positrons are trapped can reasonably well account
for the observations. The nickel mass deduced from the positron tail of this

of the fraction of late-time emission that is outside of the observed

successfully modeled by considering magneto-ionic Faraday screens at the
surface of the molecular clouds. Faraday rotated background emission adds to
foreground emission towards these screens in a different way than in its
surroundings. The physical size of the Faraday screens is of the order of 2 pc
for 140 pc distance to the Taurus clouds. Intrinsic rotation measures between
about -18 rad/m2 to -30 rad/m2 are required to model the observations.
Depolarization of the background emission is quite small (compatible with
zero), indicating a regular magnetic field structure with little turbulence
within the Faraday screens. With observational constraints for the thermal
electron density from H-alpha observations of less than 0.8 cm^-3 we conclude
that the regular magnetic field strength along the line of sight exceeds 20
muG. We discuss some possibilities for the origin of such strong and well
ordered magnetic fields. The modeling also predicts a large-scale, regularly
polarized emission in the foreground of the Taurus clouds which is of the order
of 0.24 K at 21cm. This amount of synchrotron emission is clearly excessive

Molecules were produced by sweeping an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate through
a Feshbach resonance. The spectral width of the molecular Bragg resonance
corresponded to an instantaneous temperature of 20 nK, indicating that atomic
coherence was transferred directly to the molecules. An autocorrelating
interference technique was used to observe the quadratic spatial dependence of
the phase of an expanding molecular cloud. Finally, atoms initially prepared in
two momentum states were observed to cross-pair with one another, forming
molecules in a third momentum state. This process is analogous to sum-frequency
generation in optics.

in this way a sufficient number of state nodes in the Tanner graph representing
the codes. We also derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the decoding
complexity of randomly punctured codes on graphs. The bound holds for every

questioned the notion of particle in quantum field theory (QFT). For instance,
uniquely-defined particle states do not exist in general, in QFT on a curved
spacetime. More in general, particle states are difficult to define in a
background-independent quantum theory of gravity. These difficulties have lead
some to suggest that in general QFT should not be interpreted in terms of
particle states, but rather in terms of eigenstates of local operators. Still,
it is not obvious how to reconcile this view with the empirically-observed
ubiquitous particle-like behavior of quantum fields, apparent for instance in
experimental high-energy physics, or ""particle""-physics. Here we offer an
element of clarification by observing that already in flat space there exist
--strictly speaking-- two distinct notions of particles: globally defined
$n$-particle Fock-states and *local particle states*. The last describe the
physical objects detected by finite-size particle detectors and are eigenstates
of local field operators. In the limit in which the particle detectors are
appropriately large, global and local particle states converge in a weak
topology (but not in norm). This observation has little relevance for
flat-space theories --it amounts to a reminder that there are boundary effects
in realistic detectors--; but is relevant for gravity. It reconciles the two
points of view mentioned above. More importantly, it provides a definition of
local particle state that remains well-defined even when the conventional
global particle states are not defined. This definition plays an important role
in quantum gravity.

SO(5) theory of high-T_c superconductivity, while the N=6 model is relevant for
the chiral phase transition in two-color QCD with two flavors. We first
consider the small-field expansion of the effective potential (Helmholtz free
energy). Then, we apply a systematic approximation scheme based on polynomial
parametric representations that are valid in the whole critical regime, satisfy
the correct analytic properties (Griffiths' analyticity), take into account the
Goldstone singularities at the coexistence curve, and match the small-field
expansion of the effective potential. From the approximate representations of
the equation of state, we obtain estimates of universal amplitude ratios. We
also compare our approximate solutions with those obtained in the large-N
expansion, up to order 1/N, finding good agreement for N \gtrsim 32.

localized on the Planck brane can be lowered (or made vanishing) by changing
the localization of the light fermions. If the wave function of the light
fermions is almost flat their coupling to the gauge boson KK modes will be
close to vanishing, and therefore contributions to the S parameter will be
suppressed. At the same time the experimental bounds on such Z' and W' gauge
bosons become very weak, and their masses can be lowered to make sure that
perturbative unitarity is not violated in this theory before reaching energies
of several TeV. The biggest difficulty of these models is to incorporate a
heavy top quark mass without violating any of the experimental bounds on bottom
quark gauge couplings. In the simplest models of fermion masses a sufficiently
heavy top quark also implies an unacceptably large correction to the Zb\bar{b}
vertex and a large splitting between the KK modes of the top and bottom quarks,
yielding large loop corrections to the T-parameter. We present possible
directions for model building where perhaps these constraints could be obeyed

models and approximations. If we are to gain an understanding of the underlying
physics and not just have numerical answers from computing `` black'' boxes, we
must build bridges between the parameter space where models and approximations
are valid to the regime describing experiment, and between the different
modellings of strong dynamics. We describe here how the
Schwinger-Dyson/Bethe-Salpeter approach provides just such a bridge, linking
physics, the lattice and experiment.

different regions in the mass parameter space where massive gravity can be
described by a consistent low-energy effective theory with cutoff
$\sim\sqrt{mM_{Pl}}$ free of rapid instabilities and vDVZ discontinuity. Each
of these regions is characterized by certain fine-tuning relations between mass
parameters, generalizing the Fierz--Pauli condition. In some cases the required
fine-tunings are consequences of the existence of the subgroups of the
diffeomorphism group that are left unbroken by the graviton mass. We found two
new cases, when the resulting theories have a property of UV insensitivity,
i.e. remain well behaved after inclusion of arbitrary higher dimension
operators without assuming any fine-tunings among the coefficients of these
operators, besides those enforced by the symmetries. These theories can be
thought of as generalizations of the ghost condensate model with a smaller
residual symmetry group. We briefly discuss what kind of cosmology can one
expect in massive gravity and argue that the allowed values of the graviton
mass may be quite large, affecting growth of primordial perturbations,
structure formation and, perhaps, enhancing the backreaction of inhomogeneities

solar wind there are still some simple questions which have never been
sufficiently addressed like: a)do we really know how the magnetic field vector
orientation fluctuates in space? b) what is the statistics followed by the
orientation of the vector itself? c) does the statistics change as the wind
expands into the interplanetary space? A better understanding of these points
can help us to better characterize the nature of interplanetary fluctuations
and can provide useful hints to investigators who try to numerically simulate
MHD turbulence. This work follows a recent paper presented by the same authors.
This work follows a recent paper presented by some of the authors which shows
that these fluctuations might resemble a sort of random walk governed by a
Truncated Leevy Flight statistics. However, the limited statistics used in that
paper did not allow final conclusions but only speculative hypotheses. In this
work we aim to address the same problem using a more robust statistics which on
one hand forces us not to consider velocity fluctuations but, on the other hand
allows us to establish the nature of the governing statistics of magnetic
fluctuations with more confidence. In addition, we show how features similar to
those found in the present statistical analysis for the fast speed streams of
solar wind, are qualitatively recovered in numerical simulations of the
parametric instability. This might offer an alternative viewpoint for
interpreting the questions raised above.

corroborate in a consistent way the interpretation of stochastic resonance as a

that a protein can gain extra robustness to the first few substitutions by
increasing its thermodynamic stability. We validate our theory with simulations
on lattice protein models and by showing that it quantitatively predicts
previously published experimental measurements on subtilisin and our own
measurements on variants of TEM1 beta-lactamase. Our work unifies observations
about the clustering of functional proteins in sequence space, and provides a

lattice. For states that are an equal superposition of elements of a group $G$
of spin flips acting on the fully polarized state $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$, we
find that the von Neumann entropy depends only on the boundary between the two
subsystems $A$ and $B$. These states are stabilized by the group $G$. A
physical realization of such states is given by the ground state manifold of
the Kitaev's model on a Riemann surface of genus $\mathfrak{g}$. For a square
lattice, we find that the entropy of entanglement is bounded from above and
below by functions linear in the perimeter of the subsystem $A$ and is equal to
the perimeter (up to an additive constant) when $A$ is convex. The entropy of
entanglement is shown to be related to the topological order of this model.
Finally, we find that some of the ground states are absolutely entangled, i.e.,
no partition has zero entanglement. We also provide several examples for the
square lattice.

posed by reducing the size of the metallic dot to the few donor regime.

universal composability theorem for the quantum setting. We first derive a
composable security definition for QKD. We then prove that the usual security
definition of QKD still implies the composable security definition. Thus, a key
produced in any QKD protocol that is unconditionally secure in the usual
definition can indeed be safely used, a property of QKD that is hitherto
unproven. We propose two other useful sufficient conditions for composability.
As a simple application of our result, we show that keys generated by repeated
runs of QKD degrade slowly.

One exception is in the realm of Statistical Physics, where the calculation of

this talk we shall show that one approach is via the normal ordering of the
second quantized operators appearing in the partition function. This in turn
leads to a combinatorial graphical description, giving essentially Feynman-type
graphs associated with the theory. We illustrate this methodology by the
explicit calculation of two model examples, the free boson gas and a superfluid
boson model. We show how the calculation of partition functions can be
facilitated by knowledge of the combinatorics of the boson normal ordering
problem; this naturally gives rise to the Bell numbers of combinatorics. The
associated graphical representation of these numbers gives a perturbation
expansion in terms of a sequence of graphs analogous to zero - dimensional
Feynman diagrams.
