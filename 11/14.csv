(2310 Angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails of
four ongoing galaxy mergers. The UV-bright regions are optically faint and are
coincident with HI density enhancements. FUV emission is detected at any
location where the HI surface density exceeds ~2 M_sun pc^{-2}, and is often
detected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. UV luminosities of the
brighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 M_sun to ~10^9 M_sun
in young stars in the tails, and HI luminosities imply similar HI masses.
UV-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as a
few Myr, and in all cases ages < 400Myr. Most of the young stars in the tails
formed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,
and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. Star formation appears to be
older near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from the
parent galaxy. This could be because the star formation occurs progressively
along the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near the
galaxy/tail interface. The youngest stellar concentrations, usually near the
ends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarf
galaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of star
formation.

eV and 0.02 A, respectively. For N > 4, lack of measurements, wide experimental
scatter, and discrepancies among theoretical values are handicaps in reliable
accuracy assessments. The radiative and Auger rates are expected to be accurate
to 10% and 20%, respectively, except for transitions involving strongly mixed
levels. Radiative and Auger dampings have been taken into account in the
calculation of photoabsorption cross sections in the K-threshold region,
leading to overlapping lorentzian shaped resonances of constant widths that
cause edge smearing. The behavior of the improved opacities in this region has
been studied with the XSTAR modelling code using simple constant density slab
models, and is displayed for a range of ionization parameters.

the progenitors is small, the remnants structurally and kinematically resemble
elliptical galaxies, in agreement with earlier work. However, if the progenitor
disks are gas-dominated, new types of outcomes are possible. In fact, we show
that a prominent disk may survive in certain cases. To illustrate this
scenario, we analyze an extreme example with progenitor galaxies consisting of
dark matter halos, pure gas disks, and no bulges, as might be appropriate for
mergers at high redshifts. While rapid star formation triggered by tidal
torques during the merger forms a central, rotating bulge in the remnant, not
all the gas is consumed in the burst. The remaining gas cools very quickly and
settles into an extended star-forming disk, yielding an object similar to a
spiral galaxy, and not an early type galaxy. This is contrary to the usual view
that major mergers invariably destroy disks. The morphological evolution of
galaxies can therefore be more complicated than often assumed, and in
particular, theoretical constraints based on the fragility of spiral disks need
to be reevaluated.

Using a generating function formalism we solve the generalized optical Bloch
equations, and obtain an exact analytical formula for the line shape and
Mandel's Q parameter. The line shape exhibits well known behaviors, including
motional narrowing when the stochastic modulation is fast, and power
broadening. The Mandel parameter, describing the line shape fluctuations,
exhibits a transition from a Quantum sub-Poissonian behavior in the fast
modulation limit, to a classical super-Poissonian behavior found in the slow
modulation limit. Our result is applicable for weak and strong laser field,
namely for arbitrary Rabi frequency. We show how to choose the Rabi frequency
in such a way that the Quantum sub-Poissonian nature of the emission process
becomes strongest. A lower bound on $Q$ is found, and simple limiting behaviors
are investigated. A non-trivial behavior is obtained in the intermediate
modulation limit, when the time scales for spectral diffusion and the life time
of the excited state, become similar. A comparison is made between our results,
and previous ones derived based on the semi-classical generalized

between the concepts of Moufang loops and groups with triality.

  B?","9 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  General relativity predicts a ""hyperfine"" precession rate for a gyroscope
moving in the gravitomagnetic field of a rotating massive body. The recently
launched Gravity Probe B (GP-B) will test the predicted precession rate of 40.9
milliarc-seconds per year for a set of four gyroscopes in a Polar Earth Orbit
(PEO). It may be possible, however, that the gravitomagnetic field from a
rotating mass behaves in the same way as the magnetic field generated by a
moving charge. In that case the predicted precession rate of a gyroscope will
be zero, since the gyroscopes of GP-B have been shielded against external
magnetic fields. Another possible manifestation of the equivalence of
gravitomagnetic and magnetic field may already have been found. It is the
so-called Wilson Blackett law, approximately describing the magnetic field of
many rotating celestial bodies. In this work a review of the gravitomagnetic
approach is given starting from the Einstein equations. Four gravitomagnetic
equations, analogous to the Maxwell equations, are deduced. The Wilson Blackett
relation follows from these equations, if the gravitomagnetic field is
identified as a common magnetic field. In addition, the precession rate for a
gyroscope in terms of the gravito-magnetic field has been derived, starting
from the principle of general covariance. The gravitomagnetic field may again
be identified as a common magnetic field, or can be evaluated in the standard
way. The future observations from GP-B may discriminate between the alternative
choices.

achieving proper neuronal function in several parts of the nervous system of

neuronal cells, particularly the ganglion cells, in mammal's retina is required
in order to properly sample the projected scene. This work presents how two
concepts from the areas of statistical mechanics and complex systems, namely
the \emph{lacunarity} and the \emph{multiscale entropy} (i.e. the entropy
calculated over progressively diffused representations of the cell mosaic),
have allowed effective characterization of the spatial distribution of retinal
cells.

CSs namely the {\it family of dual states} associated with theses states can be
constructed through viewing these states as {\it temporally stable nonlinear
CSs}. Also we find that the ladder operators, as well as the displacement type
operator corresponding to these two pairs of generalized CSs, may be easily
obtained using our formalism, without employing the {\it supersymmetric quantum
mechanics}(SUSYQM) techniques. Then, we have applied this method to some
physical systems with known spectrum, such as P\""{o}schl-Teller, infinite well,
Morse potential and Hydrogen-like spectrum as some quantum mechanical systems.
Finally, we propose the generalized form of Gazeau-Klauder CS and the
corresponding dual family.
