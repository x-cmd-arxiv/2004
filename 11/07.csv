towards four high-mass star forming regions (Sh 2-255 IR, IRAS 23139+5939,
WB89-234, and OMC2). The (three) observing epochs span a time range of 6
months. In each region, the water maser emission likely originates close
(within a few hundreds of AU) to a forming high-mass YSO. Several maser
features (~10) have been detected for each source and, for those features
persistent over the three epochs, proper motions have been derived. The
amplitudes of the proper motions are found to be larger than the range of
variation of the line-of-sight velocities and in each of the observed sources
the proper motion orientation seems to indicate an expansion motion.
  The gas kinematics traced by the 22.2 GHz water masers is compatible with the
shock-excited nature of water maser emission.
  Three different kinematic models (a spherical expanding shell, a Keplerian
rotating disk, and a conical outflow) were fitted to the 3-dimensional velocity
field of the detected maser features. The results of these fits, together with
the comparison of the VLBI maps with the highest-resolution images of the
sources in several thermal tracers, suggest that the water maser features are
most likely tracing the inner portion of the molecular outflows detected at
much larger-scales.

lead to very inhomogeneous local sensitivity of the price to space weather
conditions. It is noted that ""soft type"" models are the most adequate for
description of this class of connections. Two main observational effects
suitable for testing causal connections of this type of sensitivity are
considered: burst-like price reactions on changes in solar activity and price
asymmetry for selected phases of the sunspot cycle. The connection, discovered
earlier for wheat prices of Medieval England, is examined in this work on the
basis of another 700-year data set of consumable prices in England. Using the
same technique as in the previous part of our work (Pistilnik and Yom Din 2004)
we show that statistical parameters of the interval distributions for price
bursts of consumables basket and for sunspot minimum states are similar one to
another, like it was reported earlier for wheat price bursts. Possible sources
of these consistencies between three different multiyear samples are discussed.
For search of possible manifestations of the ""space weather - wheat market""

which a lens consists of a smooth potential and small mass clumps
(``substructure lensing''). We first consider a lens model that consists of a
clump modeled as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a primary lens modeled
as an external background shear and convergence. For this simple model, we
derive analytic formulae for (de)magnification of circularly symmetric top-hat
sources with three types of parity for their lensed images, namely, positive,
negative, and doubly negative parities. Provided that the source size is
sufficiently larger than the Einstein radius of the SIS, we find that in the
positive (doubly negative) parity case, an extended source is always magnified
(demagnified) in comparison with the unperturbed macrolens system, whereas in
the negative parity case, the (de)magnification effect, which depends on the
sign of convergence minus unity is weaker than those in other parities. It is
shown that a measurement of the distortion pattern in a multiply lensed image
enables us to break the degeneracy between the lensing effects of clump mass
and those of clump distance if lensing parameters of the relevant macrolens
model are determined from the position and flux of multiple images. We also
show that an actual density profile of a clump can be directly measured by
analyzing the ``fine structure'' in a multiply lensed image within the Einstein
radius of the clump.

a commonly known baseband, discrete-time multiple antenna system where both the
transmitter and receiver know the channel's statistical law. We analyze the
capacity for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, fading channels
with full channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, fading channels with
no CSI, and fading channels with partial CSI at the receiver. For each type of
channels, we study the capacity value as well as issues such as the existence,
uniqueness, and characterization of the capacity-achieving measures for
different types of moment constraints. The results are applicable to both
Rayleigh and Rician fading channels in the presence of arbitrary line-of-sight
and correlation profiles.

of Kolmogorov complexity. Special attention is paid to the canonical
rate-distortion function of a source word which returns the minimal Kolmogorov
complexity of all distortion balls containing that word subject to a bound on
their cardinality. This canonical rate-distortion function is related to the
more standard algorithmic rate-distortion function for the given distortion
measure. Examples are given of list distortion, Hamming distortion, and
Euclidean distortion. The algorithmic rate-distortion function can behave
differently from Shannon's rate-distortion function. To this end, we show that
the canonical rate-distortion function can and does assume a wide class of
shapes (unlike Shannon's); we relate low algorithmic mutual information to low
Kolmogorov complexity (and consequently suggest that certain aspects of the
mutual information formulation of Shannon's rate-distortion function behave
differently than would an analogous formulation using algorithmic mutual
information); we explore the notion that low Kolmogorov complexity distortion
balls containing a given word capture the interesting properties of that word
(which is hard to formalize in Shannon's theory) and this suggests an approach
to denoising; and, finally, we show that the different behavior of the
rate-distortion curves of individual source words to some extent disappears
after averaging over the source words.

observables to construct Dirac observables for constrained systems to the
general case of an arbitrary first class constraint algebra with structure
functions rather than structure constants. Here we use this framework and
propose a new way for how to implement explicitly a reduced phase space
quantization of a given system, at least in principle, without the need to
compute the gauge equivalence classes. The degree of practicality of this
programme depends on the choice of the partial observables involved. The
(multi-fingered) time evolution was shown to correspond to an automorphism on
the set of Dirac observables so generated and interesting representations of
the latter will be those for which a suitable preferred subgroup is realized
unitarily. We sketch how such a programme might look like for General
Relativity. We also observe that the ideas by Dittrich can be used in order to
generate constraints equivalent to those of the Hamiltonian constraints for
General Relativity such that they are spatially diffeomorphism invariant. This
has the important consequence that one can now quantize the new Hamiltonian
constraints on the partially reduced Hilbert space of spatially diffeomorphism
invariant states, just as for the recently proposed Master constraint
programme.

quantization procedure suggested by Loop Quantum Gravity and based on an
alternative to the Schroedinger representation introduced by H. Halvorson.
Through this quantization procedure we show that the inverse of the volume
density and the Schwarzschild curvature invariant are upper bounded and so the
space time is singularity free. Also in this case we can extend dynamically the
space time beyond the classical singularity.

  Plasma Drifts and Magnetic Flux Convection close to the Earth","Preprint submitted to journal, 11 pages of text, 4 diagrams",,,,"physics.space-ph",,"  Convection inside the magnetosphere can be regarded as the transfer of
magnetic flux and plasma from the magnetotail into the nightside and then
convection and drift from there to the dayside. As in many fluid flow
situations, the downstream flow (the convection and drift to the dayside) is an
important boundary condition for the upstream flow (reconnection and inflow
from the tail). Tail-like flux tubes in the near-earth plasma sheet block
inflow from the tail between reconnection events. However, the westward drift
of the energetic ions (curvature and gradient drift and ExB drift) removes
plasma energy from near midnight causing deflation and earthward flow in the
equatorial plane. (The process can be described as the westward drift of the
eastern of the plasma sheet / partial ring current.) The earthward flow removes
magnetic flux and plasma from the center of the thick plasma sheet and creates
a thin current sheet, which, in turn, favors the onset of reconnection. The X
line forms just tailward of the earthward-flow region. Initially, reconnection
occurs by the earthward propagation of the X line and the growth of a magnetic
island on its tailward side, since there is no downtail flow. Subsequently, the
system evolves towards lobe merging, and the X line propagates tailward
consistent with the standard picture of tail reconnection. The east-west width
of the local-time slot in which inflow and reconnection occur is determined by
the scale-length of the decrease in plasma energy at the eastern end of the
drifting ions. It is expected that the reconnection slot follows the westward
drift of the eastern end of the partial ring current. The model appears to be
consistent with bursty bulk flows, the westward traveling surge and many other
observed properties of substorms.

magnetic field and a secondary, low amplitude, wave is launched
perpendicularly. The effect of both the launching angle of the primary wave,
and the presence of the secondary wave is investigated. Theoretical predictions
of the highest performances of the three-dimensional (3D) configurations are
proposed using a Resonance Moments Method (RMM) based on estimates for the
moments of the velocity distribution function calculated inside the resonance
layers (RL). They suggest the existence of an optimal angle corresponding to
non parallel launching. Direct statistical simulations show that it is possible
to rise the mean electron velocity up to the order of magnitude as compared to
the primary wave launching alone. It is a quite promising result because the
amplitude of the secondary wave is ten times lower the one of the first wave.
The parameters used are related to magnetic plasma fusion experiments in
electron cyclotron resonance heating and electron acceleration in planetary
ionospheres and magnetospheres.

to be diversified which reflects sensitivity of the kinetics to the details of
native structures. The Go-like model corresponding to the experimentally
resolved native structure of the I1 domain is found to provide the biggest
thermodynamic and mechanical stability compared to the other domains studied
here. We analyze elastic, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of several
structures corresponding to the I28 domain as obtained through homology-based
modeling. We discuss the ability of the models of the I28 domain to reproduce
experimental results qualitatively. A strengthening of contacts that involve
hydrophobic amino acids does not affect theoretical comparisons of the domains.
Tandem linkages of up to five identical or different domains unravel in a
