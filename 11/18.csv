by the synchrotron self-Compton process. Instead we consider two possible
sources of the hard emission: the outer arcs may be due to thermal radiation of
hot intracluster gas compressed at the bow shock. Alternatively, both outer and
inner arcs may be due to synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated in
turbulent regions highly perturbed by shocks and shear flows. Comparison of
measured hardness ratios with simulations of the hardness ratios resulting from
these processes show that it is more diffcult to explain the observations with
a thermal model. Although we cannot rule out a thermal model, we argue in
favour of the non-thermal explanation. The hard regions in the secondary
hotspots suggest that jet activity is still powering these hotspots.

effects drive the dynamics of an ultrashort orbital period X-ray binary
embracing a high-mass donor white dwarf (WD) to a rapidly rotating low
magnetised massive neutron star (NS) surrounded by a thick, dense and massive
accretion torus. Driven by GR reaction, sparsely, the binary separation
reduces, the WD overflows its Roche lobe and the mass transfer drives unstable
the accretion disk around the NS. As the binary circular orbital period is a
multiple integer number ($m$) of the period of the WD fundamental mode (Pons et
al. 2002), the WD is since long pulsating at its fundamental mode; and most of
its harmonics, due to the tidal interaction with its NS orbital companion.
Hence, when the powerful irradiation glows onto the WD; from the fireball
ejected as part of the disk matter slumps onto the NS, it is partially
absorbed. This huge energy excites other WD radial ($p$-mode) pulsations
(Podsiadlowski 1991,1995). After each mass-transfer episode the binary
separation (and orbital period) is augmented significantly (Deloye & Bildsten
2003; Al\'ecyan & Morsink 2004) due to the binary's angular momentum
redistribution. Thus a new adiabatic inspiral phase driven by GR reaction
starts which brings the binary close again, and the process repeats. This model
allows to explain most of SGRs observational features: their recurrent
activity, energetics of giant superoutbursts and quiescent stages, and
particularly the intriguing subpulses discovered by BeppoSAX (Feroci et al.
1999), which are suggested here to be {\it overtones} of the WD radial
fundamental mode (see the accompanying paper: Mosquera Cuesta 2004b).

explanation in the context of the competing theories to explain the SGRs
phenomenology: the magnetar and accretion-driven models. Based on the
ultra-relativistic, ultracompact X-ray binary model introduced in the
accompanying paper (Mosquera Cuesta 2004a), I present here a self-consistent
explanation for such an striking feature. I suggest that both the fundamental
mode and the overtones observed in SGR1900+14 stem from pulsations of a massive
white dwarf (WD). The fundamental mode (and likely some of its harmonics) is
excited because of the mutual gravitational interaction with its orbital
companion (a NS, envisioned here as point mass object) whenever the binary
Keplerian orbital frequency is a multiple integer number ($m$) of that mode
frequency (Pons et al. 2002). Besides, a large part of the powerful irradiation
from the fireball-like explosion occurring on the NS (after partial accretion
of disk material) is absorbed in different regions of the star driving the
excitation of other multipoles (Podsiadlowski 1991,1995), i.e., the overtones
(fluid modes of higher frequency). Part of this energy is then reemitted into
space from the WD surface or atmosphere. This way, the WD lightcurve carries
with it the signature of these pulsations inasmuch the way as it happens with
the Sun pulsations in Helioseismology. It is shown that our theoretical
prediction on the pulsation spectrum agrees quite well with the one found by
BeppoSAX (Feroci et al. 1999). A feature confirmed by numerical simulations
(Montgomery & Winget 2000).

success of the CDM theory. At lower mass scales, the simulations predict a
large abundance of small substructures below our detection threshold with

performed with the ACS onboard the HST in the F606W, F775W and F850LP passbands
and extensive spectroscopic data obtained with the Keck LRIS. Our main results
are based on a spectroscopically selected sample of 143 cluster members with
morphological classifications derived from the ACS observations. Our three
primary findings are (1) the faint-end slope of the LF is steepest in the
bluest filter, (2) the LF in the inner part of the cluster (or highest density
regions) has a flatter faint-end slope, and (3) the fraction of early-type
galaxies is higher at the bright end of the LF, and gradually decreases toward
fainter magnitudes. These characteristics are consistent with those in local
galaxy clusters, indicating that, at least in massive clusters, the common
characteristics of cluster LFs are established at z=0.83. We also find a 2sigma
deficit of intrinsically faint, red galaxies (i-z>0.5, Mi>-19) in this cluster.
This trend may suggest that faint, red galaxies (which are common in z<0.1 rich
clusters) have not yet been created in this cluster at z=0.83. The
giant-to-dwarf ratio in MS1054-0321 starts to increase inwards of the virial
radius or when Sigma>30 Mpc^-2, coinciding with the environment where the
galaxy star formation rate and the morphology-density relation start to appear.

such as the Butcher-Oemler effect and the decrease in S0 fraction with
increasing redshift. As a modern version, the redshift evolution of total star
formation rate (SFR) in clusters has been actively debated recently. However,
these studies of redshift trend have been always hampered by the possible mass
dependence; due to the observational selection effects, clusters found at
higher redshift inevitably tend to be more massive and luminous than local
counterparts. Consequently, one has to correct for the mass trend before
interpreting the redshift trend.
  As an attempt to break this degeneracy, we investigate the mass dependence of
blue/late-type fractions and total SFR of 115 clusters at $z\leq 0.09$ selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that none of blue/late-type
fractions, total SFR and total SFR normalized by cluster mass shows significant
dependence on cluster virial mass. The scatter is much larger at each cluster
mass than a possible trend. Our results indicates that physical mechanisms that
depend on cluster mass (such as the ram-pressure stripping) are not likely to
be solely responsible for cluster galaxy evolution. Our results also provide an
excellent low redshift comparison sample for future high redshift cluster SFR

lines but without any [OII] or Halpha emission lines. Strong Balmer absorption
lines indicate that E+A galaxies have experienced a starburst within the last
<1-1.5 Gyr. However, the lack of emission lines indicates that E+A galaxies do
not have any on-going star formation. Therefore, E+A galaxies are interpreted
as a post-starburst galaxy. However, it has been a mystery why E+A galaxies
underwent a starburst then stopped abruptly.
  One possible explanation to E+A galaxies is the dusty starburst scenario,
where E+A galaxies have on-going star formation, but optical emission lines are
invisible due to the heavy obscuration by dust. To test this dusty starburst
scenario, we have observed 36 E+A galaxies carefully selected from the SDSS DR1
in 20cm radio continuum using the VLA. Since the radio emission is not affected
by the dust extinction, the SFR in dusty galaxies can be revealed by the 20 cm
continuum. All of our 36 target E+A galaxies are selected to have H\delta EW
greater than 6A and no detection of [OII] or Halpha emission lines within 1
sigma. These selection criteria are much stronger than previous E+A selections
in our attempt to select galaxies in the pure post-starburst phase without any
remaining star formation. Except for the two galaxies with a nearby radio
source, none of our 34 E+A galaxies are detected in 20 cm continuum to the
limits reported in Table 1. The obtained upper limits on the radio estimated
SFR suggest that E+A galaxies do not possess strong starburst (> 100 Msun
yr^-1) hidden by dust extinction for the whole sample while 15 (z<0.08) E+As
have lower SFR upper limits of ~15 Msun yr^-1. (Abridged)

compared. It is found that the mass spectrum of GMCs varies from galaxy to
galaxy. The variations are significant and do not appear to be the result of
systematic uncertainties. Nevertheless, it appears that all of the GMCs follow
the same size-linewidth and mass-linewidth relations with little scatter. The
power law indices of these relations imply that the GMCs are self-gravitating,
and that the mean surface density of Local Group GMCs is approximately
constant. This, in turn, implies that the mean internal pressure of GMCs is
also constant. If the IMF of stars is determined by a Jeans instability, this
constant internal pressure suggests that the distribution of stellar masses
does not vary significantly in galactic disks when averaged over suitably large
areas. Thus, although the distribution of GMC masses produced by various Local
Group galaxies is quite variable, the large-scale properties of the GMCs is
not.

Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph observations of the low-mass
pre-main sequence star CoKu Tau/4. We have modeled the mid-IR spectrum (between
8 and 25 mic) as arising from the inner wall of a disk. Our model disk has an
evacuated inner zone of radius ~ 10 AU, with a dusty inner ``wall'', of
half-height ~ 2 AU, that is illuminated at normal incidence by the central
star. The radiative equilibrium temperature decreases from the inner disk edge
outward through the optically-thick disk; this temperature gradient is
responsible for the emission of the silicate bands at 10 and 20 mic. The
observed spectrum is consistent with being produced by Fe-Mg amorphous glassy
olivine and/or pyroxene, with no evidence of a crystalline component. The
mid-infrared spectrum of CoKu Tau/4 is reminiscent of that of the much older
star TW Hya, where it has been suggested that the significant clearing of its
inner disk is due to planet formation. However, no inner disk remains in CoKu
Tau/4, consistent with the star being a weak-emission (non-accreting) T Tauri
star. The relative youth of CoKu Tau/4 (~ 1 Myr) may indicate much more rapid
planet formation than typically assumed.

period and period excess of TV Crv are accurately determined to be 0.065028 +/-
0.000008 d and 0.0342 +/- 0.0021, respectively. This large excess implies a
relatively large mass ratio of the binary components (M_2/M_1), though it has a
short orbital period. The two types of superoutbursts can be explained by the
thermal-tidal instability model for systems having large mass ratios. Our
observations reveal that superhump period derivatives are variable in distinct
superoutbursts. The variation is apparently related to the presence or absence
of a precursor. We propose that the superhump period derivative depends on the
maximum disk radius during outbursts. We investigate the relationship of the
type of superoutbursts and the superhump period derivative for known sources.
In the case of superoutbursts without a precursor, superhump period derivatives
tend to be larger than those in precursor-main type superoutbursts, which is
consistent with our scenario.

thorough analysis of the properties of the X-ray gas in the cluster itself,

results show that Abell 85 had intense merging activity in the past and is not
fully relaxed, even in the central region. We have also determined the
individual abundances for some iron-group metals and alpha-elements in various

Spectral analysis of the central region suggests a different redshift of the
X-ray emitting gas compared to the mean cluster velocity derived from galaxy
member redshifts. We discuss the implications of the difference between the cD
galaxy redshift, the mean galaxy redshift and the hot gas redshift, as well as
the possibility of several groups being accreted on to Abell 85. Finally, we
obtain the dynamical mass profile and baryon fraction taking into account the

compared the M- and L-dwarf populations finding evidence for a larger frequency
of high I-band polarization in the coolest objects, supporting the presence of
significant amounts of dust in L-dwarfs. The probable polarizing mechanism is
related to the presence of heterogeneous dust clouds nonuniformly distributed
across the visible photospheres and the asymmetric shape of the objects. In
some young ultracool dwarfs, surrounding dusty disks may also yield
polarization. For polarimetric detections, a trend for slightly larger
polarization from L0 to L6.5 may be present in our data, suggesting changes in
the distribution of the grain properties, vertical height of the clouds,
metallicity, age, and rotation speed. One of our targets is the peculiar brown

Approximately 60 per cent of the population can be classified as X-ray binaries
(XRBs), although there is source contamination from background AGN in this
category as they have similar spectral shapes in the X-ray regime. Fifteen
sources have X-ray colours consistent with supernova remnants (SNRs), three of
which correlate with known SNR/HII radio sources. We also detect 14 candidate
supersoft sources, with significant detections in the softest X-ray band (0.3-1
keV) only. Sixteen sources display short-term variability during the XMM-Newton
observation, twelve of which fall into the XRB category, giving additional
evidence of their accreting nature. Using archival Chandra & ROSAT HRI data, we
find that ~40 per cent of the XMM sources show long-term variability over a
baseline of up to ~10 years, and eight sources display potential transient
behaviour between observations. Sources with significant flux variations
between the XMM and Chandra observations show a mixture of softening and
hardening with increasing luminosity. The spectral and timing properties of the

The mass-to-light ratio in the SDSS i band clearly increases with the cluster
mass with a slope 0.2\pm0.08. The optical and X-ray luminosities correlate in
excellent way with both T_X and \sigma_V with an orthogonal scatter of 20% in
both relations. Moreover, L_{op} and L_X can predict with the same accuracy
both variables. We conclude that the cluster optical luminosity is a key
cluster parameter since it can give important information about fundamental
cluster properties such as the mass, the velocity dispersion, and the
temperature of the intra-cluster medium.

  2004",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Optical/near-IR broadband photometry of the halos of blue compact galaxies
(BCGs) have revealed a very red spectral energy distribution, which cannot
easily be reconciled with any normal, metal-poor stellar population. Here,
three possible explanations for the red excess are explored: nebular emission,
metal-rich stars and a stellar population with a very bottom-heavy initial mass
function (IMF). We find, that nebular emission in BCG halos would produce very
blue near-IR colours, and hence fails to explain the observed red excess.
Although metal-rich stars may in principle explain the colours observed, the
required stellar metallicity is very high (solar or higher), which would be a
curious halo property given the low gas metallicity (~10% solar) of the central
starburst in these objects. A stellar population with a low to intermediate
metallicity and a very bottom-heavy IMF does however adequately reproduce the
observed BCG halo colours. A bottom-heavy IMF also proves successful in
explaining a similar red excess observed in the halos of stacked edge-on disk
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This may indicate that halos
dominated by low-mass stars is a phenomenon common to galaxies of very
different Hubble types.

question. In this contribution, we confront Eggen's hypothesis that they are
cluster remnants with the results of a kinematic analysis of more than 6000 K
and M giants in the solar neighbourhood. This analysis includes new radial
velocity data from a large survey performed with the Coravel spectrometer,
complemented by Hipparcos parallaxes and Tycho-2 proper motions (Famaey et al.
2004). A maximum-likelihood method, based on a bayesian approach, has been
applied to the data, in order to make full use of all the available data
(including less precise parallaxes) and to derive the properties of the
different kinematic subgroups. Two such subgroups can be identified with the
Hyades and Sirius superclusters. Stars belonging to them span a very wide range
of age, which is difficult to account for in Eggen's scenario. These groups are
thus most probably ""dynamical streams"" related to the dynamical perturbation by
spiral waves rather than to cluster remnants.
  In this scenario, the Hyades and Ursa Major clusters just happen to be in the
Hyades and Sirius streams, which are purely dynamical features that have
nothing to do with the remnants of more massive primordial clusters. This
mechanism could be the key to understanding the presence of an old metal-rich
population, and of many exoplanetary systems in our neighbourhood. Moreover, a
strong spiral pattern seems to be needed in order to yield such prominent
streams. Since spiral structure is usually baryonic, this would leave very
little room for dark matter. This may be an indication that the era of the
dark-matter paradigm explaining the dynamics of the Galaxy may come to an end,
and is being superseded by modified gravity.

important clues to the construction of realistic stellar dynamical models of

anisotropic envelopes), is a prerequisite to more ambitious attempts at
constructing physically justified models of elliptical galaxies in which the
problem of galaxy formation is set in the generally accepted cosmological
context of hierarchical clustering.
  In a previous paper, we have discussed the dynamical properties of a family
of models of partially relaxed stellar systems (the f^{(\nu)} models), designed
to incorporate the qualitative properties of the products of collisionless
collapse at small and at large radii. Here we revisit the problem of incomplete
violent relaxation, by making a direct comparison between the detailed
properties of such family of models and those of the products of collisionless
collapse found in N-body simulations that we have run for the purpose.
Surprisingly, the models thus identified are able to match the simulated
density distributions over nine orders of magnitude and also to provide an
excellent fit to the anisotropy profiles and a good representation of the

to weakly couple to the QD region. Our theory is formulated by second
quantizing the Rashba spin-orbital interaction in spectral space (instead of
real space), and quantum transport is then analyzed within the Keldysh
nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. The Rashba interaction causes two
main effects to the Hamiltonian: (i) it gives rise to an extra spin-dependent
phase factor in the coupling matrix elements between the leads and the QD; (ii)
it gives rise to an inter-level spin-flip term but forbids any intra-level

investigate transport properties of a Aharnov-Bohm ring in which a QD having

substantial spin-polarized conductance or current emerges in this device due to
a combined effect of a magnetic flux and the Rashba interaction. The direction

p. 1075 (2004)) has shown that, unexpectedly, the same is not true for
particles orbiting black holes: for Kerr black holes with the spin parameter
$a>0.9953$, the velocity has a positive radial gradient for geodesic, stable,
circular orbits in a small radial range close to the black hole horizon. We
show here that the {\em Aschenbach effect} occurs also for non-geodesic
circular orbits with constant specific angular momentum $\ell = \ell_0 =

radius. The equivelocity surfaces coincide with the $R = const$ surfaces which,
of course, are just co-axial cylinders. It was previously known that in the
black hole case this simple topology changes because one of the ``cylinders''
self-crosses. We show here that the Aschenbach effect is connected to a second
topology change that for the $\ell = const$ tori occurs only for very highly

Dipole Moment(EDM). To guide emerging searches for EDMs with molecular ions, we
estimate the EDM-induced energy corrections for hydrogen halide ions
$\mathrm{HBr}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{HI}^{+}$ in their respective ground $X
^2\Pi_{3/2}$ states. We find that the energy corrections due to EDM for the two
ions differ by an unexpectedly large factor of fifteen. We demonstrate that a
major part of this enhancement is due to a dissimilarity in the nature of the
chemical bond for the two ions: the bond that is nearly of ionic character in
$\mathrm{HBr}^{+}$ exhibits predominantly covalent nature in $\mathrm{HI}^{+}$.
We conclude that because of this enhancement the HI$^+$ ion may be a
potentially competitive candidate for the EDM search.

theory is then compactified, and the effective D=4 lagrangian is derived using
lattice techniques, or ``deconstruction,'' where pseudoscalar mesons arise from
the lattice Wilson links. This yields the WZW term with the correct Witten
coefficient by way of a simple heuristic argument. We discover a novel WZW term
for singlet currents, that yields the full Goldstone-Wilczek current, and a
U(1) axial current for the skyrmion, with the appropriate anomaly structures. A
more detailed analysis is presented of the dimensional compactification of
Yang-Mills in D=5 into a gauged chiral lagrangian in D=4, heeding the
consistency of the D=4 and D=5 Bianchi identities. These dictate a novel
covariant derivative structure in the D=4 gauge theory, yielding a field
strength modified by the addition of commutators of chiral currents. The
Chern-Simons term of the pure D=5 Yang-Mills theory then devolves into the
correct form of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term with an index (the analogue of

of possible decompositions of quantum systems into independent parts. For
quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom the simplest
possibility, i.e., factors of type I in the terminology of Murray and von
Neumann, are perfectly adequate. In relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT),
on the other hand, factors of type III occur naturally. The same holds true in
quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems. In this brief review some
physical consequences of the type III property of the von Neumann algebras
corresponding to localized observables in RQFT and their difference from the
type I case will be discussed. The cumulative effort of many people over more
than 30 years has established a remarkable uniqueness result: The local
algebras in RQFT are generically isomorphic to the unique, hyperfinite type
${\rm III}_{1}$ factor in Connes' classification of 1973. Specific theories are
characterized by the net structure of the collection of these isomorphic
algebras for different space-time regions, i.e., the way they are embedded into
each other.

selecting elliptic curves using their order as the primary criterion. We can
formalize this issue by asking whether the discrete log problem (DLOG) has the
same difficulty for all curves over a given finite field with the same order.
We prove that this is essentially true by showing polynomial time random
reducibility of DLOG among such curves, assuming the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis (GRH). We do so by constructing certain expander graphs, similar to
Ramanujan graphs, with elliptic curves as nodes and low degree isogenies as
edges.
  The result is obtained from the rapid mixing of random walks on this graph.
Our proof works only for curves with (nearly) the same endomorphism rings.
Without this technical restriction such a DLOG equivalence might be false;
however, in practice the restriction may be moot, because all known polynomial
time techniques for constructing equal order curves produce only curves with
nearly equal endomorphism rings.

meta-stable states. They are subject to two sources of perturbation: a slow
external periodic perturbation of period $T$ and a small Gaussian random
perturbation of intensity $\epsilon$, and, therefore, are mathematically
described as weakly time inhomogeneous diffusion processes. A system is in
stochastic resonance, provided the small noisy perturbation is tuned in such a
way that its random trajectories follow the exterior periodic motion in an
optimal fashion, that is, for some optimal intensity $\epsilon (T)$. The
physicists' favorite, measures of quality of periodic tuning--and thus
stochastic resonance--such as spectral power amplification or signal-to-noise
ratio, have proven to be defective. They are not robust w.r.t. effective model
reduction, that is, for the passage to a simplified finite state Markov chain
model reducing the dynamics to a pure jumping between the meta-stable states of
the original system. An entirely probabilistic notion of stochastic resonance
based on the transition dynamics between the domains of attraction of the
meta-stable states--and thus failing to suffer from this robustness defect--was
proposed before in the context of one-dimensional diffusions. It is
investigated for higher-dimensional systems here, by using extensions and
refinements of the Freidlin--Wentzell theory of large deviations for time
homogeneous diffusions. Large deviations principles developed for weakly time
inhomogeneous diffusions prove to be key tools for a treatment of the problem
of diffusion exit from a domain and thus for the approach of stochastic
resonance via transition probabilities between meta-stable sets.

estimation of volatility of an asset return process becomes feasible. A major
problem is how to estimate the volatility consistently and efficiently, when

microstructure noise. The former (consistency) has been addressed heavily in
the recent literature, however, the resulting estimator is not quite efficient.

polynomials invariant under certain linear Hamiltonian circle actions. From the
geometry of the polyhedra, various Poisson structures on the orbit spaces of
the actions are derived and Poisson embeddings into model spaces, for the orbit
spaces, are constructed. The Poisson structures, on respective source and model
space, are compatible even for the minimum possible (embedding) dimension of
the model spaces. This is, in particular, important since it is still an open
question if, in general, there exist finite dimensional model spaces with
Poisson structures compatible with the actions and the usual nondegenerate

that can be described in terms of characteristic scale parameters. For a
nucleus with nucleon+core structure the reduced transition probability, as
determined, e.g., by Coulomb dissociation experiments, shows a typical shape
that depends on the nucleon separation energy and the orbital angular momenta
in the initial and final states. The sensitivity to the final-state interaction
(FSI) between the nucleon and the core can be studied systematically by varying
the strength of the interaction in the continuum. In the case of neutron+core
nuclei analytical results for the reduced transition probabilities are obtained
by introducing the effective-range expansion. The scaling with the relevant
parameters is found explicitly. General trends are observed by studying several
examples of neutron+core and proton+core nuclei in a single-particle model
assuming Woods-Saxon potentials. Many important features of the neutron halo
case can be obtained from a square-well model. Rather simple analytical
formulas are found. The nucleon-core interaction in the continuum affects the
determination of astrophysical S factors at zero energy in the method of
asymptotic normalisation coefficients (ANC). It is also relevant for the
extrapolation of radiative capture cross sections to low energies.

RKDG schemes can carry meaningful sub-structure within a zone that may not need
to be limited. To make this sub-structure visible, we take a sub-cell approach
to detecting zones with discontinuities, known as troubled zones. A
monotonicity preserving (MP) strategy is applied to distinguish between
meaningful sub-structure and shocks. The strategy does not indiscriminately
clip extrema and is, nevertheless, scale-free and problem-independent. The
moments of the troubled zones is corrected using a weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) or Hermite WENO (HWENO) approach. In the course of doing
this work it was also realized that the most significant variation in the
solution is contained in the solution variables and their first moments. Thus
it is shown that the additional moments can be reconstructed using the
variables and their first moments, resulting in a very substantial savings in
computer memory and without any loss in order of accuracy. We call such schemes
hybrid RKDG+HWENO schemes. Explicit, easy to implement formulae have been
catalogued for third and fourth order of spatial accuracy. Several stringent

measurement-assisted programmable quantum processors.
  We focus our attention on the realization of von Neumann measurements and
informationally complete POVMs. It is known that two unitary transformations
implementable by the same programmable processor require mutually {\it
orthogonal} states.
  It turns out that the situation with von Neumann measurements is different.
  Specifically, in order to realize two such measurements one does not have to
use orthogonal program states. On the other hand, the number of the
implementable von Neumann measurements is still limited. As an example of a
programmable processor we use the so-called quantum information distributor.

describes an ordinary quartic anharmonic oscillator with a position-dependent
mass and real and positive coupling constants. This observation elucidates the
classical origin of the reality and positivity of the energy spectrum. We also
discuss the quantum-classical correspondence for this PT-symmetric system,
compute the associated conserved probability density, and comment on the issue
of factor-ordering in the pseudo-Hermitian canonical quantization of the
