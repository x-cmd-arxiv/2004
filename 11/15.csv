recipes for identifying star forming regions, we convert gas into stars which
we follow self-consistently as they impact their surroundings through
supernovae and stellar winds. We investigate how various processes (turbulence,
radiative cooling, self-gravity, and supernovae feedback) structure the ISM,
determine its energetics, and consequently affect its SFR. We find that the
one-point statistical measurement captured by the probability density function
(PDF) is sensitive to the simulated physics. Aside from its effect on the
density structure of the medium, including self-gravity and/or supernovae
feedback changes the dynamics of the medium by halting the decay of the kinetic
energy. Since we find that the SFR depends most strongly on the underlying
velocity field, the SFR declines in the runs lacking a means to sustain the
kinetic energy, and the subsequent high density constrasts. This strong
dependence on the gas velocity dispersion is in agreement with Silk's formula
for the SFR (Silk 2001) which also takes the hot gas porosity, and the average
gas density as important parameters. Measuring the porosity of the hot gas for
the runs with supernovae feedback, we compare Silk's model for the SFR to our
measured SFR and find agreement to better than a factor two.

Multi-object spectroscopy, carried out with FORS1 and FORS2 on the ESO Very

cluster field and to confirm 102 galaxies as cluster members. The mean redshift
of the cluster is $z=0.837 \pm 0.001$ and we estimate the velocity dispersion
of the overall cluster galaxy distribution to be $\sim 1600 \mathrm{km \
s^{-1}}$. The distribution of cluster members is clearly irregular, with two
main clumps that follow the X-ray cluster emission mapped by Chandra. A third
clump of galaxies to the east of the central structure and at the cluster
redshift has also been identified. The two main clumps have velocity
dispersions of $\sim919$ and $\sim737 \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$ respectively, and the
peculiar velocity of the two clumps suggests that they will merge into a single
more massive cluster. A segregation in the star formation activity of the
member galaxies is observed. All star forming galaxies are located outside the
high-density peaks, which are populated only by passive galaxies. A population
of red galaxies (belonging to the cluster red sequence) with clear
post-starburst spectral features and [OII] ($\lambda$3727) emission lines is
observed in the outskirts of the cluster. Two AGNs, which were previously
confused with the diffuse X-ray emission from the intracluster medium in ROSAT

Among the 959 objects with GALEX spectroscopy, 88 are present in the ELAIS
catalog and 19 are galaxies with an optical spectroscopic redshift. The
distribution of redshifts covers the range $0<z<1.6$. The selected galaxies
have bolometric IR luminosities $10<Log(L_{IR})<13$ (deduced from the $15 \mu
m$ flux using ISOCAM) which means that we cover a wide range of galaxies from
normal to Ultra Luminous IR Galaxies. The mean ($\sigma$) UV luminosity (not
corrected for extinction) amounts to $Log(\lambda.L_{1530}) = 9.8 (0.6)$
$L_\sun$ for the low-z ($z \le 0.35$) sample. The UV slope $\beta$ (assuming
$f_\lambda \propto \lambda^\beta$) correlates with the GALEX FUV-NUV color if
the sample is restricted to galaxies below $z < 0.1$. Taking advantage of the
UV and IR data, we estimate the dust attenuation from the IR/UV ratio and
compare it to the UV slope $\beta$. We find that it is not possible to uniquely
estimate the dust attenuation from $\beta$ for our sample of galaxies. These
galaxies are highly extinguished with a median value $A_{FUV} = 2.7 \pm 0.8$.
Once the dust correction applied, the UV- and IR-based SFRs correlate. For the
closest galaxy with the best quality spectrum, we see a feature consistent with
being produced by a bump near 220nm in the attenuation curve.

the absence of dispersion in abundance ratios, at least up to the Fe peak, in

applying a multi-scale MHD-kinetic scheme, coupling MHD simulations to kinetic
computations using stochastic differential equations. We show that 3C273 A,

phonon-light-detection technique. A particularly strong limit for WIMPs with
coherent scattering results from selecting a region of the phonon-light plane
corresponding to tungsten recoils. The observed count rate in the neutron band
is compatible with the rate expected from neutron background. CRESST is
presently being upgraded with a 66 channel SQUID readout system, a neutron
shield and a muon veto system. This results in a significant improvement in

cluster. For G333.1--0.4, we find OB stars and other massive objects in very
early evolutionary stages, possibly still accreting. We obtained $K$--band
spectra of three stars; two show O type photospheric features, while the third
has no photospheric features but does show CO 2.3 $\mu$m band--head emission.
This object is at least as hot as an early B type star based on its intrinsic
luminosity and is surrounded by a circumstellar disc/envelope which produces
near infrared excess emission. A number of other relatively bright cluster
members also display excess emission in the $K$--band, indicative of
disks/envelopes around young massive stars. Based upon the O star photometry
and spectroscopy, the distance to the cluster is 2.6 $\pm$ 0.4 kpc, similar to
a recently derived kinematic (near side) value. The slope of the $K$--band
luminosity function is similar to those found in other young clusters. The mass
function slope is more uncertain, and we find $-1.3 \pm 0.2 < \Gamma < -1.1 \pm
0.2$- for stars with M $> 5$ M$_\odot$ where the upper an lower limits are
calculated independently for different assumptions regarding the excess
emission of the individual massive stars. The number of Lyman continuum photons
derived from the contribution of all massive stars in the cluster is 0.2

(Santolaya-Rey et al.1997) and allow to spectroscopically analyze rather large
samples of massive stars in a reasonable time-scale, using state-of-the-art
physics.
  We describe our (partly approximate) approach to solve the equations of
statistical equilibrium for those elements which are primarily responsible for
line-blocking and blanketing, as well as an approximate treatment of the
line-blocking itself, which is based on a simple statistical approach using
suitable means for line opacities and emissivities. Furthermore, we comment on
our implementation of a consistent temperature structure.
  In the second part, we concentrate on a detailed comparison with results from
those two codes which have been used in alternative spectroscopical
investigations, namely CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) and WM-Basic (Pauldrach
et al. 2001). All three codes predict almost identical temperature structures
and fluxes for lambda > 400 A, whereas at lower wavelengths a number of
discrepancies are found. Optical H/He lines as synthesized by FASTWIND are
compared with results from CMFGEN, obtaining a remarkable coincidence, except
for the HeI singlets in the temperature range between 36,000 to 41,000 K for
dwarfs and between 31,000 to 35,000 K for supergiants, where CMFGEN predicts
much weaker lines. Consequences due to these discrepancies are discussed.

this information to the ground in near real-time, as a GRB trigger for ground

a CdTe detection plane covering 1000 cm^2, placed 35 cm below a coded mask. An

products enjoys several properties that make it extremely suitable for
path-integral Monte Carlo simulations: fast computation of paths, fast Monte
Carlo sampling, and the ability to use different numbers of time slices for the
different degrees of freedom, commensurate with the quantum effects. It is
demonstrated that a Monte Carlo simulation for which particles or small groups
of variables are updated in a sequential fashion has a statistical efficiency
that is always comparable to or better than that of an all-particle or
all-variable update sampler. The sequential sampler results in significant
computational savings if updating a variable costs only a fraction of the cost
for updating all variables simultaneously or if the variables are independent.
In the Levy-Ciesielski representation, the path variables are grouped in a

applied field of strength $H$. We neglect backflow and seek steadily travelling
patterns. The stationary picture yields a semi-infinite wall of strength $\pi$,
bounded by the defect line. We find that the disclination advances into the
region containing the wall at velocity $v(H)$, where $v$ scales as $H/|\log H|$
as long as the magnetic coherence length is greater than the core radius. When
the external field is applied in the presence of a pair of disclinations, their
dynamics is strongly influenced. We compute the expected relative velocity of
the disclinations as a function of distance and field. The natural tendency for
the disclinations to annihilate each other can be overcome by a sufficiently

physical characteristic of a three-phase contact region, by Monte-Carlo (MC)

equilibrium involves a three-phase contact region, the probability distribution
of states of a system as a function of two order parameters depends not only on
the surface tension, but also on the line tension. This probability
distribution can be obtained as a normalized histogram by appropriate MC
simulations, so one can use the combination of histogram analysis and
finite-size scaling to study the properties of a three phase contact region.
Every histogram and results extracted therefrom will depend on the size of the
simulated system. Carrying out MC simulations for a series of system sizes and
extrapolating the results, obtained from the corresponding series of
histograms, to infinite size, one can determine the line tension of the three
phase contact region and the interfacial tensions of all three interfaces (and
hence the contact angles) in an infinite system. To illustrate the proposed
method, it is applied to the three-dimensional ternary fluid mixture, in which
molecular pairs of like species do not interact whereas those of unlike species
interact as hard spheres. The simulated results are in agreement with
expectations.

drifts of fluid elements along stellar latitudes, is an unavoidable feature of
r-modes in the nonlinear theory. We investigate the role of this differential
rotation in the evolution of the l=2 r-mode instability of a newly born, hot,
rapidly rotating neutron star. It is shown that the amplitude of the r-mode
saturates a few hundred seconds after the mode instability sets in. The
saturation amplitude depends on the amount of differential rotation at the time
the instability becomes active and can take values much smaller than unity. It
is also shown that, independently of the saturation amplitude of the mode, the
star spins down to rotation rates that are comparable to the inferred initial
rotation rates of the fastest pulsars associated with supernova remnants.
Finally, it is shown that, when the drift of fluid elements at the time the
instability sets in is significant, most of the initial angular momentum of the
star is transferred to the r-mode and, consequently, almost none is carried
away by gravitational radiation.

The most general neutrino mass matrix conserving L_mu - L_tau predicts
quasi-degenerate neutrino masses with one maximal and two zero mixing angles.
The presence of L_mu - L_tau can also be motivated by the near-bimaximal form
of the neutrino mixing matrix. Furthermore, it is a special case of mu-tau
symmetric mass matrices. Breaking the flavor symmetry by adding a small
flavor-blind term to the neutrino mass matrix and/or by applying radiative
corrections is shown to reproduce the observed neutrino oscillation
phenomenology. Both the normal and inverted mass ordering can be accommodated
within this scheme. Moderate cancellation for neutrinoless double beta decay is
expected. The observables U_{e3}^2 and |1/2 - \sin^2\theta_{23}| are
proportional to the inverse of the fourth power of the common neutrino mass
scale. We comment on whether the atmospheric neutrino mixing is expected to lie
above or below pi/4. We finally present a model based on the see-saw mechanism
which generates a light neutrino mass matrix with an (approximate) L_mu - L_tau
flavor symmetry. This is a minimal model with just one standard Higgs doublet
and three heavy right-handed neutrinos. It needs only small values for the soft
L_mu - L_tau breaking terms to reproduce the phenomenological viable mass
textures analyzed.

tachyons that give contributions near the orbifold fixed point.

and 0.08 fm$^{-3}$. It is shown that the excitations with low multipolarities
are concentrated almost entirely in one strongly collective mode which exhausts
a very large fraction of the energy-weighted sum rule. Since these collective
modes are located at very low energies compared to the giant resonances in
standard nuclei, they may affect significantly the specific heat of baryonic
inner crust matter of neutron stars.

  Observed in the edge Radiation","12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25-29 October 2004,
  Nice (France)",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  Understanding of the transport in a Tokamak plasma is an important issue.
Various mechanisms have been reported in the literature to relate the core
phenomenon to edge phenomenon. Sawtooth and Mirnov oscillations caused by MHD
instabilities are generally observed in Tokamak discharges. Observation of
these effects in the visible radiation from outer edge may offer a possible
means to understand the transport.Oscillations in the visible radiation from
outer region of the plasma have been observed during recent Aditya discharges.
Percentage modulation of these oscillations vary with the Lines of Sight (LOS)
of the chords and surfaces on which they terminate. This has been found in both
the low frequency (~1 kHz) oscillations that seem to correlate with sawteething
in SXR signals and the higher frequency (~10 kHz) oscillations that correlate
well with Mirnov signals indicative of m/n=2/1 mode rotation. This suggests
that the extent to which the MHD instabilities in the central region of the
plasma column are reflected in the edge radiation depends on the interaction of
the plasma with the surface at the extremity of the LOS. The release of
particle/ energy accompanying the MHD instabilities leads to a large influx of
particles from such surfaces. Cross-bispectral analysis suggests that a mode
(having frequency of ~20 kHz) is also generated due to the interaction of
m/n=1/1 (~10 kHz, seen in SXR) and m/n=2/1 (~10 kHz, seen in Mirnov, Visible &
Microwave Interferometer signals). By possible selection rules, this mode seems
to be a m/n=3/2 mode. This mode is seen in Mirnov, Visible & Interferometer
signals. Behaviour of these oscillations on various LOS and their relation to
SXR&Mirnov signals can lead to an understanding of the transport phenomenon.
These observations and our interpretations will be presented.

region of the LHC experiment ATLAS. A TGC consists of a plane of closely spaced
wires maintained at positive high voltage, sandwiched between resistive
grounded cathode planes with an anode wire to cathode plane gap distance
smaller than the wire-to-wire spacing. The TGCs are expected to provide a
trigger signal within 25 ns of the bunch spacing of the LHC accelerator, with
an efficiency exceeding 95%, while exposed to an effective photon and neutron
background ranging from 30 to 500 Hz/cm2. About 2,500 out of the 3,600 ATLAS
TGCs are being produced at the Weizmann institute in Israel, and in Shandong
University in China. Once installed in the ATLAS detector the TGCs will be
inaccessible. A vigorous production quality control program is therefore
implemented at the production sites. Furthermore, after chamber completion, a
thorough program of quality assurance is implemented to ensure the efficient
performance of the chambers during more than ten years of operation in the LHC
high rate environment. This program consists of a detailed mapping of the
detectors response using cosmic rays, as well as checking the chambers behavior
using a high rate radiation source. An aging test performed on five chambers in
a serial gas connection is presented. Finally the results of the chambers
certification tests performed at CERN before the installation in ATLAS are
