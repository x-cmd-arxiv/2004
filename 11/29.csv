observed data leads to inferred magnetic fields which are at variance with
those of galactic millisecond radiopulsars. This indicates the need for either
additional spin-down torques (eg. gravitational radiation) or an improved
accretion model. We show that a simple consistent accretion model can be
arrived at by accounting for radiation pressure in rapidly accreting systems
(above a few percent of the Eddington accretion rate). In our model the inner
disk region is thick and significantly sub-Keplerian, and the estimated
equilibrium periods are such that the LMXB neutron stars have properties that
accord well with the galactic millisecond radiopulsar sample. The implications
for future gravitational-wave observations are also discussed briefly.

We present our results in a form which permits the use of data for any given

present a mild dependence upon metal content. Moreover, the use of different PA

because they present smaller intrinsic dispersions. At the same time, the use
of the PAC relations improves the accuracy in the long-period (log P >= 1)

objects inside the instability strip. We performed a detailed comparison
between evolutionary and pulsation ages for a sizable sample of LMC (15) and
SMC (12) clusters which host at least two Cepheids. In order to avoid deceptive
uncertainties in the photometric absolute zero-point, we adopted the
homogeneous set of B,V,I data for clusters and Cepheids collected by OGLE. We
also adopted the same reddening scale. The different age estimates agree at the
level of 20 % for LMC clusters and of 10 % for SMC clusters. We also performed
the same comparison for two Galactic clusters (NGC6067, NGC7790) and the
difference in age is smaller than 20 %. These findings support the use of PA

can form an HI ring as is observed in Holmberg I. Three energetic mechanisms
are considered: multiple supernova explosions (SNe), a hypernova explosion
associated with a gamma ray burst (GRB), and the vertical impact of a high
velocity cloud (HVC). The total released energy has an upper limit of 10^54
ergs. We find that multiple SNe are in general more effective in producing
shells that break out of the disk than a hypernova explosion of the same total
energy. As a consequence, multiple SNe form rings with a high ring-to-center
contrast K<100 in the HI column density, whereas single hypernova explosions
form rings with K<10. Only multiple SNe can reproduce both the size (diameter
\~1.7 kpc) and the ring-to-center contrast (K ~ 15-20) of the HI ring in
Hoolmberg I. High velocity clouds create HI rings that are much smaller in size
(< 0.8 kpc) and contrast (K < 4.5) than seen in Holmberg I. We construct model
position-velocity (pV) diagrams and find that they can be used to distinguish
among different HI ring formation mechanisms. The observed pV-diagrams of
Holmberg I are best reproduced by multiple SNe. We conclude that the giant HI
ring in Holmberg I is most probably formed by multiple SNe. We also find that
the appearance of the SNe-driven shell in the integrated HI image depends on
the inclination angle of the galaxy. In nearly face-on galaxies, the integrated
HI image shows a ring of roughly constant HI column density surrounding a deep
central depression, whereas in considerably inclined galaxies (i > 45 deg) the
HI image is characterized by two kidney-shaped density enhancements and a mild
central depression.

tricky problem. Indeed, it is a degenerate problem since many parameters affect
the observables. The stellar population synthesis issue thus deserves a deep
and rigourous analysis. In this paper we present a method of inversion which
uses as observables the intensities at each pixel of a galactic spectrum and
provides the stellar contribution to luminosity of all stars considered in a
database. The main contribution of this paper to the synthesis problem is that
it provides an analytical computation of the uncertainties accompanying a
solution. This constitutes an important improvement relative to previous
methods which do not provide such infomation except in the method described by
Pelat (1997) and Moultaka & Pelat (2000). The latter uses the equivalent widths
and intensities of stellar spectra in order to reproduce the equivalent widths
of a galactic spectrum. The novelty of this work relative to the previous one
is that the dust emission present in the IR spectra can be modeled as well as
the velocity dispersion of stars that broadens the lines of a galactic
spectrum. Tests are also performed in order to estimate the reliability of the
method and the influence on the results of an additive continuum present in a
studied spectrum, for example in the case of AGNs.

characteristics intermediate between the FRI and FRII morphologies. We clearly
detect point-like emission coincident with the radio-core of 3C401, although
the spatial resolution of even Chandra is only 2kpc at the distance of 3C401
(z=0.201) and so the possibility remains that this is a dense (and rapidly
cooling) thermal gaseous core in the center of the ICM atmosphere. Strong
departures from spherical symmetry in the central 10-20kpc of the ICM clearly
suggest interaction between the ICM and the radio-lobes of 3C401. A central
X-ray bar probably results from the evacuation of two ICM cavities by the
expanding radio lobes. Beyond these central regions, the cluster possesses a
flatter profile than many clusters of comparable mass suggesting the importance
of ICM heating and entropy injection by 3C401. We detect an interesting
cross-like structure in the ICM on 100kpc scales. We speculate that this could
be a radio-galaxy induced disturbance corresponding to a time when 3C401 was
substantially more powerful. A particularly exciting possibility is that this
cross-like structure corresponds to a large scale global g-mode oscillation

remaining gas out of the cluster. Especially winds of high mass stars and
definitely the on-set of the first super novae can remove the residual gas from
a cluster. This leads to a very violent mass-loss and leaves the cluster out of
virial equilibrium. Standard models predict that the star formation efficiency
(SFE) has to be about 33 per cent for sudden (within one crossing-time of the
cluster) gas expulsion to retain some of the stars in a bound cluster. If the
efficiency is lower the stars of the cluster disperse completely. Recent
observations reveal that in strong star bursts star clusters do not form in
isolation but in complexes containing dozens and up to several hundred star
clusters (super-clusters). By carrying out numerical experiments we demonstrate
that in these environments (i.e. the deeper potential of the star cluster
complex and the merging process of the star clusters within these
super-clusters) the SFEs could be as low as 20 per cent, leaving a
gravitationally bound stellar population. We demonstrate that the merging of
the first clusters happens faster than the dissolution time therefore enabling
more stars to stay bound within the merger object. Such an object resembles the
outer Milky Way globular clusters and the faint fuzzy star clusters recently
discovered in NGC 1023.

characteristic of the metallic double perovskite series has been observed near
the Fermi level ($E_{\rm F}$), although it is less distinct compared to the
Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ case. The leading near-$E_{\rm F}$ structure has a very weak
spectral weight at $E_{\rm F}$ above the metal-insulator transition (MIT)
temperature $T_{\rm MI}$ of $\sim$140 K, and it loses the $E_{\rm F}$ weight
below $T_{\rm MI}$, forming a small energy gap.

coefficients within the macroscopic limit of the symmetry term, disregarding
any reminder of a binding formula. The results are next exploited to constrain
the dependence of symmetry energy on nuclear density, essential for the
neutron-star predictions.

canonical ensemble (CE) give the grand canonical (GC) results in large
multiplicity limit, the fluctuations involving second moments do not respect
this asymptotic behaviour. Instead, the asymptotics are strikingly different,
giving a new handle in study of statistical particle number fluctuations in
relativistic nuclear reactions. Here we study the analytical large volume
asymptotics to general case of multispecies hadron gas carrying fixed baryon
number, strangeness and electric charge. By means of Monte Carlo simulations we
have also studied the general multiplicity probability distributions taking
into account the decay chains of resonance states.

been studied in Au+Au collisions at full RHIC energy of sqrt(s) = 200 GeV
within the microscopic quark-gluon string model. The QGSM simulation results
for the directed flow v_1 show antiflow alignment within the pseudorapidity
range |eta| < 2 in a fair agreement with the experimental v_1(eta) data, but
cannot reproduce the further development of the antiflow up to |eta| around
3.5. The eta dependence of the elliptic flow v_2 extracted from the simulations
agrees well with the experimental data in the whole pseudorapidity range for
different centrality classes. The centrality dependence of the integrated
elliptic flow of charged hadrons in the QGSM almost coincides with the PHOBOS
experimental distribution. The transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic
flow of identified and inclusive charged hadrons is studied also. The model
reproduces quantitatively the low p_T part of the distributions rather good,
but underestimates the measured elliptic flow for transverse momenta p_T > 1
GeV/c. Qualitatively, however, the model is able to reproduce the saturation of
the v_2(p_T) spectra with rising p_T as well as the crossing of the elliptic
flow for mesons and baryons.

Assuming that the number of genes expressed before the reproduction age grows
linearly with the genome size and that the mutation rate per genome and
generation is constant, we have found that the fraction of defective genes
expressed before the minimum reproduction age drops with the genome size, while
the number of defective genes eliminated by the genetic death grows with genome
size. Thus, the evolutionary costs decrease with enlarging the genome. After
rescaling the time scale according to the mutational clock, age distributions
of populations do not depend on the genome size. Nevertheless, enlarging the
genome increases the reproduction potential of populations.

to repeat this kind of process only three times to establish a maximally
entangled state directly from an arbitrary initial mixed state, with no need to
prepare the state of the qubits in advance or to rearrange the setup step by

with the maximum entanglement, provided that the coupling constants are
