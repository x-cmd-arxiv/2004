detect absorption due to cold gas in our own Galaxy and warm gas in the

O VII absorption, from which we deduce a temperature between 0.03 and 0.2 keV.
In IC 4329A we detect absorption from the host galaxy as well as from a warm
absorber, close to the nucleus, which has 4 components. The absorption from the
host galaxy is well modeled by neutral material. The warm absorber detected in
IC 4329A is photoionized and has an ionization range between log $\xi$ = -1.37
and log $\xi$ = 2.7. A broad excess is measured at the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ and N
VII Ly$\alpha$ emission lines, which can be modeled by either disklines or
multiple Gaussians. From the lightcurve we find that the source changed
luminosity by about 20 % over the 140 ks observation, while the spectral shape,
i.e. the softness ratio did not vary. In the EPIC spectra a narrow Fe K$\alpha$
and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ emission line are detected. The narrowness of the Fe
K$\alpha$ line and the fact that there is no evidence for flux variability
between different observations leads us to conclude that the Fe K$\alpha$ line
is formed at a large distance from the central black hole.

addresses the question of giant planet frequency in 47 Tuc by observing, from
the ground, a 52'x52' field centered on the cluster for 30.4 nights. Hence this
work is most sensitive to the uncrowded outer regions of the cluster and
concentrates on 21,920 main sequence stars (~solar in mass). This work
comprises the largest ground-based transit search of a globular cluster to

  Monte Carlo simulations predict that seven planets should be present in our

found no transit events. Being consistent with the cluster core null detection
of Gilliland and coworkers, our result indicates that system metallicity is the
dominant effect inhibiting Hot Jupiter formation in this environment.

yet there is no signature of an X-ray response. There are other intervals of
time where optical flaring and UV flaring is occurring, but these cannot be
related to the contemporaneous X-ray flaring: the time-integrated luminosities
do not match the instantaneous X-ray flare luminosity, as one would expect for
the Neupert effect. We investigate the probability of chance occurrences of

in which the ``orphan'' TeV flare may originate from relativistic protons,
interacting with an external photon field supplied by electron-synchrotron
radiation reflected off a dilute reflector. While the external photons will be
virtually ``invisible'' to the co-moving ultrarelativistic electrons in the jet

excite the $\Delta$ resonance from relativistic protons with Lorentz factors of

several galaxies in the fields very close to the quasars, in addition to the
lens galaxies themselves. The lens modeling implies that these nearby galaxies
contribute significantly to the lens potentials. On larger scales, we have

Imaging Survey observations well distributed in phase within the star's
0.56432d period shows an AB=4.9mag variation in the far UV (1350-1750A) band
and an AB=1.8mag variation in the near UV (1750-2750A) band, compared with only
a 0.8mag variation in the broad, unfiltered ROTSE-I (4500-10000A) band. These
GALEX UV observations are the first to reveal a large RR Lyrae amplitude
variation at wavelengths below 1800A. We compare the GALEX and ROTSE-I
observations to predictions made by recent Kurucz stellar atmosphere models. We
use published physical parameters for the comparable period (0.57433d),
well-observed RR Lyrae star WY Antliae to compute predicted FUV, NUV, and
ROTSE-I light curves for J143753.84+345924.8. The observed light curves agree
with the Kurucz predictions for [Fe/H]=-1.25 to within AB=0.2mag in the GALEX
NUV and ROTSE-I bands, and within 0.5mag in the FUV. At all metallicities
between solar and one hundredth solar, the Kurucz models predict 6-8mag of
variation at wavelengths between 1000-1700A. Other variable stars with similar
temperature variations, such as Cepheids, should also have large-amplitude FUV
light curves, observable during the ongoing GALEX imaging surveys.

observations of damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs) and sub-DLAs, we model their H2
abundance as a function of dust-to-gas ratio, including H2 self-shielding and
dust extinction against dissociating photons. Then, we constrain the physical
state of gas by using H2 data. Using H2 excitation data for DLA with H2
detections, we derive a gas density 1.5 < log n [cm^-3] < 2.5, temperature 1.5
< log T [K] < 3, and internal UV radiation field (in units of the Galactic
value) 0.5 < log \chi < 1.5. We then find that the observed relation between
molecular fraction and dust-to-gas ratio of the sample is naturally explained
by the above conditions. However, it is still possible that H2 deficient DLAs
and sub-DLAs with H2 fractions less than ~ 10^-6 are in a more diffuse and
warmer state. The efficient photodissociation by the internal UV radiation
field explains the extremely small H2 fraction (< 10^-6) observed for \kappa <
1/30 (\kappa is the dust-to-gas ratio in units of the Galactic value); H2
self-shielding causes a rapid increase and the large variations of H2 abundance
for \kappa > 1/30. We finally propose an independent method to estimate the
star formation rates of DLAs from H2 abundances; such rates are then critically
compared with those derived from other proposed methods. The implications for
the contribution of DLAs to the cosmic star formation history are briefly

interplay of convection, radiation, dust formation, and gravitational settling,
which possibly provides an explanation for the observed variability. The result
is an element depletion of the dust forming regions and an element enrichment
of the dust evaporating sites. The formation of dust cloud structures in
substellar atmospheres is demonstrated based on a consistent theoretical
description of dust formation and destruction, gravitational settling, and
element depletion including the effect of convective overshoot.
  Since the viscosity is small in brown dwarf atmospheres, the convection
creates a turbulent environment with fluctuations of all thermodynamic state
variables on a wide range of spatial scales. Hence, the classical turbulent
closure problem needs to be tackled in connection with dust formation in
substellar objects, because a complete three-dimensional and time-dependent
solution of the model equations is simply not possible. Structure formation may
be seeded on the smallest scales, when chemical processes are involved. In
order to understand the interaction of turbulence and dust formation, we have
performed investigations of the smallest scale regimes in 1D and in 2D in order

presence of the SO interaction spin is not conserved, the electron-electron
interaction renormalizes the spin-Hall conductivity as well as the frequency of
the CSR. The effects of the electron interaction in systems with the SO
interaction are analyzed both phenomenologically and microscopically.

  molecular field theory for ionic fluids","to be published in Journal of Physical Chemistry B",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  Structural and thermodynamic properties of ionic fluids are related to those
of a simpler ``mimic'' system with short ranged intermolecular interactions in
a spatially varying effective field by use of Local Molecular Field (LMF)
theory, already successfully applied to nonuniform simple fluids. By
consistently using the LMF approximation to describe only the slowly varying
part of the Coulomb interaction, which we view as arising from a rigid Gaussian
charge distribution with an appropriately chosen width $\sigma$, exceptionally
accurate results can be found. In this paper we study a uniform system of
charged hard spheres in a uniform neutralizing background, where these ideas
can be presented in their simplest form. At low densities the LMF theory
reduces to a generalized version of the Poisson-Boltzmann approximation, but
the predicted structure factor satisfies the exact Stillinger-Lovett moment
conditions, and with optimal choice of $\sigma$ the lowest order approximation
remains accurate for much stronger couplings. At high density and strong
couplings the pair correlation function in the uniform mimic system with short
ranged interactions is very similar to that of the full ionic system. A simple
analytic formula can then describe the difference in internal energy between
the ionic system and the associated mimic system.

street networks characterised by different patterns and historical roots. The
authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a
primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges.
In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are
edges, is constructed by means of an innovative generalisation model named
Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity
of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a
comparative study of some structural properties of the networks, seeking
significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network
analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the
authors show that most of the considered networks have a broad degree
distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties
as well.

expected to give rise to frustration, so that dimerization and formation of

study this crossover using bosonization technique. The effective action is
solved both by the Self Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA)and by
Renormalization Group (RG) approach starting from a bosonized description. The
SCHA allows to analyze the lowfrequency regime and determine the coupling
constant associated with the spin-Peierls transition. However, it fails to
describe the SU(2) invariant limit. This limit is tackled by the RG. Three
regimes are found. For $\omega_0\ll\Delta_s$, where $\Delta_s$ is the gap in
the static limit $\omega_0\to 0$, the system is in the adiabatic regime, and
the gap remains of order $\Delta_s$. For $\omega_0>\Delta_s$, the system enters
the antiadiabatic regime, and the gap decreases rapidly as $\omega_0$
increases. Finally, for $\omega_0>\omega_{BKT}$, where $\omega_{BKT}$ is an
increasing function of the spin phonon coupling, the spin gap vanishes via a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our results are discussed in

phase transitions: For a given property of the network, there is a critical
threshold, corresponding to the minimum amount of the communication effort or
power expenditure by individual nodes, above (resp. below) which the property
exists with high (resp. a low) probability. For sensor networks, properties of
interest include simple and multiple degrees of connectivity/coverage. First,
we investigate the network topology according to the region of deployment, the
number of deployed sensors and their transmitting/sensing ranges. More
specifically, we consider the following problems: Assume that $n$ nodes, each
capable of sensing events within a radius of $r$, are randomly and uniformly
distributed in a 3-dimensional region $\mathcal{R}$ of volume $V$, how large
must the sensing range be to ensure a given degree of coverage of the region to
monitor? For a given transmission range, what is the minimum (resp. maximum)
degree of the network? What is then the typical hop-diameter of the underlying
network? Next, we show how these results affect algorithmic aspects of the

invariance and their connection with the baryon number of the Universe, I
sketch the history of CP violation studies since its totally unexpected
discovery in 1964. For about 30 years CP violation could be described by a
single number; this has changed dramatically in the years around the turn of
the millenium: (i) The existence of {\em direct} CP violation was unequivocally
established in the decays of long lived kaons. (ii) For the first time CP
violation was observed in a system other than that of neutral kaons, namely in
$B\to \psi K_S$. The findings are in impressive agreement with the prediction
of the CKM ansatz, which thus has been promoted to the status of a tested
theory. These new insights were made possible by close feedback between theory
and experiment as well as advances in detector design and a novel machine
concept, namely that of an asymmetric collider. We also have direct {\em
experimental} evidence that the observed CP violation in $K_L$ and B decays is
matched by a violation of microscopic time reversal violation, as required by
CPT symmetry. More recently CP violation has been observed also in $B\to
\pi^+\pi^-$ and $B\to K^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}$. A few comments are added on subtle
aspects of direct CP violation. While we know that the CKM dynamics are
irrelevant for generating the baryon number of the Universe -- i.e. hitherto
unknown forces have to be driving it -- we have also learnt that such `New
Physics' is likely to contain CP violation of sufficient strength.

<\bar\psi\psi> in the mass-splittings between the scalar-pseudoscalar mesons is
emphasized. The emerging value of the running charm quark mass for reproducing
the well-known D(0-) and Ds(0-) masses is: mc(mc)=1.13^{+0.08}_{-0.04} GeV,
which confirms previous estimates from this channel [2]. Using this value, the
sum rules give: M{Ds(0+)}= (2297+- 113) MeV, and a small SU(3) breaking:
M{Ds{(0+)}}-M{D{(0+)}}= 25 MeV. Extending the analysis to the B-system, we find

approximate (heavy and light) flavour and spin symmetries of the

a small tree amplitude. At last, we comment on the various mechanism proposed
in the literature to explain the abnormal $B\to \phi K^*$ polarization data,
none of which are satisfactory.

(physics/9801019), we begin in this second paper to study the canonical (or
``instantaneous'') formulation of classical field theories. The canonical
formluation works with fields defined as time-evolving cross sections of
bundles over a Cauchy surface, rather than as sections of bundles over
spacetime as in the covariant formulation. In Chapter 5 we begin to relate
these approaches to classical field theory; in particular, we show how
covariant multisymplectic geometry induces the instantaneous symplectic
geometry of cotangent bundles of sections of fields over a Cauchy surface. In
Chapter 6, we proceed to consider field dynamics. A crucial feature of our
discussion here is the degeneracy of the Lagrangian functionals for the field
theories of interest. As a consequence of this degeneracy, we have constraints
on the choice of initial data, and gauge freedom in the evolution of the
fields. Chapter 6 considers the role of initial value constraints and gauge
transformations in Hamiltonian field dynamics. In Chapter 7, we then describe
how covariant momentum maps defined on the multiphase space induce
""energy-momentum maps'' on the instantaneous phase spaces. We show that for a
group action which leaves the Cauchy surface invariant, this energy-momentum
map coincides with the usual notion of a momentum map. We also show, when the

This is done by applying the construction of entangled Markov chains obtained
from classical Markov chains with infinite state--space. The formula giving the
joint correlations arises from the corresponding classical formula by replacing
the usual matrix multiplication by the Schur multiplication. In this way, we
provide nontrivial examples of entangled Markov chains on $\bar{\cup_{J\subset

factor, $J$ a finite interval of $Z$, and the bar the von Neumann tensor
product between von Neumann algebras. We then have new nontrivial examples of
quantum random walks which could play a r\^ole in quantum information theory.
  In view of applications to quantum statistical mechanics too, we see that the
ergodic type of an entangled Markov chain is completely determined by the
corresponding ergodic type of the underlying classical chain, provided that the
latter admits an invariant probability distribution. This result parallels the
corresponding one relative to the finite dimensional case.
  Finally, starting from random walks on discrete ICC groups, we exhibit

  The dynamic optimization problems treated by the calculus of variations are
usually solved with the help of the 2nd order Euler-Lagrange differential
equations. These equations are, generally speaking, nonlinear, and very hard to
solve. One way to address the problem is to obtain conservation laws of lower
order than those of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. While in
Physics and Economics the question of existence of conservation laws is treated
in a rather natural way, because the application itself suggest the
conservation laws (e.g., conservation of energy, income/health law), from a
strictly mathematical point of view, given a problem of the calculus of
variations, it is not obvious how one might derive a conservation law or, for
that matter, if it even has a conservation law. The question we address is thus
to develop computational facilities, based on a systematic method, which
permits to identify functionals that have conservation laws. The central result
we use is the celebrated Noether's theorem. This theorem links conservation
laws with the invariance properties of the problem (with symmetries), and
provides an algorithm for finding conservation laws. Thus the problem is
reduced to the one of finding the variational symmetries. We show how a
Computer Algebra System can help to find the symmetries and the conservation
laws in the calculus of variations. Several illustrative examples are given.

characterized by an hierarchy of relaxation times corresponding to various

in this paper, reflects qualitative aspects of Bogolubov's hierarchy. It is
shown that, applied to wall flows, this equation leads to qualitatively correct

studies resonance of such clusters. This work is stimulated by a recent

remove Newton's error quantitatively, and also lead to the most basic formulas
of quantum mechanics without reference to any of the pioneering experiments of
the late nineteenth century. An alternative formulation of the wave-particle
duality principle is then suggested which allows the phenomena of interference
and diffraction to be understood in terms of statistical distributions of large

work, we show how the entanglement and the relative phase between the states
describing the coin degree of freedom of each particle will influence the
evolution of the quantum walk. In particular, the probability to find at least
one particle in a certain position after $N$ steps of the walk, as well as the
average distance between the two particles, can be larger or smaller than the
case of two unentangled particles, depending on the initial conditions we
choose. This resource can then be tuned according to our needs, in particular
to enhance a given application (algorithmic or other) based on a quantum walk.
Experimental implementations are briefly discussed.
