relatively early epoch in galactic evolution when the formation of the stellar

level ~0.01 such that cooling could not keep up with radiative heating. A
considerable amount of gas was expelled at that time and black hole accretion

sight to 25 white dwarfs in the local interstellar medium (LISM) obtained with
the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). We find that interstellar
OVI absorption along all sightlines is generally weak, and in a number of
cases, completely absent. No OVI absorption was detected with significance
greater than 2 sigma for 12 of the 25 stars, where the 1 sigma uncertainty is 4
mA, equivalent to an OVI column density of ~3 x 10^12 cm^-2. Of the remaining
stars, most have column densities N(OVI) < 10^13 cm^-2 and no column densities
exceed 1.7 x 10^13 cm^-2. For lines of sight to hot (T_eff > 40,000 K) white
dwarfs, there is some evidence that the OVI absorption may be at least
partially photospheric or circumstellar in origin. We interpret the ""patchy""
distribution of OVI absorption in terms of a model where OVI is formed in
evaporative interfaces between cool clouds and the hot, diffuse gas in the
Local Bubble (LB). If the clouds contain tangled or tangential magnetic fields,
then thermal conduction will be quenched over most of the cloud surface, and
OVI will be formed only in local ""patches"" where conduction is allowed to
operate. We find an average OVI space density in the LISM of 2.4 x 10^-8 cm^-3,
which is similar to, or slightly larger than, the value in the Galactic disk
over kpc scales. This local density implies an average OVI column density of ~7
x 10^12 cm^-2 over a path length of 100 pc within the LB. The OVI data
presented here appears to be inconsistent with the model proposed by
Breitschwerdt & Schmutzler (1994), in which highly ionized gas at low kinetic
temperature (~50,000 K) permeates the LB. Our survey results are consistent
with the supernova-driven cavity picture of Cox & Smith (1974).

show that the galaxy brightness profile and colour gradient as well as the
behaviour of the cumulative globular cluster specific frequency, are compatible
with the presence of two dominant stellar populations, associated with the so
called ""blue"" and ""red"" globular cluster families. These globular families are
characterized by different intrinsic specific frequencies (defined in terms of
each stellar population): Sn=3.3 +/- 0.3 in the case of the red globulars and
Sn=14.3 +/- 2.5 for the blue ones. We stress that this result is not
necessarily conflicting with recent works that point out a clear difference
between the metallicity distribution of (resolved) halo stars and globulars
when comparing their number statistics. The inferred specific frequencies imply
that, in terms of their associated stellar populations, the formation of the
blue globulars took place with an efficiency about 6 times higher than that
corresponding to their red counterparts. The similarity of the spatial
distribution of the blue globulars with that inferred for dark matter, as well
as with that of the X ray emiting hot gas associated with NGC 1399, is
emphasized. The impact of a relatively unconspicuous low metallicity
population, that shares the properties of the blue globulars, as a possible
source of chemical enrichment early in the formation history of the galaxy is
also briefly discussed.

that strong z <~ 6 winds cannot fully explain the observed enrichment, and that

rather are primarily apparent in the dust temperatures of sources in flux
limited surveys. Statistically significant differences in the redshift

hydrodynamics code. We focus on the physical structure of the shell swept up by
the shock front (SF) preceding the ionization front (IF). After the IF reaches
the initial Stromgren radius, the SF emerges in front of the IF and the
geometrically thin shell bounded with the IF and the SF is formed. The gas
density inside the shell is about 10-100 times as high as the ambient gas
density. Initially the dissociation fronts expands faster than IF and the PDR
is formed outside the HII region. Thereafter the IF and SF gradually overtakes
the proceeding dissociation fronts (DFs), and eventually DFs are taken in the
shell. The chemical composition within the shell is initially atomic, but
hydrogen and carbon monoxide molecules are gradually formed. This is partly
because the IF and SF overtake DFs and SF enters the molecular region, and
partly because the reformation timescales of the molecules become shorter than
the dynamical timescale. The gas shell becomes dominated by the molecular gas
by the time of gravitational fragmentation, which agrees with some recent
observations. A simple estimation of star formation rate in the shell can
provide a significant star formation rate in our galaxy.

the nuclear region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5252. The observed velocity
field is consistent with gas in regular rotation with superposed localized

accurately reproduced by adding to the stellar mass component a compact dark
mass of MBH = 0.95 (-0.45;+1.45) 10E9 M(sun), very likely a supermassive black
hole. Contrarily to results obtained in similar studies rotational broadening
is sufficient to reproduce also the behaviour of line widths. The MBH estimated
for NGC 5252 is in good agreement with the correlation between MBH and bulge
mass. The comparison with the MBH vs sigma relationship is less stringent
(mostly due to the relatively large error in sigma); NGC 5252 is located above
the best fit line by between 0.3 and 1.2 dex, i.e. 1 - 4 times the dispersion
of the correlation. Both the galaxy's and MBH of NGC 5252 are substantially
larger than those usually estimated for Seyfert galaxies but, on the other

with the hard X-ray luminosity, we estimate that NGC 5252 is emitting at a
fraction ~ 0.005 of L(Edd). In this sense, this active nucleus appears to be a
quasar relic, now probably accreting at a low rate, rather than a low black
hole mass counterpart of a QSO.

process down to the opacity limit, the first of which was reported by Bate,
Bonnell & Bromm. The initial conditions of the two calculations are identical
except for the radii of the clouds, which are chosen so that the mean densities
and mean thermal Jeans masses of the clouds differ by factors of nine and
three, respectively. We find that the denser cloud, with the lower mean thermal
Jeans mass, produces a higher proportion of brown dwarfs and has a lower
characteristic (median) mass of the stars and brown dwarfs. This dependence of
the initial mass function (IMF) on the density of the cloud may explain the
observation that the Taurus star-forming region appears to be deficient in
brown dwarfs when compared with the Orion Trapezium cluster. The new
calculation also produces wide binaries (separations >20 AU), one of which is a
wide binary brown dwarf system. Based on the hydrodynamical calculations, we
develop a simple accretion/ejection model for the origin of the IMF. In the
model, all stars and brown dwarfs begin with the same mass (set by the opacity
limit for fragmentation) and grow in mass until their accretion is terminated
stochastically by their ejection from the cloud through dynamically
interactions. The model predicts that the main variation of the IMF in
different star-forming environments should be in the location of the peak (due
to variations in the mean thermal Jeans mass of the cloud) and in the
substellar regime. However, the slope of the IMF at high-masses may depend on
the dispersion in the accretion rates of protostars.

are known to exhibit (quasi)stationary states that defy the standard,
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanical prescriptions. For handling such
anomalous systems (or at least some classes of them), {\it nonextensive}
statistical mechanics has been proposed based on the entropy $S_{q}\equiv k
(1-\sum_{i=1}^Wp_i^{q})/(q-1)$, with $S_1=-k\Sigma_{i=1}^{W} p_i \ln p_i$
(Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy). Special collective correlations can be
mathematically constructed such that the strictly {\it additive} entropy is now
$S_q$ for an adequate value of $q \ne 1$, whereas Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is
{\it nonadditive}. Since important classes of systems exist for which the
strict additivity of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy is replaced by asymptotic
additivity (i.e., extensivity), a variety of classes are expected to exist for
which the strict additivity of $S_q (q\ne 1)$ is similarly replaced by
asymptotic additivity (i.e., extensivity). All probabilistically well defined
systems whose adequate entropy is $S_{1}$ are called {\it extensive} (or {\it
normal}). They correspond to a number $W^{\it eff}$ of {\it effectively}
occupied states which grows {\it exponentially} with the number $N$ of elements
(or subsystems). Those whose adequate entropy is $S_q (q \ne 1)$ are currently
called {\it nonextensive} (or {\it anomalous}). They correspond to $W^{\it
eff}$ growing like a {\it power} of $N$. To illustrate this scenario, recently
addressed, we provide in this paper details about systems composed by $N=2,3$
two-state subsystems.

new form of order smoothly emerges in its ground state. QCPs are of great
current interest because of their singular ability to influence the finite
temperature properties of materials. Recently, heavy-fermion metals have played
a key role in the study of antiferromagnetic QCPs. To accommodate the heavy
electrons, the Fermi surface of the heavy-fermion paramagnet is larger than
that of an antiferromagnet. An important unsolved question concerns whether the
Fermi surface transformation at the QCP develops gradually, as expected if the
magnetism is of spin density wave (SDW) type, or suddenly as expected if the
heavy electrons are abruptly localized by magnetism. Here we report
measurements of the low-temperature Hall coefficient ($R_H$) - a measure of the
Fermi surface volume - in the heavy-fermion metal YbRh2Si2 upon field-tuning it
from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. $R_H$ undergoes an
increasingly rapid change near the QCP as the temperature is lowered,
extrapolating to a sudden jump in the zero temperature limit. We interpret
these results in terms of a collapse of the large Fermi surface and of the
heavy-fermion state itself precisely at the QCP.

influences the polariton condensation kinetics. In particular, for values of

condensate into the collective excitation modes results in strong quantum
fluctuations that deplete the condensate. A numerical evaluation based on a
few-level scheme shows that the condensate fraction is expected to be lower

a time scale determined by the \emph{quasiparticle} relaxation rate. The
equilibrium distribution function depends on the full spectral density and

the corrections to the abundance of cold dark matter candidates are

gauginos are massless while squarks and sleptons are superheavy. We build such

unified into a simple group, these theories preserve the successful
supersymmetric relation of gauge couplings, as they start out with equal SU(3)
and SU(2) couplings and the correct initial sin^2\theta_W at the
compactification scale of M_{GUT}\simeq 2x10^{16} GeV, and they have the
minimal low-energy particle content of split supersymmetry. We also propose a
mechanism in which the gauginos and higgsinos are further protected by a
discrete R-symmetry against gravitational corrections, as the gravitino gets an
invariant Dirac mass by pairing with a member of a Kaluza-Klein tower of
spin-3/2 particles. In addition to the models proposed here, split
supersymmetry offers novel strategies for realistic model-building. So,
TeV-scale string models previously dismissed because of rapid proton decay, or
incorrect sin^2\theta_W, or because there were no unused dimensions into which
to dilute the strength of gravity, can now be reconsidered as candidates for
realistic split theories with string scale near M_{GUT}, as long as the

For high energies s>> 1, fixed scattering angle, and very weak coupling g<<
1/s, the four-graviton amplitude exhibits the usual exponential suppression. As
the energy approaches 1/g, the suppression gradually diminishes until there
appears a strong amplification near a new pole coming from the exchange of a
(p,q) string. At energies s<< 1/\sqrt{g}, the pure D instanton contribution to
the scattering amplitude is found to produce a factor $A_4^{Dinst}\cong \exp (c
g^{3/2}e^{-{2\pi\over g}} s^3)$. At energies $1/\sqrt{g} << s<< 1/g $, the
D-instanton factor becomes $A_4^{Dinst}\cong \exp (2 e^{-{2\pi\over g_s}+\pi
g_s s^2})$. At higher energies s>> 1/g the D-instanton contribution becomes
very important, and one finds an oscillatory behavior which alternates
suppression and amplification. This suggests that non-perturbative effects can
lead to a high-energy behavior which is significantly different from the
perturbative string behavior.

each other by T-duality. Such string vacua are expected to describe non-compact
Calabi-Yau compactifications, typically ALE fibrations over (weighted)
projective spaces. We find that when the Liouville ($SL(2;R)/U(1)$) theory is
coupled to minimal models, there exist only (c,c), (a,a) ((c,a), (a,c))-type of
massless states in CY 3 and 4-folds and the theory possesses only complex
(K\""{a}hler) structure deformations. Thus the space-time has the characteristic
feature of a conifold type singularity whose deformation (resolution) is given
by the N=2 Liouville (SL(2;R)/U(1)) theory.
  Spectra of compact BPS D-branes determined from the open string sector are
compared with those of massless moduli. We compute the open string Witten index
and determine intersection numbers of vanishing cycles. We also study non-BPS
branes of the theory that are natural extensions of the ``unstable B-branes''
of the SU(2) WZW model in hep-th/0105038.

freedom has been explored. The significant enhancement of he fusion cross
setion at sub-barrier energies was understood in terms of the dynamical
processes arising from strong couplings to collective inelastic excitations of
the target and projectile. However, in the case of reactions where breakup
becomes an important process, conflicing model predictions and experimental
results have been reported in the literature. Excitation functions for sub- and
near-barrier total (complete + incomplete) fusion cross sections have been
measured for the $^{6,7}$Li + $^{59}$Co at the Vivitron facility and at the 8UD
Pelletron tandem facility using standard $\gamma$-ray techniques. The data
extend to medium-mass systems previous works exploring the coupling effects in
fusion reactions of both lighter and heavier systems. Results of
continuum-discretized coupled channel (CDCC) calculations indicate a small
enhancement of total fusion for the more weakly bound $^{6}$Li at sub-barrier
energies, with similar cross sections for both reactions at and above the
barrier. A systematic study of $^{4,6}$He induced fusion reactions with the
CDCC method is in progress. The understanding of the reaction dynamics
involving couplings to the breakup channels requires th explicit measurement of
precise elastic scattering data as well as yields leading to the breakup
itself. Recent coincidence experiments for $^{6,7}$Li + $^{59}$Co are
addressing this issue. The particle identification of the breakup products have
been achieved by measuring the three-body final-state correlations.

uniaxial MAE (K$_{1}$(T)) with magnetization (M(T)) $K_{1}(T) \sim
M(T)^{\gamma}$ characterized by the unusual exponent of $\gamma= 2.1$. It is
shown that this unusual behavior of the FePt can be quantitatively explained

the GE response to an inducing signal in a cell, measured by the amount of

type of response gives rise to a bimodal distribution in protein levels in an
ensemble of cells. One possible origin of binary response is cellular
bistability achieved through positive feedback or autoregulation. In this
paper, we study a simple, stochastic model of GE and show that the origin of
binary response lies exclusively in stochasticity. The transitions between the
active and inactive states of the gene are random in nature. Graded and binary
responses occur in the model depending on the relative stability of the
activated and deactivated gene states with respect to that of
mRNAs/proteins.The theoretical results on binary response provide a good

This excess can give rise to false positives due to competitive hybridization
of the wild type target at the mutation spot. The analysis of the DNA array
data is typically qualitative aiming to establish the presence or absence of a
particular point mutation. Our theoretical approach yields methods for
quantifying the analysis so as to obtain the ratio of concentrations of mutated
and wild type DNA. Method: The theory is formulated in terms of the
hybridization isotherms relating the hybridization fraction at the spot to the
composition of the sample solutions at thermodynamic equilibrium. It focuses on
samples containing an excess of single stranded DNA and on DNA arrays with low
surface density of probes. The hybridization equilibrium constants can be
obtained by the nearest neighbor method. Results: Two approaches allow us to
obtain quantitative results from the DNA array data. In one the signal of the
mutation spot is compared with that of the wild type spot. The implementation
requires knowledge of the saturation intensity of the two spots. The second
approach requires comparison of the intensity of the mutation spot at two
different temperatures. In this case knowledge of the saturation signal is not
always necessary. Conclusions: DNA arrays can be used to obtain quantitative
results on the concentration ratio of mutated DNA to wild type DNA in studies
of somatic point mutations.

  on Interdisciplinary Science (Natchitoches, Louisiana, October 2004)",,,,"quant-ph hep-ph hep-th",,"  Other than scattering problems where perturbation theory is applicable, there
are basically two ways to solve problems in physics. One is to reduce the
problem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in
terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem
combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then
becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics.
Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated
into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators
provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics,
including entanglement, decoherence, and Feynman's rest of the universe. In
addition, it is noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a
physics of harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the
Lorentz group which can be represented by the group of by two-by-two matrices
commonly called $SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can therefore
play the role of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. Both Paul
A. M. Dirac and Richard P. Feynman were fond of harmonic oscillators, while
they used different approaches to physical problems. Both were also keenly
interested in making quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity. It
is shown that the coupled harmonic oscillators can bridge these two different
approaches to physics.

a bosonic thermal bath. This is possible due to different initial temperatures
of the spin and the bath, both positive (no spin population inversion) and is
realized by means of a suitable sequence of sharp pulses applied to the spin.
The extracted work can be of the order of the response energy of the bath,
therefore much larger than the energy of the spin. Moreover, the efficiency of
extraction can be very close to its maximum, given by the Carnot bound, at the
same time the overall amount of the extracted work is maximal. Therefore, we
get a finite power at efficiency close to the Carnot bound.
  The effect comes from the backreaction of the spin on the bath, and it
survives for a strongly disordered (inhomogeneously broadened) ensemble of
spins. It is connected with generation of coherences during the work-extraction
process, and we derived it in an exactly solvable model. All the necessary
general thermodynamical relations are derived from the first principles of
quantum mechanics and connections are made with processes of lasing without
inversion and with quantum heat engines.
