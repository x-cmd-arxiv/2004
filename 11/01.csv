emission toward these three sources is unresolved at the 24'' SEST resolution
and likely originates from circumstellar accretion disks, each with estimated
dust masses of ~5x10**-5 Msun. Analysis of the visibility data toward HD107146

star within the astrometric uncertainties and resolved with a gaussian-fit FWHM
size of (6.5'' +/- 1.4'') x (4.2''+/-1.3''), or 185 AUx120 AU. The results from
our continuum survey are combined with published observations to quantify the
evolution of dust mass with time by comparing the mass distributions for
samples with different stellar ages. The frequency distribution of
circumstellar dust masses around solar-type stars in the Taurus molecular cloud
(age ~2 Myr) is distinguished from that around 3-10 Myr and 10-30 Myr old stars

gamma-ray burst remnants decelerating in either a homogeneous interstellar
medium or a stellar wind environment, taking into account the radiative loss of
the blast wave, which affects the temporal behaviors significantly. Inverse
Compton scattering is considered. The inverse Compton effect prolongs the
fast-cooling phase markedly, during which the relativistic shock is
semi-radiative and the radiation efficiency is approximately constant. It is
further shown that the shock is still semi-radiative for quite a long time
after it transits into the slow-cooling phase. The temporal decaying index of
the X-ray afterglow light curve in this semi-radiative phase is more consistent
with the observed $<\alpha_{X}> \sim 1.3$ than the commonly used adiabatic one.
To manifest as a bump or even dominant in the X-ray afterglows during the
relativistic stage, it is required that the density should be larger than about
1-10 cm$^{-3}$ in the interstellar medium case, or the wind parameter
$A_{\ast}$ should be larger than unity in the stellar wind case.

stars and QSOs), and radiative feedback. By constraining the free parameters
with available data on redshift evolution of Lyman-limit systems, Gunn-Peterson
and electron scattering optical depths, Near InfraRed Background (NIRB), and
cosmic star formation history, we select a fiducial model, whose main
predictions are: (i) H was completely reionized at z \approx 15, while HeII
must have been reionized by z \approx 12. At z \approx 7, HeIII suffered an
almost complete recombination as a result of the extinction of PopIII stars, as
required by the interpretation of the NIRB. (ii) A QSO-induced complete HeII
reionization occurs at z=3.5; a similar double H reionization does not take
place due to the large number of photons above 1 Ryd from PopII stars and QSOs,
even after PopIII stars have disappeared. (iii) Following reionization, the
temperature of the IGM corresponding to the mean gas density is boosted to
15000 K. Observations of T_0 are consistent with the fact that He is singly
ionized at z > 3.5, while they are consistent with He being doubly ionized at z
< 3.5. This might be interpreted as a signature of (second) HeII reionization.
(iv) Only 0.3% of the stars produced by z=2 need to be PopIII stars in order to
achieve the hydrogen reionization. Such model not only relieves the tension
between the Gunn-Peterson optical depth and WMAP observations, but also
accounts self-consistently for all known observational constraints (abridged).

that only for such a system, both kind of horizons, the electromagnetic and the
acoustic (generated due to transonicity of accreting fluid) are simultaneously

transition. If this is accomplished by decays of a massive particle, the reheat
temperature should be no more than a GeV, strongly constraining baryogenesis.
Cold dark matter may be composed of both axions, probed by direct detection,
and saxions, probed by a soft X-ray background arising from decays to \gamma
\gamma. There are two known possibilities for avoiding problematic axion domain
walls: the introduction of new colored fermions or the assumption that the
Peccei--Quinn symmetry was already broken during inflation. In the first case,
in our theory the colored particles are expected to be at the weak scale, while
in the second case it implies a good chance of discovering isocurvature
perturbations in the CMB radiation and a relatively low Hubble parameter during
inflation.

dimensions are the Killing vectors and the Killing-Yano tensors of any ranks.
The general theory of external symmetry transformations associated to the usual
isometries is presented, pointing out that these leave the standard Dirac
equation invariant providing the correct spin parts of the group generators.
Furthermore, one analyzes the new type of symmetries generated by the
covariantly constant Killing-Yano tensors that realize certain square roots of
the metric tensor. Such a Killing-Yano tensor produces simultaneously a
Dirac-type operator and the generator of a one-parameter Lie group connecting
this operator with the standard Dirac one. In this way the Dirac operators are
related among themselves through continuous transformations associated to
specific discrete ones. It is shown that the groups of this continuous symmetry
can be only U(1) or SU(2), as those of the (hyper-)Kahler spaces, but arising
even in cases when the requirements for these special geometries are not
fulfilled. To exemplify, the Euclidean Taub-NUT space with its Dirac-type
operators is presented in much details, pointing out that there is an

structure. As a final topic, we go to consider the properties of the Dirac-type

  When $X$ is an elliptic ruled surface with $e = -1$, there is an elliptic

new type, corresponding to a cross-parametric gain. The equation for the
fundamental-frequency (FF) wave may also contain a quadratic self-driving term,
which is generated by the cubic nonlinearity of the medium. Unlike previously
studied phase-matched models of chi^2 cavities driven at the second harmonic
(SH) or at FF, the present one admits an exact analytical solution for the
soliton, at a special value of the gain parameter. Two families of solitons are
found in a numerical form, and their stability area is identified through
numerical computation of the perturbation eigenvalues (stability of the zero
solution, which is a necessary condition for the soliton's stability, is
investigated in an analytical form). One family is a continuation of the
special analytical solution. At given values of parameters, one soliton is
stable and the other one is not; they swap their stability at a critical value
of the mismatch parameter. The stability of the solitons is also verified in
direct simulations, which demonstrate that the unstable pulse rearranges itself
into the stable one, or into a delocalized state, or decays to zero. A soliton
which was given an initial boost C starts to move but quickly comes to a halt,
if the boost is smaller than a critical value C_cr. If C>C_cr, the boost
destroys the soliton (sometimes, through splitting into two secondary pulses).
Interactions between initially separated solitons are investigated too. It is
concluded that stable solitons always merge into a single one. In the system
with weak loss, it appears in a vibrating form, slowly relaxing to the static
shape. With stronger loss, the final soliton emerges in the stationary form.

fusion reactions has emerged as a topic of considerable interest in the recent
years.
  Dissipative dynamical models based on the Langevin equation were developed
and were applied successfully for fission dynamics of highly excited heavy
nuclei. However, Wall Friction(WF), the standard version of nuclear friction
when incorporated in the Langevin dynamical model was not able to reproduce
simultaneously experimental data for both prescission neutron multiplicity and
fission probability. Consequently, an empirical reduction in the strength of
the wall friction was found necessary to reproduce the experimental numbers by
many workers. Interestingly, a modification of the wall friction was proposed
recently where the reduction was achieved microscopically. This modified
version is known as the chaos weighted wall friction(CWWF) which takes into
account non-integrability of single particle motion. The work in my thesis aims
at using this strongly shape dependent version of friction (CWWF) in the
Langevin dynamical model coupled with particle and gamma evaporation in order
to verify to what extent it can account for the experimental data of fission of
hot nuclei. The experimental data includes excitation functions of prescission
neutron multiplicity, fission probability as well as evaporation residue
cross-section of a number of nuclei. The importance of transients in nuclear
fission is also discussed. The present endeavour is an effort to obtain a clear
physical picture of nuclear dissipation which in turn will help in solving many
open problems related to collective motion, and in particular, nuclear fission.

dynamics of atomic cloud in a red-detuned lattice in a way that is not directly
expected from the MOT studies. The optical lattice and position dependent
light-matter coupling introduces selectivity of collision partners. Atoms,
which are most mobile and energetic, are strongly favored to participate in
collisions, and are more often ejected from the lattice, than the slow ones in
the laser parameter region selected for study. For blue-detuned lattices, we
study how optical shielding emerges as a natural part of the lattice and look
for ways to optimize the effect. The simulations are computationally very
demanding and would obviously benefit from the simplification schemes. We
present some steps to this direction by showing how it is possible to calculate

was previously applied to problems involving strong coupling between mechanics

discuss an enhancement of this formulation to account for migrating grain

an Eulerian framework where a grain boundary is represented as the zero level
set of an evolving higher-dimensional function. This approach can easily be
generalized to model other problems involving migrating interfaces; e.g. void
evolution and free-surface morphology evolution. The level-set equation is
recast in a remarkably simple form which obviates the need for spatial
stabilization techniques. This simplified level-set formulation makes use of
velocity extension and field re-initialization techniques. In addition, a
least-squares smoothing technique is used to compute the local curvature of a
grain boundary directly from the level-set field without resorting to
higher-order interpolation. A notable feature is that the coupling between mass
transport, mechanics and grain-boundary migration is fully accounted for. The
complexities associated with this coupling are highlighted and the
operator-split algorithm used to solve the coupled equations is described.

non-zero positive mutation rate gives qualitatively different results to the
traditional Penna model in which no positive mutations are considered. We find
that the high-lifespan tail of the distribution is radically changed in
structure, but that there is not much effect on the bulk of the population. Th
e mortality plateau that we found previously for a stochastic generalization of
the Penna model is stable to a small positive mutation rate.

flux across enzymes are diverse and exhibit power-law behavior in its
distribution. While one may guess that the reactions with larger fluxes are
more likely to be lethal under the blockade of its catalyzing gene products or
gene knockouts, we find, by in silico flux analysis, that the lethality rarely
has correlations with the flux level owing to the widespread backup pathways
innate in the genome-wide metabolism of \textit{Escherichia coli}. Lethal
reactions, of which the deletion generates cascading failure of following
reactions up to the biomass reaction, are identified in terms of the Boolean
network scheme as well as the flux balance analysis. The avalanche size of a
reaction, defined as the number of subsequently blocked reactions after its
removal, turns out to be a useful measure of lethality. As a means to elucidate
phenotypic robustness to a single deletion, we investigate synthetic lethality
in reaction level, where simultaneous deletion of a pair of nonlethal reactions
leads to the failure of the biomass reaction. Synthetic lethals identified via
flux balance and Boolean scheme are consistently shown to act in parallel
pathways, working in such a way that the backup machinery is compromised.

The long time behaviour of population is therefore likely to be dominated by
the modes with the largest time constants. We confirm our analytical approach

wave behaviour in a particle framework. In this paper we show that the phase
itself can have a physical origin in time reversal, and that the propagator can
be drawn by a single deterministic path.

neighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial for any
finite time interval $T$. The topological interpretation of Berry's phase such
as the topological proof of phase-change rule thus fails in the practical
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where a large but finite ratio of two time
scales is involved.
