  Moffat, ASP Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations of the Arches cluster located within a projected distance
of 30 pc from the dynamical center of the Galaxy have shown the presence of
diffuse and discrete X-ray continuum emission, diffuse 6.4keV line emission as
well as thermal and nonthermal radio continuum emission. This young and dense
stellar cluster is also recognized to be within the 95% error circle of an
identified steady source of $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the EGRET
source 3EG J1746--2851. Much of the thermal and nonthermal emission can be
explained by shocked gas resulting from colliding winds originating from
massive binaries within the cluster. In particular, we argue that nonthermal
particles could upscatter the radiation field of the cluster by ICS and account
for the $\gamma$-ray emission. We also consider that the fluorescent 6.4 keV
line emission may be the result of the impact of low-energy relativistic
particles on neutral gas distributed in the vicinity of the cluster. Lastly, we
sketch an interpretation in which young stellar clusters and massive young
binary systems are responsible for the origin of nonthermal radio filaments
found throughout the inner 300pc of the Galaxy. The collimation of the
nonthermal filaments may be done in the colliding wind region by the ionized
surface of individual mass-losing stars of massive binary systems. In this
picture, a WR-type phenomenon is expected to power a central star burst in the
Galactic center in order to account for all the observed filaments.

of the higher accretion rate maintains its initial anisotropic shape even after

The steepness of the luminosity--temperature (LT) relation, $L_{\rm

$\alpha=3.17\pm0.15$, consistent with previous measurements. In the relation,

$\alpha=2.34\pm0.29$ above 4 keV, $3.74\pm0.32$ in 1.5--5 keV, and
$4.03\pm1.07$ below 1.5 keV. Such two breaks are also evident in the
temperature and size relation. The steepness in the LT relation at $kT>4$ keV
is consistent with the scale-relation derived from the CDM model, indicating
that the gravitational effect is dominant in richer clusters, while poorer
clusters suffer non-gravity effects. The steep LT relation below 1 keV is
almost attributed to X-ray faint systems of elliptical galaxies and galaxy

the relation of $M_{\rm gas}\propto T^{2.33\pm0.07}$ from X-ray faint galaxies

n-dimensional reduction for processes in QCD which have an additional mass
scale. Examples are heavy flavour production in hadron-hadron collisions or
on-shell photon-hadron collisions where the scale is represented by the mass
$m$. Another example is electroproduction of heavy flavours where we have two
mass scales given by $m$ and the virtuality of the photon $Q=\sqrt{-q^2}$.
Finally we study the Drell-Yan process where the additional scale is
represented by the virtuality $Q=\sqrt{q^2}$ of the vector boson ($\gamma^*, W,
Z$). The difference between the two schemes is not accounted for by the usual
oversubtractions. There are extra counter terms which multiply the mass scale
dependent parts of the Born cross sections. In the case of the Drell-Yan
process it turns out that the off-shell mass regularization agrees with
n-dimensional regularization.

  immortal strand segregation mechanisms","9 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.71.041914",,"q-bio.TO q-bio.PE",,"  This paper develops a point-mutation model describing the evolutionary
dynamics of a population of adult stem cells. Such a model may prove useful for
quantitative studies of tissue aging and the emergence of cancer. We consider
two modes of chromosome segregation: (1) Random segregation, where the daughter
chromosomes of a given parent chromosome segregate randomly into the stem cell
and its differentiating sister cell. (2) ``Immortal DNA strand''
co-segregation, for which the stem cell retains the daughter chromosomes with
the oldest parent strands. Immortal strand co-segregation is a mechanism,
originally proposed by Cairns (J. Cairns, {\it Nature} {\bf 255}, 197 (1975)),
by which stem cells preserve the integrity of their genomes. For random
segregation, we develop an ordered strand pair formulation of the dynamics,
analogous to the ordered strand pair formalism developed for quasispecies
dynamics involving semiconservative replication with imperfect lesion repair
(in this context, lesion repair is taken to mean repair of postreplication
base-pair mismatches). Interestingly, a similar formulation is possible with
immortal strand co-segregation, despite the fact that this segregation
mechanism is age-dependent. From our model we are able to mathematically show
that, when lesion repair is imperfect, then immortal strand co-segregation
leads to better preservation of the stem cell lineage than random chromosome
segregation. Furthermore, our model allows us to estimate the optimal lesion
repair efficiency for preserving an adult stem cell population for a given
period of time. For human stem cells, we obtain that mispaired bases still
present after replication and cell division should be left untouched, to avoid
potentially fixing a mutation in both DNA strands.

  Parameter Perturbation","6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table submitted to Nucleic Acids Research",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.BM",,"  Computational RNA secondary structure prediction is rather well established.
However, such prediction algorithms always depend on a large number of
experimentally measured parameters. Here, we study how sensitive structure
prediction algorithms are to changes in these parameters. We find that already
for changes corresponding to the actual experimental error to which these
parameters have been determined 30% of the structure are falsly predicted and
the ground state structure is preserved under parameter perturbation in only 5%
of all cases. We establish that base pairing probabilities calculated in a
thermal ensemble are a viable though not perfect measure for the reliability of
the prediction of individual structure elements. A new measure of stability
using parameter perturbation is proposed, and its limitations discussed.

Physical Review Letters (in press)",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.268107",,"q-bio.BM q-bio.QM",,"  Finite size effects on the cooperative thermal denaturation of proteins are
considered. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, Omega, scales as N^zeta,
where N is the number of amino acids. Surprisingly, we find that zeta is
universal with zeta = 1 + gamma, where the exponent gamma characterizes the
divergence of the susceptibility for a self-avoiding walk. Our lattice model
simulations and experimental data are consistent with the theory. Our finding
rationalizes the marginal stability of proteins and substantiates the earlier
predictions that the efficient folding of two-state proteins requires the
folding transition temperature to be close to the collapse temperature.
