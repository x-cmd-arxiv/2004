D","Phys.Rev. D71 (2005) 083501","10.1103/PhysRevD.71.083501",,"astro-ph",,"  One of the principal goals of modern cosmology is to constrain the properties
of dark energy. At present, numerous surveys are aiming to determine the
equation of state, which is assumed constant due to our poor understanding of
its behaviour (and since higher order parameterisations lead to unwieldy
errors). This raises the question - how does our ""best-fit"" equation of state
relate to the true function, which may vary with redshift. Saini et al. have
demonstrated that the value of w attained by a supernovae study is well
described by a weighted integral over the true function. Adopting a similar
approach, we calculate the corresponding ""weight function"" for a fiducial
cosmic shear survey. We disentangle contributions from the angular diameter
distance and the growth factor, finding that they partially cancel each other
out. Consequentially, the sensitivity to w at high redshift is enhanced beyond
that of supernovae studies, and is comparable, if not higher, than lensing of
the CMB. This illustrates the comlementary nature of the different techniques.
Furthermore, we find that results which would naively be interpreted as
inconsistent could arise from a time-dependent equation of state.

by modelling the moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of stars
obtained from new velocity data of Wilkinson et al. The luminosity distribution
is approximated by a Sersic profile fitted to the data by Odenkirchen et al. We
assume that the dark matter density profile is given by a formula with an inner
cusp and an outer exponential cut-off, as recently proposed by Kazantzidis et
al. as a result of simulations of tidal stripping of dwarfs by the potential of
the Milky Way. The dark matter distribution is characterized by the total dark
mass and the cut-off radius. The models have arbitrary velocity anisotropy
parameter assumed to be constant with radius. We estimate the three parameters
by fitting both the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles,
which allows us to break the degeneracy between the mass distribution and
velocity anisotropy. The results of the fitting procedure turn out to be very
different depending on the stellar sample considered, that is on our choice of
stars with discrepant velocities to be discarded as interlopers. For our most
reliable sample, the model parameters remain weakly constrained, but the robust
result is the preference for weakly tangential stellar orbits and high
mass-to-light ratios. The best-fitting total mass is then 7 10^7 M_sun, much
lower than recent estimates, while the mass-to-light ratio is M/L_V = 300 and
almost constant with radius. If the binary fraction in the stellar population
of Draco turns out to be significant, the kurtosis of the global velocity
distribution will be smaller and the orbits inferred will be more tangential,
while the resulting mass estimate lower.

transfer in this system operates via the Roche lobe overflow mechanism, but the
material transferred from the normal companion is neither accreted onto the
surface of the white dwarf nor stored in a disk around its magnetosphere. As
previously shown, such a situation can be realized if the white dwarf operates
as a propeller. At the same time, the efficiency of the propeller action by the
white dwarf is insufficient to explain the rapid braking of the white dwarf,
which implies that the spin-down power is in excess of the bolometric
luminosity of the system. To avoid this problem we have simulated the
mass-transfer process in AE Aqr assuming that the observed braking of the white
dwarf is governed by a pulsar-like spin-down mechanism. We show that the
expected H_alpha Doppler tomogram in this case resembles the tomogram observed
from the system. We find that the agreement between the simulated and the
observed tomograms is rather good provided the mean value of the mass-transfer
rate <\dot{M}> ~5x10^16 g/s. Three spatially separated sources of H_alpha
emission can be distinguished within this approach. The structure of the
tomogram depends on the relative contributions of these sources to the H_alpha
emission and is expected to vary from night to night.

that the projection degeneracy affecting a pure power spectrum analysis in

possible role of the coorbital torques in affecting migration rates. We analyse
two cases: (a) a Jupiter-mass planet in a low-mass disc and (b) a Saturn-mass
planet in a high-mass disc. Planet migration in case (b) is much more
susceptible to coorbital torques than in case (a). We find that the coorbital
torques in both cases do not depend sensitively on whether the planet is
allowed to migrate through the disc or is held on a fixed orbit. We also
examine the dependence of the planet's migration rate on the numerical
resolution near the planet. For case (a), numerical convergence is relatively
easy to obtain, even when including torques arising from deep within the
planet's Hill sphere. The migration rate in this case is numerically on order
of the Type II migration rate and much smaller than the Type I rate, if the
disc has 0.01 solar-masses inside 26 AU. Torques from within the Hill sphere
provide a substantial opposing contribution to the migration rate. In case (b),
the gas mass within the Hill sphere is larger than the planet's mass and
convergence is more difficult to obtain. If the torques within the Hill sphere
are ignored, convergence is more easily achieved but the migration rate is
artificially large. At our highest resolution, the migration rate for case (b)
is much less than the Type I rate, but somewhat larger than the Type II rate.

extended for resistive MHD equations. We carried out simulations up to 50
rotation period at the innermost radius of the disk created by accretion from
the torus. The acceleration forces and the characteristics of resistive jets
were studied by computing forces acting on Lagrangian test particles. Since the
angle between the rotation axis of the disk and magnetic field lines is smaller
in resistive models than in ideal MHD models, magnetocentrifugal acceleration
is smaller. The effective potential along a magnetic field line has maximum
around $z \sim 0.5r_0$ in resistive models, where $r_0$ is the radius where the
density of the initial torus is maximum. Jets are launched after the disk
material is lifted to this height by pressure gradient force. Even in this

dz/(1+z) = 0.03 will detect the acoustic oscillations with 99.9% confidence,
measuring the associated preferred cosmological scale with 2% precision. Such a
survey will also detect the turnover with 95% confidence, determining the
corresponding scale with 20% accuracy. (2) By assuming a Lambda-CDM model power
spectrum we calculate the confidence with which a non-zero baryon fraction can
be deduced from such future galaxy surveys. We quantify 'wiggle detection' by
calculating the number of standard deviations by which the baryon fraction is
measured, after marginalizing over the shape parameter. This is typically a
factor of four more significant (in terms of number of standard deviations)
than the 'model-independent' result. We conclude that the precision with which
the clustering pattern may be inferred from future photometric redshift surveys
will be competitive with contemporaneous spectroscopic redshift surveys,
assuming that systematic effects can be controlled. We also note that an
analysis of Luminous Red Galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey may yield a
marginal detection of acoustic oscillations in the imaging survey, in addition
to that recently reported for the spectroscopic component.

13 per cent of Eddington, and the optical depth of the hard X-ray source larger
by factor ~2. Its broad-band X-ray spectrum can be modelled by three
components. We interpret the two soft components as thermal emission from a
colder (kT ~ 0.6 keV) accretion disc and a hotter (~1 keV) spot on the neutron
star surface. We interpret the hard component as thermal Comptonization in
plasma of temperature ~40 keV and optical depth of ~1.5 in a slab geometry. The
plasma is heated by the accretion shock as the material collimated by the
magnetic field impacts on to the surface. The seed photons for Comptonization
are provided by the hotspot, not by the disc. The Compton reflection is weak
and the disc is probably truncated into an optically thin flow above the
magnetospheric radius. Rotation of the emission region with the star creates an
almost sinusoidal pulse profile with rms amplitude of 3.3 per cent. The
energy-dependent soft phase lags can be modelled by two pulsating components
shifted in phase, which is naturally explained by a different character of
emission of the optically thick spot and optically thin shock combined with the
action of the Doppler boosting.

mass in molecular hydrogen. These results thus fit the simple picture in which
the cold dust is heated predominantly by the interstellar radiation field while
the hot dust is heated predominantly by OB stars in more active regions,

120+/-60, very similar to that found within our own galaxy and roughly a factor
of 10 lower than that derived from IRAS data alone. The gas-to-dust ratios in
the warm, molecular component are on average higher than those in the cold,

velocity data from the hydrodynamical simulation to advect an initially random

emission from a propagating region of magnetic field, `ordered' by the shock,
and lying approximately transverse to the flow direction, merges with that from
an evolving sheared region at the flow periphery. If such a flow were barely

particular, we find three U(1) spin liquid phases with different short-range
magnetic correlations. These phases are characterized by deconfined gapped
spinons, gapped monopoles, and gapless ``photons''. As N becomes smaller, a
confinement transition from these phases to valence bond solids (VBS) may
occur. This transition is studied by using duality and analyzing the resulting
theory of monopoles coupled to a non-compact dual gauge field; the condensation
of the monopoles leads to VBS phases. We determine the resulting VBS phases
emerging from two of the three spin liquid states. On the other hand, the spin
liquid state near J_1 \approx J_2 appears to be more stable against monopole
condensation and could be a promising candidate for a spin liquid state in real
systems.

hydrodynamic expansion in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In this interpretation,
different hadron species emerge from a common medium that has built up a strong
collective velocity field. Here, we show that the existence of a collective
flow field implies characteristic modifications of high-pT parton
fragmentation. We generalize the formalism of parton energy loss to the case of
flow-induced, oriented momentum transfer. We also discuss how to embed this
calculation in hydrodynamic simulations. Flow effects are found to result
generically in characteristic asymmetries in the eta-phi-plane of jet energy
distributions and of multiplicity distributions associated to high-pT trigger
particles. But collective flow also contributes to the medium-induced
suppression of single inclusive high-pT hadron spectra. In particular, we find
that low-pT elliptic flow can induce a sizeable additional contribution to the
high-pT azimuthal asymmetry by selective elimination of those hard partons
which propagate with significant inclination against the flow field. This
reduces at least partially the recently observed problem that models of parton
energy loss tend to underpredict the large azimuthal asymmetry v2 of high-pT
hadronic spectra in semi-peripheral Au+Au collisions.

that radiation of photons is possible only when the sign of the particle

a result, the active left-handed polarized neutrino (right-handed polarized

practically ``sterile''. Since the sign of the effective potential depends on
the neutrino flavor and the matter structure, the ``spin light'' can change a
ratio of active neutrinos of different flavors. In the ultra relativistic
approach, the radiated photons averaged energy is equal to one third of the
initial neutrino energy, and two thirds of the energy are carried out by the
final ``sterile'' neutrinos. This fact can be important for the understanding
of the ``dark matter'' formation mechanism on the early stages of evolution of

contribution to the decay amplitude in a region of the phase space which is
around the point where all decay products have energy $\sim m_b/3$ in the rest
frame of the $B$-meson. At lowest order in 1/Q, where $Q$ is of order $m_b$,
the $B\to K \gamma\gamma$ matrix element is then expressed in terms of the
usual $B\to K$ form factors known from semileptonic rare decays. The integrated
SD branching ratio in the SM in the OPE region turns out to be $\Delta
{\cal{B}}(B \to K \gamma \gamma)_{SM}^{OPE} \simeq 1 \times 10^{-9}$. We work
out the di-photon invariant mass distribution with and without the resonant
background through $B\to K \{\eta_c,\chi_{c0}\}\to K\gamma \gamma$. In the SM,
the resonance contribution is dominant in the region of phase space where the
OPE is valid. The present experimental upper limit on $B_s \to \tau^+ \tau^-$
decays, which constrains the scalar/pseudoscalar Four-Fermi operators with
$\tau^+ \tau^-$, leaves considerable room for new physics in the
one-particle-irreducible contribution to $B\to K \gamma \gamma$ decays. In this

enhanced by one order of magnitude with respect to its SM value and the SD

  The pentagonal number theorem is that $\prod_{n=1}^\infty
(1-x^n)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^n x^{n(3n-1)/2}$. This paper assumes the
pentagonal number theorem and uses it to prove a recurrence relation for the
sum of divisors function. The term ""pentagonal numbers"" comes from polygonal
numbers. Euler takes the logarithmic derivative of both sides. Then after
multiplying both sides by $-x$, the left side is equal to $\sum_{n=1}^\infty
\sigma(n) x^n$, where $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of the divisors of $n$, e.g.
$\sigma(6)=12$. This then leads to the recurrence relation for $\sigma(n)$.
  I have been studying in detail all of Euler's work on the pentagonal number
theorem, and more generally infinite products. I would be particularly
interested to see if anyone else worked with products and series like these
between Euler and Jacobi, and I would enjoy hearing from anyone who knows

weak interactions between hadrons. The photon polarization $P_\gamma$ in the
unpolarized neutron capture process and photon asymmetry $A_\gamma$ in the

showed an excellent agreement between simulated and experimental data:
experimental spatial resolutions were predicted with an error less than 100 mu

momentum tensor and equations of motion are derived from the fields. In this
way the theory of continua is shown to have the same form as other field
theories, such as electromagnetism and general relativity.
  Waves are treated as an example of the power of field theoretic methods. The
average or background flow and the waves are considered as two interacting
components of the system. The wave-background interaction involves the transfer
of energy and momentum between the waves and the average flow, but the total
energy and momentum are conserved. The average Lagrangian for the total
wave-background system is found by expanding the Lagrangian about the
background flow and averaging over the phase. The total energy-momentum tensor
is constructed, and the conservation of energy and momentum are discussed.
Varying the wave amplitude gives the dispersion and polarization relations for
the waves, and varying the phase gives the rays and conservation of wave quanta
(or wave action). The wave quanta move with the group velocity along the
bi-characteristic rays.

ADAR substrates are known, while indirect evidence suggests a substantial
