from the very massive stars in the Carina nebula, and possibly Eta Car itself.
We investigate both the nebular and stellar content of the object. Near-IR
emission-line images reveal a cavity inside the head of the dust pillar, which
contains a dense cluster of young stars, while the observed spectrum of the
nebula is consistent with an H II region ionized by an O9.5 V star. After
subtracting contamination of field stars within the Carina nebula itself, we
compare the cluster's color magnitude diagram with pre-main-sequence isochrones
to derive a likely cluster age less than about 0.1 Myr. This is in reasonable
agreement with the dynamical age of a few times 10^4 yr for the expanding

the propagation of light plays the major role, in the new theory it is the
expansion of the Universe that takes that role and appears at the outset. The

We consider two scenarios for particle injection: (i) particles injected at the

subsequently by the stochastic process in the downstream region; and (ii)
particles injected uniformly throughout the downstream region to the stochastic
process. We show that regardless of the injection scenario, depending on the
magnetic field strength, plasma composition, and the employed turbulence model,
the stochastic mechanism can have considerable effects on the particle spectrum
on temporal and spatial scales too short to be resolved in extragalactic jets.
Stochastic acceleration is shown to be able to produce spectra that are
significantly flatter than the limiting case of particle energy spectral index
-1 of the first order mechanism. Our study also reveals a possibility of
re-acceleration of the stochastically accelerated spectrum at the shock, as
particles at high energies become more and more mobile as their mean free path
increases with energy. Our findings suggest that the role of the second order
mechanism in the turbulent downstream of a relativistic shock with respect to
the first order mechanism at the shock front has been underestimated in the
past, and that the second order mechanism may have significant effects on the
form of the particle spectra and its evolution.

distinguishing long-timescale microlensing events from long-period stellar
variables. The basis of the selection algorithm is the fitting of the
superpixel lightcurves to two different theoretical models, using variable star
and blended microlensing templates. Only if microlensing is preferred is an
event retained as a possible candidate. Further cuts are made with regard to

In the first case in which the forming galaxy has already virialized, the
impinging shock has only a small effect (< 1% of the gas is removed) and star
formation continues relatively unimpeded. However, in the second case in which
the nearby forming galaxy is at the more diffuse turn-around stage, a large
fraction (~70%) of the gas is stripped away from the host dark-matter halo and
ejected into the intergalactic medium. As the time spent near turn-around is
much longer than the interval from virialization to galaxy formation due to
strong radiative losses, we expect the second case to be more representative of
the majority of outflow-galaxy interactions. Thus SN-driven pregalactic
outflows may be an efficient mechanism for inhibiting the formation of
neighbouring galaxies at high redshift. We briefly outline the possible
cosmological consequences of this effect.

affects the structure of the envelopes of luminous asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars in the phase of ``hot bottom burning '' (HBB). We stress that this
important uncertainty in the modeling plays a role which is much more dramatic
than the role which can be ascribed, e.g., to the uncertainty in the nuclear
cross-sections. Due to the role tentatively attributed today to the HBB
nucleosynthesis as the site of self-enrichment of Globular Clusters stars, it
is necessary to explore the difference in nucleosynthesis obtained by different
prescriptions for convection. We present results of detailed evolutionary
calculations of the evolution of stars of intermediate mass during the AGB
phase. We follow carefully the nucleosynthesis at the base of the external
convective region, showing that very different results can be obtained
according to the presciption adopted to find out the temperature gradient
within the instability regions. We discuss the uncertainties in the yields of
the various chemical species and the role which these sources can play as
polluters of the interstellar medium.

steeper than most cluster IMFs, which have slopes close to the Salpeter value.
Local field regions of star formation, like Taurus, may have relatively steep
IMFs too. Very dense and massive clusters, like super star clusters, could have
flatter IMFs, or inner-truncated IMFs. We propose that these variations are the
result of three distinct processes during star formation that affect the mass
function in different ways depending on mass range. At solar to intermediate
stellar masses, gas processes involving thermal pressure and supersonic
turbulence determine the basic scale for stellar mass, starting with the
observed pre-stellar condensations, and they define the mass function from
several tenths to several solar masses. Brown dwarfs require extraordinarily
high pressures for fragmentation from the gas, and presumably form inside the
pre-stellar condensations during mutual collisions, secondary fragmentations,
or in disks. High mass stars form in excess of the numbers expected from pure
turbulent fragmentation as pre-stellar condensations coalesce and accrete with
an enhanced gravitational cross section. Variations in the interaction rate,
interaction strength, and accretion rate among the primary fragments formed by
turbulence lead to variations in the relative proportions of brown dwarfs,
solar to intermediate mass stars, and high mass stars.

magnetization at zero temperature : for $\rho(J) \sim A | J |^{\mu-1}$ near $J
\to 0$, the magnetization follows the Chen-Ma scaling $M \sim h^{\mu/(2+\mu)}$.
In this paper, we numerically revisit this model to obtain detailed statistical
information on the ground state configuration and on the low-energy two-level
excitations that govern the low temperature properties. The ground state
consists of long unfrustrated intervals separated by weak frustrated bonds: We
accordingly compute the strength distribution of these frustrated bonds, as
well as the length- and magnetization- distributions of the unfrustrated
intervals. We find that the low-energy excitations are of two types (i) one
frustrated bond of the ground state may have two positions that are nearly
degenerate in energy (ii) two neighboring frustrated bonds of the ground state
may be annihilated or created with nearly zero energy cost. For each excitation
type, we compute its probability density as a function of its length. We
moreover show that the contributions of these excitations to various
observables (specific heat, Edwards-Anderson order parameter, susceptibility)
are in full agreement with direct transfer matrix evaluations at low
temperature. Finally, following the special bimodal case $\pm J$, where a
Ma-Dasgupta RG procedure has been previously used to compute explicitly the
above observables, we discuss the possibility of an extended RG procedure : we
find that the ground state can be seen as the result of a hierarchical
`fragmentation' procedure that we describe.

interface level. A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is
currently being deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not
examined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a
network-friendly manner. In this paper we make two contributions toward that
end. First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter)
are quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces. This is a
concern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic
that they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure two kinds of
redundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are
important. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two
kinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in
conflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an
algorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and
end systems. The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to
and from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe
each path by starting near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can
reduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while
permitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links. We then show
how to enable efficient communication between monitors through the use of Bloom

several pulsars. Freely precessing pulsars radiate gravitationally at
frequencies near the rotation rate and twice the rotation rate, which for
rotation frequencies greater than $\sim 10$ Hz is in the LIGO band. In older
work, the gravitational wave spectrum of a precessing neutron star has been
evaluated to first order in a small precession angle. Here we calculate the
contributions to second order in the wobble angle, and we find that a new
spectral line emerges. We show that for reasonable wobble angles, the
second-order line may well be observable with the proposed advanced LIGO
detector for precessing neutron stars as far away as the galactic center.
Observation of the full second-order spectrum permits a direct measurement of
the star's wobble angle, oblateness, and deviation from axisymmetry, with the
potential to significantly increase our understanding of neutron star
structure.

two-dimensional quantum field theories by means of semiclassical techniques.
These achievements represent a natural development of the non-perturbative
studies performed in the past years for conformally invariant and integrable
theories, which have led to analytical predictions for several measurable
quantities in the universality classes of statistical systems. Here we propose
a semiclassical method to control analytically the spectrum and the finite-size
effects in both integrable and non-integrable theories. The techniques used are
appropriate generalizations of the ones introduced in seminal works during the
Seventies by Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu and by Goldstone and Jackiw. Their
approaches, which do not require integrability and therefore can be applied to
a large class of systems, are best suited to deal with those quantum field
theories characterized by a non-linear interaction potential with different
degenerate minima. In fact, these systems display kink excitations which
generally have a large mass in the small coupling regime. Under these
circumstances, although the results obtained are based on a small coupling
assumption, they are nevertheless non-perturbative, since the kink backgrounds
around which the semiclassical expansion is performed are non-perturbative too.

relative conservation laws define in turn relative conserved quantities which
measure, for example, how much energy is needed in a field theory to go from
one configuration (called the reference or vacuum) to another configuration
(the physical state of the system). The general prescription we describe solves
in a covariant way the well known observer dependence of conserved quantities.
The solution found is deeply related to the divergence ambiguity of the
Lagrangian and to various formalisms recently appeared in literature to deal
with the variation of conserved quantities (of which this is a formal
integration). A number of examples relevant to fundamental Physics are

the freeness of the integral cohomology of the Hilbert modular variety over

conceived as an algebraic framework for the Kauffman link invariant. They also
appear as centralizer algebras for representations of quantum universal
enveloping algebras of orthogonal or symplectic types.
  It was shown by Morton and Wassermann that the BMW algebras are isomorphic to
algebras of tangles in (disc $\times$ interval), modulo Kauffman skein
relations. This isomorphism allows one to see very clearly certain properties
of the BMW algebras -- for example existence of Markov traces and conditional
expectations and a good basis.
  In the present work, we establish the correponding results for affine BMW
algebras, showing they are isomorphic to algebras of tangles in (annulus
$\times$ interval), modulo Kaufffman skein relations. Again, this provides an
important foundation for studying these algebras, as the existence of Markov
traces and conditional expectations are consequences of the isomorphism.
Moreover, we obtain a basis of the affine BMW algebras analogous to a well
known basis of the affine Hecke algebras.

equation y_xx = F(x,y,y_x) to be equivalent, through a point transformation

This result, preliminary to the deep group-theoretic classification of second
order analytic ordinary differential equations, was parachieved later in 1896
by Arthur Tresse, a French student of S. Lie. In the present paper, following
closely the original strategy of proof of S. Lie, which we firstly expose and
restitute in length, we generalize this explicit characterization to the case
of several second order ordinary differential equations. Let K=R or C, or more
generally any field of characteristic zero equipped with a valuation, so that
K-analytic functions make sense. Let x in K, let m > 1, let y := (y^1, ...,
y^m) in K^m and let y_xx^j = F^j(x,y,y_x^l), j = 1,...,m be a collection of m
analytic second order ordinary differential equations, in general nonlinear. We
provide an explicit necessary and sufficient condition in order that this
system is equivalent, under a point transformation (x, y^1, ..., y^m) -->
(X(x,y), Y^1(x,y),..., Y^m(x, y)), to the Newtonian free particle system Y_XX^1
= ... = Y_XX^m = 0. Strikingly, the (complicated) differential system that we
obtain is of first order in the case m > 1, whereas it is of second order in S.

of the system and conserved small negative fraction of the isospin-charge. We
find strange baryons as well as kaons are produced abundantly when the

there is no signature for the onset of kaon condensation in the relativistic

on the angular momentum of the resonance states. In this context the existence
of so-called quasi-bound states is shown. In order to approximately calculate
the resonance energies of such states a radial Schr\""odinger equation is
derived which improves the well-known adiabatic approximation. The effects of

by a pre-post-test design. In addition to videotaping the lessons, knowledge
and motivational tests as well as student interviews, students were asked to
prepare concept maps, which were used to track processes of model construction.
The way this knowledge was applied largely depends on the students'
understanding of models. In particular it was shown that the participating
students' demonstrated capacity for distinguishing between the different models
of light is of great importance. Only students with a developed capacity for
distinguishing between models are able to reason in an problem-oriented manner.
They recognize the limits of models and are not only able to specifically
designate changes from models and levels of models, but also to apply these in
