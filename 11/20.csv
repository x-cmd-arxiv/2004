cosmological nonlinear matter clustering to include the effect of massive

of neutrino clustering for three degenerate mass neutrinos with m_nu=0.9 eV is
of order ~1%, within the potential sensitivity of upcoming weak lensing
surveys. In order to use these measurements to further constrain--or eventually
detect--neutrino masses, accurate theoretical predictions of the nonlinear
power spectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos will be needed, likely only
possible through high-resolution multiple particle (neutrino, CDM and baryon)

emission L_\nu. The gCFL phase is characterized by an unusual quasiparticle
dispersion relation that makes both its specific heat c_V and its neutrino
emissivity epsilon_\nu parametrically larger than in any other phase of nuclear
or quark matter. During the epoch in which the cooling of the star is dominated
by direct Urca neutrino emission, the presence of a gCFL region does not
strongly alter the cooling history because the enhancements of C_V and L_\nu
cancel against each other. At late times, however, the cooling is dominated by
photon emission from the surface, so L_\nu is irrelevant, and the anomalously
large heat capacity of the gCFL region keeps the star warm. The temperature
drops with time as T\sim t^{-1.4} rather than the canonical T\sim t^{-5}. This
provides a unique and potentially observable signature of gCFL quark matter.

radio imaging, reaching well into the sub-100 microJy level. One of the aims of
this survey is to characterize the sub-mJy radio population, exploring its
nature and evolution. In this paper we present the catalog and results of the
spectroscopic observations aimed at characterizing the optically ``bright''
(R<~ 21.5 mag) counterparts of faint radio sources. Out of 371 sources with
redshift determination, 21% have absorption lines only, 11% show AGN
signatures, 32% are star-forming galaxies, 34% show narrow emission lines that
do not allow detailed spectral classification (due to poor signal-to-noise
ratio and/or lack of diagnostic emission lines) and the remaining 2% are
identified with stars. For the star-forming galaxies with a Balmer decrement
measurement we find a median extinction of A(Ha)=1.9 mag, higher than that of
optically selected samples. This is a result of the radio selection, which is
not biased against dusty systems. Using the available spectroscopic
information, we estimate the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxies
in two independent redshift bins at z~0.1 and 0.3 respectively. We find direct
evidence for strong luminosity evolution of these systems consistent with L(1.4
GHz) ~ (1+z)^(2.7).

suggests a quantisation condition on the available conformal time. This
condition implies that the universe is closed at no greater than the 10% level.
When a massive scalar field is introduced to drive an inflationary phase this
figure is reduced to closure at nearer the 1% level. In order to enforce the
constraint on the available conformal time we need to consider conditions in
the universe before the onset of inflation. A formal series around the initial
singularity is constructed, which rests on a pair of dimensionless,
scale-invariant parameters. For physically-acceptable models we find that both
parameters are of order unity, so no fine tuning is required, except in the
mass of the scalar field. For typical values of the input parameters we predict
the observed values of the cosmological parameters, including the magnitude of
the cosmological constant. The model produces a very good fit to the most
recent CMBR data, predicting a low-l fall-off in the CMB power spectrum
consistent with that observed by WMAP.

locally blackbody, we show how the observed spectrum depends on the spin of the
black hole, the inclination of the disk, and the torque at the inner edge of
the disk. We find that the effect of a nonzero torque on the spectrum can, to a
good approximation, be absorbed into a zero-torque model by adjusting the mass
accretion rate and the normalization. We describe a computer model, called
KERRBB, which we have developed for fitting the spectra of black hole X-ray

N-body simulation and models for the baryonic component of the galaxy. The lens
caustics, critical curves, image locations and magnification ratios are
calculated by ray-shooting on an adaptive grid. When the source is near a cusp
in a smooth lens' caustic the sum of the magnifications of the three closest
images should be close to zero. It is found that in the observed cases this sum
is generally too large to be consistent with the simulations implying that
there is not enough substructure in the simulations. This suggests that other
factors play an important role. These may include limited numerical resolution,
lensing by structure outside the halo, selection bias and the possibility that
a randomly selected galaxy halo may be more irregular, for example due to
recent mergers, than the isolated halo used in this study. It is also shown
that, with the level of substructure computed from the N-body simulations, the
image magnifications of the Einstein cross type lenses are very weak functions
of source size up to $\sim 1\kpc$. This is also true for the magnification
ratios of widely separated images in the fold and cusp caustic lenses. This
means that selected magnification ratios for different the emission regions of
a lensed quasar should agree with each other, barring microlensing by stars.
The source size dependence of the magnification ratio between the closest pair
of images is more sensitive to substructure.

between Forbush recovery times and CME transit time that contradicts the
predictions of simple cosmic ray diffusive barrier models. The anti-correlation
suggests that the decay rate of ICMEs is anti-correlated with their travel
speed. Forbush recovery times range from seven times the transit time for the
fastest disturbance to a fifth the Sun-Earth transit time for the slowest. To
account for the large range of measured recovery times we infer that the
slowest disturbances must decay rapidly with radius whereas the fastest ones
must remain strong. The longest recovery times suggest that the fastest
disturbances in our sample decayed less rapidly with radius than the ambient
solar wind magnetic field strength.

North nucleus as the position of one of the two AGNs. Within the South nucleus,
the northern sub-nucleus is more highly reddened. Based upon the nuclear
separation measured at 5 GHz, we suggest that the AGN in the South nucleus is

the brightest point in K' band. Within the South nucleus there is strong H2 1-0
S(1) line emission from the northern sub-nucleus, contrary to the conclusions
of previous seeing-limited observations. Narrowband H2 emission-line images
show that a streamer or ribbon of excited molecular hydrogen connects the North

of gas connecting the two nuclei, as seen in computer simulations of mergers.
Many point-like regions are seen around the two nuclei. These are most
prominent at 1.1 microns with NICMOS, and in K'-band with Keck adaptive optics.
We suggest that these point-sources represent young star clusters formed in the

Adding a single electron to such a droplet at half filling completes the QH

there is not a simple notion of ""word"" in Chinese language making really hard
to implement rule-based systems to segment written texts, thus lexicons and

other side, any piece of Chinese text usually includes segments present neither

pentaquark, is not well justified in the fitting procedure used by Dzierba et
al., as shown by comparison with the (K+K-) invariant mass spectrum, which is
one decay channel of the a_2 and f_2 tensor mesons. While kinematic reflections
are still a concern in some papers that have presented evidence for the
pentaquark, better quantitative calculations are needed to demonstrate the
significance of this effect.

the existence of such an anomalous Helium-like (and neutral Pion-like) stable

  Final version, to appear in ""Communications in Algebra""",,,,"math.QA",,"  Let U_q(sl_2) be the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo quantized universal enveloping
algebra over sl_2, let F_q[SL_2] be the corresponding quantum function algebra,
and let R be the ring of Laurent polynomials in q with coefficients in the ring
of integers. Let \Cal{U}_q(sl_2) be the unrestricted R-integer form of
U_q(sl_2) introduced by De Concini, Kac and Procesi. Within the quantum
function algebra F_q[SL_2], we study the subset \Cal{F}_q[SL_2] of all elements
which give values in the ring R when paired with \Cal{U}_q(sl_2).
  In this paper we describe \Cal{F}_q[SL_2]. In particular we provide a
presentation of it by generators and relations, and a nice R-spanning set (of
PBW type). Moreover, we give a direct proof that \Cal{F}_q[SL_2] is a Hopf
subalgebra of F_q[SL_2], and that the specialization of \Cal{F}_q[SL_2] at q=1
is the hyperalgebra U_Z(sl_2^*) associated to the Lie bialgebra sl_2^* dual to
sl_2: in other words, \Cal{F}_q[SL_2] is a ""quantum hyperalgebra"". In fact, our
description of \Cal{F}_q[SL_2] is much like the presentation of Lusztig's
restricted R-integer form of U_q(sl_2). We describe explicitly also the
specializations of \Cal{F}_q[SL_2] at roots of 1, and the associated quantum
Frobenius (epi)morphism; these results again closely resemble Lusztig's ones.
All this improve results proved in previous work by the first named author
basing upon the results of De Concini, Kac and Procesi.
  The same analysis is done for the analogue algebra \Cal{F}_q[GL_2], with
similar results, and also (as a key, intermediate step) for \Cal{F}_q[Mat_2],
for which even stronger results hold, in particular a PBW-like theorem.

conducting surfaces non-local charge transfers are performed between surface
elements which differ the most from the targeted equipotentiality of the
surface. The method is tested against analytical solutions and its wide range
of application is demonstrated. The method has appealing technical
characteristics. For the problem with N surface elements, the computational
complexity of the method essentially scales with N^alpha, where alpha < 2, the
required computer memory scales with N, while the error of the potential
decreases exponentially with the number of iterations for many orders of
magnitude of the error, without the presence of the Critical Slowing Down. The
Robin Hood method has a large potential of application in other classical as

time to HIV-1 infected patients, most patients achieve viral loads that are
``undetectable'' by standard assay (i.e., HIV-1 RNA $ < 50$ copies/ml). Yet
despite exhibiting sustained viral loads below the level of detection, a number
of these patients experience unexplained episodes of transient viremia or viral
""blips"". We propose here that transient activation of the immune system by
opportunistic infection may explain these episodes of viremia. Indeed, immune
activation by opportunistic infection may spur HIV replication, replenish viral
reservoirs and contribute to accelerated disease progression. In order to
investigate the effects of concurrent infection on chronically infected HIV
patients under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we
extend a simple dynamic model of the effects of vaccination on HIV infection
[Jones and Perelson, JAIDS 31:369-377, 2002] to include growing pathogens. We
then propose a more realistic model for immune cell expansion in the presence
of pathogen, and include this in a set of competing models that allow low
baseline viral loads in the presence of drug treatment. Programmed expansion of
immune cells upon exposure to antigen is a feature not previously included in
HIV models, and one that is especially important to consider when simulating an
immune response to opportunistic infection. Using these models we show that
viral blips with realistic duration and amplitude can be generated by
concurrent infections in HAART treated patients.

But, perfect copying is possible, if it is known that unknown states to be
copied is contained by the set of orthogonal states, which is called the copied
set. However, if our operation is limited to local operations and classical
communications, this problem is not trivial. Recently, F. Anselmi, A. Chefles
and M.B. Plenio constructed theory of local copying when the copied set
consists of maximally entangled states. They also classified the copied set
when it consists of two orthogonal states (New. J. Phys. 6, 164 (2004)). In
this paper, we completely classify the copied set of local copying of the
maximally entangled states in the prime dimensional system. That is, we prove
that, in the prime dimensional system, the set of locally copiable maximally
entangled states is equivalent to the set of Simultaneously Schmidt
decomposable canonical form Bell states. As a result, we conclude that local
copying of maximally entangled states is much more difficult than local
discrimination at least in prime dimensional systems.

  We illustrate that the behaviour of our walk with entangled coins can be very

demonstrate that simply by changing the shift operator, we can generate widely
different distributions. We also compare the behaviour of quantum walks with

by using the Cartan decomposition of a unitary matrix. We extend this approach
by noting that the unitary group is compact. This allows us to reduce the
execution time of a quantum algorithm $U_{\rm alg}$ further by adding an extra
gate $W$ to it. This gate $W$ sends $U_{\rm alg}$ to another algorithm $WU_{\rm
alg}$ which is executable in a shorter time than $U_{\rm alg}$. We call this
technique warp-drive. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that
the execution time of Grover's algorithm is reduced in two-qubit NMR quantum
computer. Warp-drive is potentially a powerful tool in accelerating algorithms
and reducing the errors in any realization. of a quantum computer
