population properties and galaxy evolution of an observationally homogeneous

present high S/N long-slit spectroscopy of 86 nearby elliptical and S0
galaxies. 8 of them are isolated, selected according to a rigorous criterion.
This survey has the advantage of covering a larger wavelength range than
normally found in the literature, including [OIII]5007 and Halpha, both
important for emission correction. Among the 86 galaxies with S/N>15 (per
resolution element, for r_e/8 central aperture), 57 have their Hbeta-index
corrected for emission, average correction is 0.190A in Hbeta; 42 galaxies
reveal [OIII]5007 emission, of which 16 also show obvious Halpha emission. Most
of the galaxies in the sample do not show obvious signs of disturbances nor
tidal features in the morphologies, although 11 belong to the Arp catalogue of
peculiar galaxies; only 3 of them (NGC750, NGC751, NGC3226) seem to be strongly
interacting. We present the measurement of 25 central line-strength indices
calibrated to the Lick/IDS system. Kinematic information is obtained for the
sample. We analyse the line-strength index vs velocity dispersion relations for
our sample of mainly low density environment galaxies, and compare the slope of
the relations with cluster galaxies from the literature. Our main findings are
that the index-sigma_0 relations presented for low-density regions are not
significantly different from those of cluster E/S0s. The slope of the
index-sigma_0 relations does not seem to change for early-type galaxies of
different environmental densities, but the scatter of the relations seems
larger for group, field and isolated galaxies than for cluster galaxies.

significant Balmer break, suggesting that the galaxy is in the poststarburst

This suggests the possibility that a mature stellar population is already in

the 8-m Subaru telescope at Mauna Kea, the 1.5-m Tillinghast telescope at the
F. L. Whipple Observatory, and the 4-m Mayall telescope at the Kitt Peak
National Observatory. The spectra cover the Lick index red spectral region as
well as higher order Balmer lines in the blue. Spectra have been taken with the
slit off-set from the nucleus to avoid scattered light contamination from the
bright nucleus of M32. An analysis of numerous absorption features,
particularly involving the H$\gamma$ and H$\beta$ Balmer lines, reveals that
systematic radial trends are evident in the integrated spectrum of M32.
Population synthesis models indicate a radial change in both the age and
chemical composition of the light-weighted mean stellar population in M32, from
the nucleus out to 33"", i.e., approximately 1.0 effective radius, R_e.
Specifically, the light-weighted mean stellar population at 1 R_e is older, by
\~3 Gyr, and more metal-poor, by ~-0.25 dex in [Fe/H], t han the central value
of ~4 Gyr and [Fe/H]~0.0. We show that this apparent population trend cannot be
attributed to a varying contribution from either hot stars or emission line
contamination. The increase in age and decrease in metal-abundance with radius
are sufficiently well-matched to explain the flat radial color profiles
previously observed in M32. In addition, the ratio of Mg to Fe abundance,
[Mg/Fe], increases from ~-0.25 in the nucleus to ~-0.08 at 1 R_e. Finally, we
find spuriously pronounced line strength gradients in the Mayall data that are
an artifact of scattered light from the bright nucleus. Scattered light issues
may explain the lack of consistency among previously published studies of
radial line strength gradients in M32.

bipolar jet from RW Aur. We find signatures of rotation within the first 300 AU
of the jet (1.''5 from RW Aur). Both lobes rotate in the same direction (i.e.
with different helicities). Toroidal velocities are in the range 5 - 30 km/s at
20 (30) AU from the symmetry axis in the blueshifted (redshifted) lobe, in line
with other STIS observations and with theoretical simulations. The sense of
rotation is anti-clockwise looking from the tip of the blue lobe down to the
star. Rotation is more evident in the [OI] and [NII] lines and at the largest
sampled distance from the axis. We derive that the mass ejected in the observed
part of the outflow is accelerated from a region in the disk within about 0.5
(1.6) AU from the star for the blue (red) lobe. We estimate that the angular
momentum transport rate of the jet can be two thirds or more of the estimated

predicted by the models, and suggest that some heating must be provided at the

poloidal components of the magnetic field at the observed location. B_phi / B_p
= 3.8 +- 1.1 at 30 AU from the axis in the red lobe and -8.9 +- 2.7 at 20 AU

division. Most red galaxies, ~ 75%, are centrally concentrated, with a red
bulge or spheroid, while blue galaxies usually have exponential profiles.
However, there are two subclasses of red galaxies that are not bulge-dominated:
edge-on disks and a second category which we term diffuse red galaxies
(DIFRGs). The distant edge-on disks are similar in appearance and frequency to
those at low redshift, but analogs of DIFRGs are rare among local red galaxies.
DIFRGs have significant emission lines, indicating that they are reddened
mainly by dust rather than age. The DIFRGs in our sample are all at z>0.64,
suggesting that DIFRGs are more prevalent at high redshifts; they may be
related to the dusty or irregular extremely red objects (EROs) beyond z>1.2

approximately a solar mass with evidence of circumstellar disks. The accretion
rate is significantly lower for protostars of smaller mass, approximately
proportional to the second power of the stellar mass, \dot{M}_accr\propto M^2.
The traditional view is that the observed accretion is the consequence of the
angular momentum transport in isolated protostellar disks, controlled by disk
turbulence or self--gravity. However, these processes are not well understood
and the observed protostellar accretion, a fundamental aspect of star
formation, remains an unsolved problem. In this letter we propose the
protostellar accretion rate is controlled by accretion from the large scale gas
distribution in the parent cloud, not by the isolated disk evolution.
Describing this process as Bondi--Hoyle accretion, we obtain accretion rates
comparable to the observed ones. We also reproduce the observed dependence of
the accretion rate on the protostellar mass. These results are based on
realistic values of the ambient gas density and velocity, as inferred from

morphology of galaxies in the local universe based on a volume-limited sample
(0.030<z<0.065 and M_r<M_r^*+2) constructed from the data of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. First, we focus on how galaxy properties change with local density.
The star formation and morphology show a 'break' at the critical local density
of log Sigma_crit~0.4 galaxies h_75^2 Mpc^-2, which is in agreement with
previous studies. However, the break can be seen only for faint galaxies
(M^*_r+1 < M_r < M^*_r+2), and bright galaxies (M_r < M^*_r+1) show no break.
Thus, galaxies of different luminosities are found to show different
environmental dependencies. Next, we examine dependencies on richness of galaxy
systems. Star formation activities of galaxies are different from those of
field galaxies even in systems as poor as sigma~100 km/s. This result suggests
that environmental mechanisms that are effective only in rich systems, such as
ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and harassment, have not played a major role
in transforming galaxies into red early-type galaxies. Strangulation and
interactions between galaxies, however, remain candidates of the driver of the
environmental dependence. In the dense environments in the local universe, the
slow transformation of faint galaxies occurs to some extent, but the
transformation of bright galaxies is not clearly visible. We suggest that the
evolution of bright galaxies is not strongly related to galaxy system, such as
groups and clusters, while the evolution of faint galaxies is likely to be
closely connected to galaxy system.

detected, as well as diffuse emission. The bright sources have associated
compact radio emission and probably are young high-mass stars.
  The measured sizes and estimated temperatures indicate that these sources
together can supply the observed far-infrared luminosity. However, an optically
thick radio source with a possible mid-infrared counterpart may also contribute
significant luminosity; if so, it must be extremely deeply embedded.
  The infrared colour temperatures of 350-390 K and low radio brightness
suggest gravitational confinement of the H II regions and ongoing accretion at
a rate of a few 10^-8 M0/yr or more. Variations in the accretion rate would
explain the observed radio variability. The low estimated foreground extinction
suggests the existence of a cavity around the central stars, perhaps blown by
stellar winds.
  At least three radio sources without mid-infrared counterparts appear to show
proper motions of ~100 km/s, and may be deeply embedded young runaway OB stars,

properties of surfaces growing under deposition of material. Yet it is clear
that a theory describing the evolution of a surface should at the same time
describe the properties of the bulk buried underneath. Clearly, the structure
of the bulk is relevant for many practical purposes, such as the transport of
electric current in devices, transport of fluids in geological formations and
stress transmission in granular systems. The present paper demonstrates
explicitly how models describing deposition can provide us with information on
the structure of the bulk. Comparison of an analytic model with a simulation of
a discrete growth model reveals an interesting long range tail in the
density-density correlation in the direction of deposition.

particle (exclusion) models contain mechanisms of aggregated particle
diffusion, with rates epsilon<<1, particle deposition into cluster gaps, but
suppressed for the smallest gaps, and breakup of clusters which are adjacent to
large gaps. Cluster breakup rates vary with the cluster length x as kx^alpha.
The domain growth law x ~ (epsilon t)^z, with z=1/(2+alpha) for alpha>0, is
explained by a scaling picture, as well as the scaling of the density of double
vacancies (at which deposition and cluster breakup are allowed) as 1/[t(epsilon
t)^z]. Numerical simulations for several values of alpha and epsilon confirm
these results. An approximate factorization of the cluster configuration
probability is performed within the master equation resulting from the mapping
to a column picture. The equation for a one-variable scaling function explains
the above results. The probability distributions of cluster lengths scale as
P(x)= 1/(epsilon t)^z g(y), with y=x/(epsilon t)^z. However, those
distributions show a universal tail with the form g(y) ~ exp(-y^{3/2}), which
disagrees with the prediction of the independent cluster approximation. This
result is explained by the connection of the vacancy dynamics with the problem
of particle trapping in an infinite sea of traps and is confirmed by
simulation.

Phys. Lett. \bf{82}, 3952 (2003)], who showed that the conductance of one of
the quantum wires exhibits a resonant peak at low temperatures, whenever the
other wire is swept into the regime where local-moment formation is expected.

the inter-wire interaction that calculated the transmission properties of one

extra scattering term, arising from the presence of the local moment in the
swept wire. To determine the transmission coefficients in this system, we
derive equations describing the dynamics of electrons in the swept and fixed

observation of a resonant peak in the conductance of the fixed wire is
correlated to the appearance of additional structure (near $0.75\cdot$ or

power-law potential V(x)=\sum_i U_i|x_i|^{p_i} is calculated with the help of
variational perturbation theory. It is shown that the interaction-induced shift
in T_c fulfills the relation (T_c-T_c^0)/T_c^0= D_1(eta)a + D'(eta)a^{2 eta}+
O(a^2) with T_c^0 the critical temperature of the trapped ideal gas, a the
s-wave scattering length divided by the thermal wavelength at T_c, and
eta=1/2+\sum_i 1/p_i the potential-shape parameter. The terms D_1(eta)a and
D'(eta) a^{2 eta} describe the leading-order perturbative and nonperturbative
contributions to the critical temperature, respectively. This result
quantitatively shows how an increasingly inhomogeneous potential suppresses the
influence of critical fluctuations. The appearance of the a^{2 eta}
contribution is qualitatively explained in terms of the Ginzburg criterion.

rules governing the dynamics of network growth, because they are static spatial
networks. Instead, the heterogeneity in the networks stems from differences in

events. In analyses for burst gravitational waves, the detection and
fake-reduction schemes are different from well-investigated ones for a
chirp-wave analysis, because precise waveform templates are not available. We
used an excess-power filter for the extraction of gravitational-wave
candidates, and developed two methods for the reduction of fake events caused
by non-stationary noises of the detector. These analysis schemes were applied
to real data from the TAMA300 interferometric gravitational wave detector. As a
result, fake events were reduced by a factor of about 1000 in the best cases.
The resultant event candidates were interpreted from an astronomical viewpoint.
We set an upper limit of 2.2x10^3 events/sec on the burst gravitational-wave
event rate in our Galaxy with a confidence level of 90%. This work sets a
milestone and prospects on the search for burst gravitational waves, by
establishing an analysis scheme for the observation data from an
interferometric gravitational wave detector.

waves propagating on a Kaluza-Klein background and we face separately the two
cases in which respectively the waves are generated before and after the
process of dimensional compactification. We show that if the waves are
originated on a 5-d space-time which fulfills the principle of general
relativity, then the process of compactification can not reduce the dynamics to
the pure 4-dimensional scalar, vector and tensor degrees of freedom. In
particular, while the electromagnetic waves evolve independently, the scalar
and tensor fields couple to each other; this feature appears because, when the
gauge conditions are splitted, the presence of the scalar ripple prevents that
the 4-d gravitational waves are traceless. The phenomenological issue of this
scheme consists of an anomalous relative amplitude of the two independent
polarizations which characterize the 4-d gravitational waves. Such profile of
polarization amplitudes, if detected, would outline the extra-dimension in a
very reliable way, because a wave with non-zero trace can not arise from
ordinary matter sources. We discuss the above mentioned phenomenon either in
the case of a unit constant value of the background scalar component (when the
geodesic deviation is treated with precise outputs), and assuming such
background field as a dynamical degree (only qualitative conclusion are
provided here, because the details of the polarization amplitudes depend on the
choice of specific metric forms). Finally we perturb a real Kaluza-Klein theory
showing that in this context, while the electromagnetic waves propagate
independently, the 4-d gravitational waves preserve their ordinary structure,
while the scalar plays for them the role of source.

production in hadronic cascades. As a practical case study, the muon-induced
neutron background expected in a 250 kg liquid-xenon WIMP dark matter detector

detailed model of neutron elastic scattering in GEANT4 was also shown to
influence the nuclear recoil spectrum observed in the target, which is

of the convergence of rescaled distributions to the limiting normal
distribution required by the central limit theorem; this is stronger than the
usual requirement that the mean square displacement grow asymptotically
linearly in time. The main model studied is a chaotic Lorentz gas where the
central limit theorem has been rigorously proved. We study one-dimensional
position and displacement densities describing the time evolution of
statistical ensembles in a channel geometry, using a more refined method than
histograms. We find a pronounced oscillatory fine structure, and show that this
has its origin in the geometry of the billiard domain. This fine structure
prevents the rescaled densities from converging pointwise to gaussian
densities; however, demodulating them by the fine structure gives new densities
which seem to converge uniformly. We give an analytical estimate of the rate of
convergence of the original distributions to the limiting normal distribution,
based on the analysis of the fine structure, which agrees well with simulation
results. We show that using a Maxwellian (gaussian) distribution of velocities
in place of unit speed velocities does not affect the growth of the mean square
displacement, but changes the limiting shape of the distributions to a
non-gaussian one. Using the same methods, we give numerical evidence that a
non-chaotic polygonal channel model also obeys the central limit theorem, but
with a slower convergence rate.

dominate in the Universe. An even higher density of such matter seems to be
gravitationally trapped in our Galaxy. The nature of dark matter can be
unveiled only, if it is detected in the laboratory. Thus the accomplishment of
this task is central to physics and cosmology. Current fashionable
supersymmetric models provide a natural dark matter candidate, which is the
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Since the LSP is much heavier than the
proton, while its average energy is in the keV region, the most likely
possibility for its direct detection is via its elastic scattering with a
nuclear target. In order to evaluate the event rate one needs the nuclear
structure (form factor and/or spin response function) for the special nuclear
targets of experimental interest. Since the expected rates for
neutralino-nucleus scattering are expected to be small, one should exploit all
the characteristic signatures of this reaction. Such are: (i) In the standard
recoil measurements the modulation of the event rate due to the Earth's motion.
(ii) In directional recoil experiments the correlation of the event rate with
the sun's motion. One now has both modulation, which is much larger and depends
not only on time, but on the direction of observation as well, and a large
forward-backward asymmetry. (iii) In non recoil experiments gamma rays
following the decay of excited states populated during the Nucleus-LSP
collision. Branching ratios of about 6 percent are possible. (iv) novel
experiments in which one observes the electrons prodused during the collisionof

electron-positron pairs is a consequence of quantum electrodynamics. A way for
detecting this phenomenon has been devised based on interacting modes generated
in microwave waveguides or cavities [G. Brodin, M. Marklund and L. Stenflo,

suggest a concrete cavity geometry, make quantitative estimates and propose
experimental details. It is found that detection of photon-photon scattering
can be within the reach of present day technology.

processes. Of key importance is the intermittence of the ""magnetic turbulence""
as seen in ground based and solar wind magnetic data. The methods used in this
paper (estimation of flatness and multifractal spectra) are commonly used in
the studies of fluid or MHD turbulence. The results show that single
observatory characteristics of magnetic fluctuations are different from those
of the multi-observatory AE-index. In both data sets, however, the influence of
the solar wind fluctuations is recognizable. The correlation between the
scaling/singularity features of solar wind magnetic fluctuations and the
corresponding geomagnetic response is demonstrated in a number of cases. The
results are also discussed in terms of patchy reconnection processes in
magnetopause and forced or/and self-organized criticality (F/SOC) of internal

determined by an acoustic wave equation. In the slowly varying acoustic limit,
we analyse the resulting system of kinetic equations, and show that they

in conjunction with the damping may result in stationary strong field

starting from the geometrical representation of bonds of tetrahedral molecules,
as complex numbers in polar form, and the empirical Fischer projections used in
organic chemistry. A general orthogonal O(4) algebra is derived from which we
obtain a chirality index related to the classification of a molecule as
achiral, diastereoisomer or enantiomer. Consequently, the chiral features of
tetrahedral chains can be predicted by means of a molecular Aufbau. Moreover, a
consistent Schroedinger equation is developed, whose solutions are the bonds of
tetrahedral molecules in complex number representation. Starting from this
result, the O(4) algebra can be considered as a quantum chiral algebra. It is
shown that the operators of such an algebra preserve the parity of the whole

pure state which is not a Pauli eigenstate), together with stabilizer
operations, gives quantum universality. It remains open whether there is also a
tight separation in the so-called T direction.

implement a one or two qubit encoded gate in an effective fault-tolerant way,
it is possible to choose an adequate non-encoded noisy gate if the memory error
