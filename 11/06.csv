for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. Dust and ionized gas are detected in
all galaxies. The optical nebulae are primarily concentrated on the nuclei and
extend out to radii of a few hundred parsecs, in compact clumps, filaments, or
disks. Two galaxies, NGC 6166 and NGC 6338, also possess diffuse, ionized
filaments on kiloparsec scales. The ionized gas is entirely contained within
the nuclear disks of ESO 208-G021, NGC 3078, and NGC 7720. In the radio-loud
galaxy NGC 6166, emission-line filaments are detected along the radio lobes,
possibly as a result of shock ionization. A wide range of ionized gas masses,
$M_g\approx7\times10^2-3\times10^6$ $M_\odot$, are calculated from the observed
fluxes. Even in this small sample, the orientation of the ionized material
correlates well with the major or minor axis of the galaxies, consistent with
an external origin for the dust and gas.

with the E140M echelle mode of STIS, we find 44 intervening O VI absorbers and
14 associated O VI systems [i.e, z(abs) ~ z(QSO)]. The implied number of
intervening O VI absorbers per unit redshift is dN/dz(O VI) = 23+/-4 for rest

the baryons if their typical metallicity is 1/10 solar and the O VI ion

population of remarkably broad Lya lines have been recognized in low-z quasar

the study of the non-Gaussianity of interferometric observations of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). The interferometric measurements (visibilities) are
transformed into signal-to-noise eigenmodes, and then the method is applied
directly in Fourier space. This transformation allows us to perform the
analysis in different subsets of eigenmodes according to their signal-to-noise
level. The method can also deal with non-uniform or incomplete coverage of the
UV plane. We explore here two possibilities: we analyse either the real and
imaginary parts of the complex visibilities (Gaussianly distributed under the
Gaussianity hypothesis) or their phases (uniformly distributed under the
Gaussianity hypothesis). The power of the method in discriminating between
Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions is studied by using several kinds of
non-Gaussian simulations. On the one hand, we introduce a certain degree of
non-Gaussianity directly into the Fourier space using the Edgeworth expansion,
and afterwards the desired correlation is introduced. On the other hand, we
consider interferometric observations of a map with topological defects (cosmic
strings). To these previous non-Gaussian simulations we add different noise
levels and quantify the required signal-to-noise ratio necessary to achieve a
detection of these non-Gaussian features. Finally, we have also studied the
ability of the method to constrain the so-called nonlinear coupling constant
f_{NL} using chi^2 simulations.The whole method is illustrated here by
application to simulated data from the Very Small Array interferometer.

highest redshift (z_QSO=6.43), hosts a supermassive black hole formed within
0.9 Gyr after the Big Bang. This requirement places constraints on the
cosmological formation of SMBHs, believed to grow from smaller initial seeds by
a combination of accretion and mergers. We focus on gas accretion onto seeds
produced by the collapse of Pop III stars at high redshift. We incorporate the
results of recent relativistic, MHD simulations of disk accretion onto Kerr
black holes to track the coupled evolution of the masses and spins of the
holes. We allow for an additional amplification of ~10^4 in the mass of a
typical seed due to mergers, consistent with recent Monte Carlo simulations of
hierarchical mergers of cold, dark matter halos containing black hole seeds. We
find that the growth of Pop III black hole seeds to ~10^9 M_sun by z_QSO = 6.43
favors MHD accretion disks over standard thin disks. MHD disks tend to drive
the holes to a submaximal equilibrium spin rate a/M ~ 0.95 and radiation
efficiency epsilon_M ~ 0.2, while standard thin disks drive them to maximal
spin (a/M = 1) and efficiency (epsilon_M = 0.42). This small difference in
efficiency results in a huge difference in mass amplification by accretion at
the Eddington limit. The MHD equilibrium efficiency is consistent with the
observed ratio of the QSO plus AGN luminosity density to the local SMBH mass
density. Our prototype analysis is designed to stimulate the incorporation of
results from relativistic stellar collapse and MHD accretion simulations in
future Monte Carlo simulations of hierarchical structure formation to better
determine the cosmological role of SMBHs and their mass and spin distributions.

spot and the plasma rotation velocity. In the limit of small angle
approximation, aberration phase shift becomes independent of the inclination
angle alpha and the sight line impact angle beta. However, at larger altitudes
or larger rotation phases, the shift does depend on alpha and beta. We have
given an expression for the phase shift in the intensity profile by taking into
account of aberration, retardation and polar cap currents. We have re-estimated
the emission heights of the six classical pulsars, and analyzed the profile of
a millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715 at 1440 MHz by fitting the Gaussians to
pulse components. By this procedure we have been able to identify 11 emission

validity of the low-energy effective theory. In the matter dominated case there
is a finite time (which can be large enough to exceed the present age of the
Universe) during which the model remains in the stable region. In inflationary
regime the system does not experience an overshoot only if the Hubble parameter
is larger than the characteristic energy scale of the effective field theory

theory in which mass, wave function, and charge renormalization could be
carried out exactly. In early studies of this model it was found that there is
a critical value of g^2, the square of the renormalized coupling constant,
above which g_0^2, the square of the unrenormalized coupling constant, is
negative. Thus, for g^2 larger than this critical value, the Hamiltonian of the
Lee model becomes non-Hermitian. It was also discovered that in this
non-Hermitian regime a new state appears whose norm is negative. This state is
called a ghost state. It has always been assumed that in this ghost regime the
Lee model is an unacceptable quantum theory because unitarity appears to be
violated. However, in this regime while the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, it
does possess PT symmetry. It has recently been discovered that a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian having PT symmetry may define a quantum theory that is unitary. The
proof of unitarity requires the construction of a new time-independent operator
called C. In terms of C one can define a new inner product with respect to
which the norms of the states in the Hilbert space are positive. Furthermore,
it has been shown that time evolution in such a theory is unitary. In this
paper the C operator for the Lee model in the ghost regime is constructed
exactly in the V/N-theta sector. It is then shown that the ghost state has a
positive norm and that the Lee model is an acceptable unitary quantum field
theory for all values of g^2.

M-theory based upon a circular ring, but with arbitrary, fluctuating charge
distributions around the ring. The solutions have three arbitrary charge
distribution functions, but their asymptotic charges and angular momenta only
depend upon the total charges on the ring. The arbitrary density fluctuations
thus represent ""hair."" By varying the charge distributions one can continuously
change the entropy of these black rings; to our knowledge this is the first
solution in which the entropy depends on classical moduli. We also show that
there is a family of solutions, with two arbitrary functions, for which the
horizon remains rotationally invariant, and yet the complete solution breaks
rotational symmetry. If the horizon area is set to zero then one obtains
families of supertube solutions. We find that our general solutions are
governed by three harmonic functions that may be thought of as classical
excitations of a string. The horizon area provides a natural Lorentz metric on
these excitations, and the constancy of the rotational invariance of the
horizon imposes a set of Virasoro constraints.

6-dimensional topological A and B models, the self-dual sector of loop quantum

that the 7-dimensional M-theory perspective sheds some light on the fact that
the topological string partition function is a wavefunction, as well as on
S-duality between the A and B models. The degrees of freedom of the A and B
models appear as conjugate variables in the 7-dimensional theory. Finally, from
the topological M-theory perspective we find hints of an intriguing holographic
link between non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills in 4 dimensions and A model
topological strings on twistor space.

where we call \T the holomorphic tension. This is directly related to the
central charge of the supersymmetry algebra. Using the tools of the
Cachazo-Douglas-Seiberg-Witten solution we compute the holomorphic tension as a
holomorphic function of the couplings, the mass and the dynamical scale: \T =
\sqrt{W'^2+f}. A first approximation is given using the generalized Konishi
anomaly in the semiclassical limit. The full quantum corrections are computed
in the strong coupling regime using the factorization equations that relate the
N=2 curve to the N=1 curve. Finally we study the limit in which the non-BPS

This suggests hadron production via quark coalescence from a thermalized parton
system. Measuring the elliptic flow of charmed hadrons, which are believed to
originate rather from fragmentation than from coalescence processes, might
therefore change our view of hadron production in heavy ion collisions.
  While direct v_2 measurements of charmed hadrons are currently not available,
single electron v_2 at sufficiently high transverse momenta can serve as a
substitute. At transverse momenta above 2 GeV/c, the production of single
electrons from non-photonic sources is expected to be dominated by the decay of
charmed hadrons. Simulations show a strong correlation between the flow of the
charmed hadrons and the flow of their decay electrons for p_T > 2 GeV/c.
  We will present preliminary STAR results from our single electron v_2
measurements from Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies.

the invariant masses M_{pX} and M_{\pi^{+}X} of the pp->ppX and pp->p\pi^{+}X
reactions respectively. Many tests were made to see if these structures could
have been produced by experimental artefacts. Their small widths and the
stability of the extracted masses lead us to conclude that these structures are
genuine and may correspond to new exotic baryons. Several attempts to identify
them, including the possible ""missing baryons"" approach, are discussed.

a component from the low density surface region of nuclei and a component which
scales more like the nuclear volume. The energy dependence of the surface
component is similar to the deuteron cross section, it shows a clear signal for
the second resonance peak assigned to the excitation of the P11(1440),
D13(1520), and S11(1535). The volume component behaves differently, it is
lacking the second resonance peak and shows an enhancement at intermediate
photon energies.

ATP synthase is investigated. In this model there are two kinds of
characteristic time. One is dynamical, the relaxation time of the system.
Others are chemical, the chemical reaction rates at which a proton binds to or
dissociates from the motor protein. The inequalities between them affect the
behavior of the physical quantities, such as the rotation velocity and the
proton pumping rates across the membrane. The energy transduction efficiency is
calculated and the condition under which the efficiency can become higher is
discussed. The proton pumping rate and the efficiency have a peak where a
certain set of inequalities between the chemical reaction rates and the
reciprocal of the relaxation time holds. The efficiency also has a peak for a
certain value of the load. The best efficiency condition for the pump process
is consistent with that for the motor process.

exploited for improvement of predictions of geomagnetic activity. To this end
layered backpropagation artificial neural network model with feedback
connection was used for the study of the solar wind - magnetosphere coupling
and prediction of geomagnetic $D_{st}$ index. The solar wind input was taken
from principal component analysis of interplanetary magnetic field, proton
density and bulk velocity. Superior network performance was achieved in cases

to a signal generate a multitude of protein phosphorylation states and
heterogeneous protein complexes. Here, using a computational model that
accounts for 307 molecular species implied by specified interactions of four
proteins involved in signalling by the immunoreceptor Fc$\epsilon$RI, we
determine the relative importance of molecular species that can be generated
during signalling, chemical transitions among these species, and reaction paths
that lead to activation of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) Syk. By all of
these measures and over 2- and 10-fold ranges of model parameters--rate
constants and initial concentrations--only a small portion of the biochemical
network is active. The spectrum of active complexes, however, can be shifted
dramatically, even by a change in the concentration of a single protein, which
suggests that the network can produce qualitatively different responses under
different cellular conditions and in response to different inputs. Reduced
models that reproduce predictions of the full model for a particular set of
parameters lose their predictive capacity when parameters are varied over
2-fold ranges.

particular, the explicit form of decomposition of a positive map and the
uniqueness of this decomposition for extremal positive maps for 2 dimensional
case are described. The difference of the structure of positive maps between 2
