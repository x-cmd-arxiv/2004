that spontaneously breaks Lorentz invariance. The equation of state of this gas
varies from 1/3 to less than -1 and can lead to the observed cosmic
acceleration. The particles are always stable. In our particular class of
models these particles are fermions with a chiral coupling to the condensate.
They may behave as relativistic matter at early times, produce a brief period
where they dominate the expansion with w<0 today, and behave as matter at late
time. There are no small parameters in our models, which generically lead to
dark energy clustering and, depending on the choice of parameters, smoothing of
small scale power.

observations of 23 AGN, and use the resulting information to try to provide
answers to some of the main open questions about warm absorbers: where do they
originate, what effect do they have on their host galaxies, and what is their
importance within the energetics and dynamics of the AGN system as a whole? We
find that the warm absorbers of nearby Seyferts and certain QSOs are most
likely to originate in outflows from the dusty torus, and that the kinetic
luminosity of these outflows accounts for well under 1% of the bolometric
luminosities of the AGN. Our analysis supports, however, the view that the
relativistic outflows recently observed in two PG quasars have their origin in
accretion disc winds, although the energetic importance of these outflows is
similar to that of the Seyfert warm absorbers. We find that the observed soft
X-ray absorbing ionisation phases fill less than 10% of the available volume.
Finally, we show that the amount of matter processed through an AGN outflow
system, over the lifetime of the AGN, is probably large enough to have a
significant influence on the evolution of the host galaxy and of the AGN
itself.

origin of E1 is most probably due to the interaction of the radio-jet of 3C 120

that may be a tidal tail, consequence of the past merging event. We found a
bright EELR (E2) in the innermost part of this tidal tail, nearby the nucleus,

to the complex of ultraviolet (UV) filaments in the starburst-driven outflows

provided by shock-heated or photoionized gas except perhaps in the brightest
filaments in M82, suggesting that most of the UV light is the stellar continuum
of the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust in the outflow. This
interpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging polarimetry in
M82. The morphology of the UV filaments in both galaxies shows a high degree of
spatial correlation with H-alpha and X-ray emission. This indicates that these
outflows contain cold gas and dust, some of which may be vented into the
intergalactic medium (IGM). UV light is seen in the ``H-alpha cap'' 11 kpc
North of M82. If this cap is a result of the wind fluid running into a
pre-existing gas cloud, the gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial in
nature but was probably stripped from M82 or M81. If starburst winds
efficiently expel dust into the IGM, this could have significant consequences
for the observation of cosmologically distant objects.

The FUV diffuse fraction appears to be remarkably constant near 0.65 over a
large range in galactocentric radius, with departures to higher values in
circumnuclear regions and, most notably, at the limit of the H-alpha disk. We
suggest that the increase in FUV diffuse fraction at large galactocentric radii
could indicate that a substantial portion of the diffuse emission beyond this
point is not generated in situ but rather scattered from dust, after
originating in the vicinity of the disk's outermost HII regions. Radial
variation of the H-alpha diffuse fraction was also measured. We found the
H-alpha diffuse fraction generally near 0.4 but rising toward the galaxy
center, up to 0.6. We made no attempt to correct our diffuse fraction
measurements for position-dependent extinction, so the quoted values are best
interpreted as upper limits given the plausibly higher extinction for stellar
clusters relative to their surroundings.

represents the first time that such photo-typing has been attempted, in a blind
fashion, on newly-discovered supernovae. For one of the target supernovae,
SN2004cs, our photometry provided the first constraint on the SN type, which we
predicted would be type Ia. To the contrary, however, our subsequent Keck
spectroscopy shows it to be an unusual type II supernova. For each of the other
two supernovae, SN2004dh (type II) and SN2004dk (type Ib), our photo-typing
results are consistent with the known type of the event as determined from
ground-based spectroscopy; however, the colors of SN2004dk are also consistent
with a type Ic or type II classification. We discuss our approach to the
challenges of photo-typing - contamination by host galaxy light and the unknown
photometric quality of the data - in the case where it is desirable to complete
the analysis with just one night of observations. The growing interest in the
properties and behavior of very young supernovae, and the increased discovery
rate for such events, mean that prompt photo-typing analyses can provide useful
input to observational campaigns. Our results demonstrate the value and
feasibility of such a project for P60, at the same time illustrating its chief
inherent shortcoming: an inability to identify new and unusual events as such
without later spectroscopic observations.

the radio luminosities of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries,

puzzling systematics. In particular, cooler HB stars often show rapid rotation
(with velocities in excess of 10 km/s), while hotter HB stars typically show
much smaller rotation velocities. Simple models of angular momentum evolution
of stars from the main sequence through the red giant branch fail to explain
these effects. In general, evolutionary models in all cases preserve a rapidly
rotating core. The observed angular velocities of HB stars require that some of
the angular momentum stored in the core reaches the surface.
  To test the idea that HB stars contain such a core, one can appeal to
detailed computations of trace element abundences and rotational mixing.
However, a more direct probe is available to test these limiting cases of
angular momentum evolution. Some of the hottest horizontal branch stars are
members of the pulsating sdB class. They frequently show rich pulsation spectra
characteristic of nonradially pulsating stars. Thus their pulsations probe the
internal rotation of these stars, and should show the effects of rapid rotation
in their cores. Using models of sdB stars that include angular momentum
evolution, we explore this possibility and show that some of the sdB pulsators
may indeed have rapidly rotating cores.

contributed by the disk. The contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. In
the UV, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-like
structure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic HII regions recently
discovered in H\alpha, and other UV emission regions discovered for the first

stellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. The UV emission associated with
NGC 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net SFR of 3.37+-0.25
M_sun/yr. Several large UV emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from the
nucleus of NGC7318b. Although both NGC7319 and NGC7318b show peculiar UV
morphology, their SFR is consistent with that of normal Sbc galaxies,

absolute pointing refinement to an accuracy depending on the robustness of

F606W GEMS data from ~60 resolved galaxies per square arcminute. We measure the
two-point shear correlation function, the top-hat shear variance and the shear
power spectrum, performing an E/B mode decomposition for each statistic. We
show that we are not limited by systematic errors and use our results to place
joint constraints on the matter density parameter Omega_m and the amplitude of
the matter power spectrum sigma_8. We find sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.65}=0.68 +/-

redshift of the survey and sampling variance.
  Removing image and point spread function (PSF) distortions are crucial to all
weak lensing analyses. We therefore include a thorough discussion on the degree
of ACS PSF distortion and anisotropy which we characterise directly from GEMS
data. Consecutively imaged over 20 days, GEMS data also allows us to
investigate PSF instability over time. We find that, even in the relatively
short GEMS observing period, the ACS PSF ellipticity varies at the level of a
few percent which we account for with a semi-time dependent PSF model. Our
correction for the temporal and spatial variability of the PSF is shown to be
successful through a series of diagnostic tests.

X-ray sources detected by Chandra in an intermediate flux range
($10^{-15}-10^{-12}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) that comprises most of the X-ray
background. 267 X-ray sources spread over 5 archived fields were detected. The
$\log N-\log S$ distribution obtained for this sample is consistent with the
results of other surveys. Deep $V$ and $I$ images were taken of these fields in
order to calculate X-ray-to-optical flux ratios. Identifications and redshifts
were obtained for 106 sources using optical spectroscopy from 8-m class
telescopes to reach the optically faintest sources, to the same level as deeper
X-ray fields like the Chandra Deep Fields, showing that the nature of sources
detected depends mostly on the optical limit for spectroscopy. In general,
sources optically classified as obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) have
redder optical colors than unobscured AGN. A rough correlation between
$f_X/f_{\rm opt}$ and hard X-ray luminosity was found for obscured AGN
confirming the prediction by existing models that in obscured AGN the optical
light is completely dominated by the host galaxy. The previously claimed
decrease of the obscured to unobscured AGN ratio with increasing X-ray
luminosity is observed. However, this correlation can be explained as a
selection effect caused by the lower optical flux of obscured AGN. Comparison
between the observed $N_H$ distribution and predictions by existing models
shows that the sample appears complete up to $N_H<3\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$,
while for more obscured sources incompleteness plays an important role in the
observed obscured to unobscured AGN ratio.

consider various physical parameters as functions of the SNR age, including the
previous results on SN 1006 \citep{bamba2003b}; the filament width on the
downstream side increases with the SNR age, and the spectrum becomes softer
keeping a nonthermal feature. It was also found that a function, that is the
roll-off frequency divided by the square of the scale width on the downstream
side, shows negative correlation with the age, which might provide us some
information on the DSA theory.

its high sensitivity to the presence of young stellar populations. Our NUV CMR
for UV-weak galaxies shows a well-defined slope and thus will be useful for
interpreting the restframe NUV data of distant galaxies and studying their star

well fitted by a power-law model with photon index of 1.83+/-0.08 attenuated by
a Compton-thin absorber (N_H \simeq 2.2 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}). A narrow iron line
is detected at 6.43_{-0.02}^{+0.01} keV with an equivalent width of ~150 eV;
the line velocity width is marginally resolved to be \sigma~60eV. The soft

hard X-ray band, whereas both the iron line and the soft emission show no
significant variability. It is suggested that the nucleus has experienced an
overall long-term trend of decreasing hard X-ray intensity on a timescale of
years. We discuss the origins of the spectral components.

parameters, namely the jet power Q_{0} and central density of the galaxy

determined, and compared with the relevant parameters in a comparison sample of
normal-size sources consisting of 3C, B2, and other sources. Having the
apparent radio luminosity P and linear size D of each sample source, Q_{0} and
rho_{0} are obtained by fitting the dynamical model of Kaiser et al. (1997). We
find that: (i) there is not a unique factor governing the source size; they are
old sources with temperate jet power (Q_{0}) evolved in a relatively
low-density environment (rho_{0}). The size is dependent, in order of
decreasing partial correlation coefficients, on age; then on Q_{0}; next on
rho_{0}. (ii) A self-similar expansion of the sources' cocoon seems to be
feasible if the power supplied by the jets is a few orders of magnitude above
the minimum-energy value. In other cases the expansion can only initially be
self-similar; a departure from self-similarity for large and old sources is
justified by observational data of giant sources. (iii) An apparent increase of
the lowest internal pressure value observed within the largest sources' cocoon
with redshift is obscured by the intrinsic dependence of their size on age and
the age on redshift, which hinders us from making definite conclusions about a
cosmological evolution of intergalactic medium (IGM) pressure.

with radius and which dominates over the more localized variations in opacity
between the arm and interarm regions. We also find a trend for the FIR/UV ratio
to take on higher values in the regions of diffuse interarm emission than in
the spiral-arm regions, at a given radius. This is interpreted quantitatively
in terms of the escape probability of UV photons from spiral arms and their
subsequent scattering in the interarm regions, and in terms of the larger

rigidity-dependent model that explains the origin of the knee and the second
knee of the CR spectrum, as well as the most recent observations of composition
and anisotropies. Moreover, the behavior of the diffusion tensor for charged
particles propagating in highly turbulent magnetic fields is determined
numerically. We also investigate the high energy neutrino fluxes induced by
CRs, and we show that a rigidity-dependent scenario for the CR knee reduces the
background of atmospheric neutrinos, hence encouraging the search for
astrophysical neutrino sources. After exploring this effect in the detection
channel of lepton tracks, we investigate the less studied ``shower'' channel,
which turns out to be particularly effective for isolating the prompt
atmospheric neutrino component. Finally, we consider in detail the nuclear
photodisintegration model as an alternative explanation for the knee in the CR
spectrum, in which CR nuclei emitted by a source are disintegrated during their
propagation through a surrounding optical/UV photon field. In this case, the
composition is predicted to turn lighter across the knee, in constrast to the
results obtained in rigidity-dependent scenarios.

is modeled by ballistic motion of those particles. The regime of molecular
diffusion is also analyzed via models of lattice random walks biased along the
pores. The aggregation at the surface or near previously aggregated particles
was modeled by different probabilistic rules, accounting for the possibilities
of more compact or more ramified deposits. In the model of Knudsen diffusion
and in some cases of molecular diffusion, there is an initial regime of uniform
deposition along the pore, after which the deposits acquire an approximately
wedge shape, with the pore plugging near its entrance. After the regime of
uniform deposition and before that of critical pore plugging, the average
aggregation position slowly decreases with the number N of deposited particles
approximately as N^{-0.25}. The apparently universal features of deposits

been open, except for the case where the noise is white. Here we find the
feedback capacity of the stationary first-order moving average additive

$Y_i = X_i + Z_i,$ $i = 1, 2, ...,$ where the input $\{X_i\}$ satisfies a power
constraint and the noise $\{Z_i\}$ is a first-order moving average Gaussian
process defined by $Z_i = \alpha U_{i-1} + U_i,$ $|\alpha| \le 1,$ with white
Gaussian innovations $U_i,$ $i = 0,1,....$
  We show that the feedback capacity of this channel is $-\log x_0,$ where
$x_0$ is the unique positive root of the equation $ \rho x^2 = (1-x^2) (1 -
|\alpha|x)^2,$ and $\rho$ is the ratio of the average input power per

scheme parallels the simple linear signalling scheme by Schalkwijk and Kailath
for the additive white Gaussian noise channel -- the transmitter sends a
real-valued information-bearing signal at the beginning of communication and
subsequently refines the receiver's error by processing the feedback noise
signal through a linear stationary first-order autoregressive filter. The
resulting error probability of the maximum likelihood decoding decays
doubly-exponentially in the duration of the communication. This feedback
capacity of the first-order moving average Gaussian channel is very similar in
form to the best known achievable rate for the first-order

  Submitted to the American Journal of Physics","Am.J.Phys.76:519-532,2008","10.1119/1.2830526",,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  This paper presents an under-appreciated way to conceptualize stationary
black holes, which we call the river model. The river model is mathematically
sound, yet simple enough that the basic picture can be understood by
non-experts. %that can by understood by non-experts. In the river model, space
itself flows like a river through a flat background, while objects move through
the river according to the rules of special relativity. In a spherical black
hole, the river of space falls into the black hole at the Newtonian escape
velocity, hitting the speed of light at the horizon. Inside the horizon, the
river flows inward faster than light, carrying everything with it. We show that
the river model works also for rotating (Kerr-Newman) black holes, though with
a surprising twist. As in the spherical case, the river of space can be
regarded as moving through a flat background. However, the river does not
spiral inward, as one might have anticipated, but rather falls inward with no
azimuthal swirl at all. Instead, the river has at each point not only a
velocity but also a rotation, or twist. That is, the river has a Lorentz
structure, characterized by six numbers (velocity and rotation), not just three
(velocity). As an object moves through the river, it changes its velocity and
rotation in response to tidal changes in the velocity and twist of the river
along its path. An explicit expression is given for the river field, a
six-component bivector field that encodes the velocity and twist of the river
at each point, and that encapsulates all the properties of a stationary
rotating black hole.

accreting charged black holes. In this, the first of two papers, the black hole
is assumed to accrete a charged, electrically conducting, relativistic baryonic
fluid. The mass and charge of the black hole are generated self-consistently by
the accreted material. The accreted baryonic fluid undergoes one of two
possible fates: either it plunges directly to the spacelike singularity at zero
radius, or else it drops through the Cauchy horizon. The baryons fall directly
to the singularity if the conductivity either exceeds a certain continuum
threshold kappa_oo, or else equals one of an infinite spectrum kappa_n of
discrete values. Between the discrete values kappa_n, the solution is
characterized by the number of times that the baryonic fluid cycles between
ingoing and outgoing. If the conductivity is at the continuum threshold
kappa_oo, then the solution cycles repeatedly between ingoing and outgoing,
displaying a discrete self-similarity reminiscent of that observed in critical
collapse. Below the continuum threshold kappa_oo, and except at the discrete
values kappa_n, the baryonic fluid drops through the Cauchy horizon, and in
this case undergoes a shock, downstream of which the solution terminates at an
irregular sonic point where the proper acceleration diverges, and there is no
consistent self-similar continuation to zero radius. As far as the solution can
be followed inside the Cauchy horizon, the radial direction is timelike. If the
radial direction remains timelike to zero radius (which cannot be confirmed
because the self-similar solutions terminate), then there is presumably a
spacelike singularity at zero radius inside the Cauchy horizon, which is
distinctly different from the vacuum solution for a charged black hole.

structure of self-similar accreting charged black holes. In the first paper,
the black hole was allowed to accrete only a single fluid of charged baryons.
In this second paper, the black hole is allowed to accrete in addition a
neutral fluid of almost non-interacting dark matter. Relativistic streaming
between outgoing baryons and ingoing dark matter leads to mass inflation near
the inner horizon. When enough dark matter has been accreted that the center of
mass frame near the inner horizon is ingoing, then mass inflation ceases and
the fluid collapses to a central singularity. A null singularity does not form
on the Cauchy horizon. Although the simultaneous presence of ingoing and
outgoing fluids near the inner horizon is essential to mass inflation, reducing
one or other of the ingoing dark matter or outgoing baryonic streams to a trace
relative to the other stream makes mass inflation more extreme, not the other
way round as one might naively have expected. Consequently, if the dark matter
has a finite cross-section for being absorbed into the baryonic fluid, then the
reduction of the amount of ingoing dark matter merely makes inflation more
extreme, the interior mass exponentiating more rapidly and to a larger value
before mass inflation ceases. However, if the dark matter absorption
cross-section is effectively infinite at high collision energy, so that the
ingoing dark matter stream disappears completely, then the outgoing baryonic
fluid can drop through the Cauchy horizon. In all cases, the solutions do not
depend on what happens in the infinite past or future. We discuss in some
detail the physical mechanism that drives mass inflation.

with magnetic field. Remarkably, we find that the total fermion gap, which

with magnetic field irrespectively the values of coupling constant and the

magnetic field does enhance the total fermion gap in the spectrum.

the selection of the quantum gravity vacuum. The evidence for this assertion
arises from two independent considerations. The first is the phenomenological
success of the free fermionic heterotic-string models, which are constructed in
the vicinity of the self-dual point under T-duality. The relation between the
free fermionic models and the underlying Z2 X Z2 toroidal orbifolds is
discussed. Recent analysis revealed that the Z2 X Z2 free fermionic orbifolds
utilize an asymmetric shift in the reduction to three generations, which
indicates that the untwisted geometrical moduli are fixed near the self-dual
point. The second consideration arises from the recent formulation of quantum
mechanics from an equivalence postulate and its relation to phase-space
duality. In this context it is demonstrated that the trivial state, with
V(q)=E=0, is identified with the self-dual state under phase-space duality.
These observations suggest a more general mathematical principle in operation.
In physical systems that exhibit a duality structure, the self-dual states

four), which correspond to Dowling's lattices of a group and encode an iterated

associative structure. We show that any biased expansion of a 3-connected graph

and irreducible multary quasigroups. If a 2-connected biased expansion covers
every base edge at most three times, or if every four-node minor is a group
expansion, then the whole biased expansion is a group expansion. In particular,
if a multary quasigroup has a factorization graph that is 3-connected, if it
has order 3, or if every residual ternary quasigroup is an iterated group
isotope, it is isotopic to an iterated group. We mention applications to
generalizing Dowling geometries and to transversal designs of high strength.

tangent bifurcation of the band edge modes ($q=0,\pi$) of nonlinear Hamiltonian
lattices made of $N$ coupled oscillators. Introducing the concept of {\em
partial isochronism} which characterises the way the frequency of a mode,
$\omega$, depends on its energy, $\epsilon$, we generalize these results and
show how the bifurcation energies of these modes are intimately connected to
their degree of isochronism. In particular we prove that in a lattice of
coupled purely isochronous oscillators ($\omega(\epsilon)$ strictly constant),
the in-phase mode ($q=0$) never undergoes a tangent bifurcation whereas the
out-of-phase mode ($q=\pi$) does, provided the strength of the nonlinearity in
the coupling is sufficient. We derive a discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation governing the slow modulations of small-amplitude band edge modes and
show that its nonlinear exponent is proportional to the degree of isochronism
of the corresponding orbits. This equation may be seen as a link between the
tangent bifurcation of band edge modes and the possible emergence of localized

allowing distal binding sites to act synergistically. Here we study this
process and compare different regulatory mechanisms based on repression with
and without looping. Within a simple mathematical model for the lac operon, we
show that regulation based on DNA looping, in addition to increasing the
repression level, can reduce the fluctuations of transcription and, at the same
time, decrease the sensitivity to changes in the number of regulatory proteins.
Looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to
mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a
mechanism to regulate not only the average properties of transcription but also
its fluctuations.

the quantum fluctuations of the polarization Stokes components of propagating
light and of the collective spin fluctuations of the scattering atoms. We show
that in the process of coherent forward scattering this dynamics can be
described in terms of a polariton-type spin wave created in the atomic sample.
Our work presents a general example of entangling process in the system of
collective quantum states of light and atomic angular momenta, previously
considered only for the case of spin-1/2 atoms. We use the developed general

expansion. A quantum phase is derived to bypass these shortcomings. It achieves
exact quantization of nonsolvable potentials and allows to obtain the quantum
wavefunction while locally approaching the best pre-divergent semiclassical
expansion. An iterative procedure allowing to implement practical calculations
with a modest computational cost is also given. The theory is illustrated on
two examples for which the limitations of the semiclassical approach were

interaction times, disentangles from the two modes, leaving them, in certain
cases, in entangled Schrodinger cat states. These disentanglement times can be
controlled by adjusting the ratio between average numbers of photons in the two
modes. It is also shown how this effective model may be used for implementing
quantum information processing. Especially it is demonstrated how to generate

  The explicit representation for the convex closure of the output entropy is

the convex set of states with finite output entropy. Similarly to the case of

has continuous restriction to any set of continuity of output entropy. Some
