to be hotter at a given X-ray luminosity than radio-quiet groups. We tested
three different models for the origin of the effect and conclude that
radio-source heating is the most likely explanation. We found several examples
of groups where there is strong evidence from Chandra or XMM-Newton images for

radio-source heating processes are important, including shock-heating by young

longer-lasting than the radio emission. We show that the sample of X-ray groups
used in our study is not significantly biased in the fraction of radio-loud
groups that it contains. This allows us to conclude that the energy per

comparable to the requirements of structure formation models.

indicating the presence of periodical processes possibly originating in binary
systems of supermassive black holes, in which orbital motion and precession are
ultimately responsible for the observed broad-band emission variations, as well
as for the morphological and kinematic properties of the radio emission on
parsec scales. This scenario, applied to the quasar 3C345, explains the
observed variations of radio and optical emission from the quasar, and
reproduces the structural variations observed in the parsec-scale jet of this
object. The binary system in 3C345 is described by two equal-mass black holes
with masses of approximately 7*10^8 solar masses separated by ~0.33 pc and
orbiting with a period of ~480 yr. The orbital motion induces a precession of
the accretion disk around the primary black hole, with a period of ~2570 yr.
The jet plasma is described by a magnetized, relativistic electron-positron
beam propagating inside a wider and slower electron-proton jet. The combination
of Alfven wave perturbations of the beam, the orbital motion of the binary
system and the precession of the accretion disk reproduces the variability of
the optical flux and evolution of the radio structure in 3C345. The timescale
of quasi-periodic flaring activity in 3C345 is consistent with typical disk
instability timescales. The present model cannot rule out a small-mass orbiter
crossing the accretion disk and causing quasi-periodic flares.

objects of which 54 have sufficient signal-to-noise to detect NaI at an
equivalent width of 3Angstroms, however we only detect NaI in 38 of these. This
implies that very low-mass members of this young group display weaker NaI
absorption than similarly aged objects in the Upper Scorpius OB association. We
develop a technique to assess membership using radial velocities with a range
of uncertainties that does not bias the selection when large uncertainties are
present. The resulting membership probabilities are used to assess the issue of
exclusion in photometric selections, and we find that very few members are
likely to be excluded by such techniques.
  We also assess the level of contamination in the expected pre-main sequence
region of colour-magnitude space brighter than I = 17. We find that
contamination by non-members in the expected PMS region of the colour-magnitude

insufficient to confirm membership, high signal-to-noise observations of the

concert with radial velocities to asses membership down to the lowest masses,
where Lithium absorption no longer distinguishes youth.

hybrid tridimensional simulation code, as a valid practical alternative to full
Monte Carlo simulations of extensive air showers generated by ultra-high energy

time consuming, full Monte Carlo code CORSIKA which is the de facto standard in
the field. The hybrid scheme of the SENECA code is based on the simulation of
each particle with the traditional Monte Carlo method at two steps of the
shower development: the first step predicts the large fluctuations in the very
first particle interactions at high energies while the second step provides a
well detailed lateral distribution simulation of the final stages of the air
shower. Both Monte Carlo simulation steps are connected by a cascade equation
system which reproduces correctly the hadronic and electromagnetic longitudinal
profile. We study the influence of this approach on the main longitudinal
characteristics of proton-induced air showers and compare the predictions of

HST/ACS coronagraph, using a 1.8'' occulting spot and the F606W (broad V) and
F814W (broad I) filters. Within 2'' from the star, the image is dominated by
PSF subtraction residuals. Outside this limit, the disk looks featureless
except for a northeast-southwest brightness asymmetry that we attribute to
forward scattering. The disk has scattered-light fractional luminosities of
$(L_{Sca}/L_*)_{F606W}=6.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{-5}$ and
$(L_{Sca}/L_*)_{F814W}=10 \pm 1 \times 10^{-5}$ and it is detected up to 6.5''

$25^\circ \pm 5^\circ$, divide by the dust scattering phase ($g_{F606W} = 0.3
\pm 0.1$, $g_{F814W} = 0.2 \pm 0.1$) and correct for the geometric dilution of
starlight. Within the errors, the surface density has the same shape in each
bandpass, and it appears to be a broad (85 AU) ring with most of the opacity
concentrated at 130 AU. The ratio of the relative luminosity in F814W to that
in F606W has the constant value of $1.3\pm0.3$, with the error dominated by
uncertainties in the value of $g$ in each filter. An examination of far
infrared and submillimeter measurements suggests the presence of small grains.
The colors and the derived values of $g$ are consistent with the presence of
dust particles smaller than the radiation pressure limit. The dust generated by
the creation of a small planet or the scattering and circularization of a large
one, are possible scenarios that may explain the shape of the surface density
profile.

transfer through the ongoing X-ray phase, tidal circularization before the
onset of Roche-lobe overflow, motion through the Galactic potential after the

modeling of the core collapse. We apply the analysis to the soft X-ray
transient GRO J1655-40 and, for the first time, use its full 3D peculiar
velocity constraints right after core collapse instead of lower limits on the
current space velocity given by the present-day radial velocity. We find that
the system has remained within 200pc from the Galactic plane throughout its
entire life time and that the mass loss and a kick possibly associated with the
black hole (BH) formation imparted a kick velocity of 45-115 km/s to the
binary's center of mass. Right after BH formation, the system consists of a
3.5-6.3 Msun BH and a 2.3-4 Msun main-sequence star. At the onset of the X-ray
phase the donor is still on the main sequence. We find that a symmetric BH
formation event cannot be formally excluded, but that the associated system
parameters are only marginally consistent with the currently observed binary
properties. BH formation mechanisms involving an asymmetric supernova explosion
with associated BH kick velocities of a few tens of km/s, on the other hand,
satisfy the constraints much more comfortably. We also derive an upper limit on

neutral Hydrogen distribution provide a probe of physics related to the era of
reionization when the intergalactic medium changed from a completely neutral to
a partially ionized one. We formulate statistics of 21 cm brightness
temperature anisotropies in terms of the angular power spectrum, the
bispectrum, and the trispectrum. Using the trispectrum, we estimate the
covariance related to the power spectrum measurements and show that
correlations resulting from non-Gaussianities are below a percent, at most.
While all-sky observations of the 21 cm background at arcminute-scale
resolution can be used to measure the bispectrum with a cumulative
signal-to-noise ratio of order a few ten, in the presence of foregrounds and
instrumental noise related to first-generation interferometers, the measurement
is unlikely to be feasible. For most purposes, non-Gaussianities in 21 cm
fluctuations can be ignored and the distribution can be described with Gaussian
statistics. Since 21 cm fluctuations are significantly contaminated by
foregrounds, such as galactic synchrotron or low-frequency radio point sources,
the lack of a significant non-Gaussianity in the signal suggests that any
significant detection of a non-Gaussianity can be due to foregrounds.
Similarly, in addition to frequency information that is now proposed to
separate 21 cm fluctuations from foregrounds, if the non-Gaussian structure of
foregrounds is a priori known, one can potentially use this additional
information to further reduce the confusion.

confusion with real point sources. Such background emission confusion will be
important for infrared observations with relatively large beam sizes since the
amount of fluctuation tends to increase with angular scale. In order to
quantitively assess the effect of the background emission on the detection of
point sources for current and future far-infrared observations by space-borne
missions such as Spitzer, ASTRO-F, Herschel and SPICA, we have extended the
Galactic emission map to higher angular resolution than the currently available
data. Using this high resolution map, we estimate the sky confusion noise due
to the emission from interstellar dust clouds or cirrus, based on fluctuation
analysis and detailed photometry over realistically simulated images. We find
that the confusion noise derived by simple fluctuation analysis agrees well
with the result from realistic simulations. Although the sky confusion noise
becomes dominant in long wavelength bands (> 100 um) with 60 - 90cm aperture
missions, it is expected to be two order of magnitude smaller for the next
generation space missions with larger aperture sizes such as Herschel and
SPICA.

there is little connection between the two emission mechanisms and is
consistent with the near-infrared emission being dominated by starlight rather
than a Seyfert non-stellar continuum.
  Near-infrared X-ray sources make up roughly half of all extremely red (J-H >
1.4) objects brighter than H > 24.5. These red X-ray sources have a range of
hardness ratios similar to the rest of the sample, decreasing the likelihood of
dust-obscured AGN activity as the sole explanation for their red color. Using a
combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, we find the red J-H
objects are at high redshifts (z > 1.5), which we propose as the primary
explanation for their extreme J-H color. Measurement of rest-wavelength
absolute B magnitudes shows that X-ray sources are the brightest optical

on the western edge of the super-shell LMC 4, and a field between two
associations, which is located on the southwestern edge of the shell, and which
accounts for the general background field of the galaxy. The HST/WFPC2
observations reach magnitudes as faint as V=25 mag, much deeper than have been
observed earlier in stellar associations in the LMC. We determine the MF for
main-sequence stars in the areas. Its slope (Gamma) in both areas is steeper
for stars with masses M < 2 M_solar (-4 < Gamma < -6), compared with stars of M
> 2 M_solar (-1 < Gamma < -2). Thus, as far as the field of the LMC concerns
the MF does not have a uniform slope throughout its observed mass range. The MF
of the general field of the LMC was found previously to be steeper than the MF
of a stellar association for massive stars with M > 5 M_solar. We conclude that
this seems to be also the case toward lower masses down to M ~ 1 M_solar. Our
data allow to construct the field-subtracted, incompleteness-corrected,
main-sequence MF of the southwestern part of the young stellar association LH
52, which accounts for the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the system. Its mean
slope is found to be comparable, but still more shallow than a typical Salpeter
IMF (Gamma = -1.12 +/- 0.24) for masses down to ~ 1 M_solar. We found
indications that the IMF of the association probably is ``top-heavy'', due to
the large number of intermediate-mass stars in the field of the system, while
the general LMC field is found to be responsible for the low-mass population,
with M < 2 M_solar, observed in both fields.

the localized d$^4$ character, which is further enhanced by the distortion. The
lower symmetry should be detectable experimentally in cubic GaN with low Mn

diffusive normal metal / insulator / triplet superconductor (DN/TS) junction is
studied based on the Keldysh-Nambu quasiclassical Green's function formalism.
By choosing a p-wave superconductor as a typical example of TS, conductance of
the junction and the spatial variation of quasiparticle local density of states
(LDOS) in DN are calculated as the function of the magnitudes of the resistance
$R_{d}$, Thouless energy in DN and the transparency of the insulating barrier.
The resulting conductance spectrum has a zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) and
LDOS has a zero energy peak (ZEP) except for $\alpha = \pi/2$ $(0 \leq \alpha
\leq \pi/2)$, where $\alpha$ denotes the angle between the lobe direction of
the p-wave pair potential to the normal to the interface. These peaks are
revealed to be suppressed by applying a magnetic field. When the magnitude of
$R_{d}/R_{0}$ is sufficiently large, the total zero voltage resistance of the
junction is almost independent of the $R_{d}$ for $\alpha \neq \pi/2$. The
extreme case is $\alpha=0$, where total zero voltage resistance is always
$R_{0}/2$. Based on these results, a crucial test to identify triplet pairing
superconductors based on tunneling experiments is proposed.

provides scalable, decentralized load balancing for distributed computing using
large-scale pools of heterogeneous computers. Fundamentally, BON encodes the
information about each node's available computational resources in the
structure of the links connecting the nodes in the network. This distributed
encoding is self-organized, with each node managing its in-degree and local
connectivity via random-walk sampling. Assignment of incoming jobs to nodes
with the most free resources is also accomplished by sampling the nodes via
short random walks. Extensive simulations show that the resulting highly
dynamic and self-organized graph structure can efficiently balance
computational load throughout large-scale networks. These simulations cover a
wide spectrum of cases, including significant heterogeneity in available
computing resources and high burstiness in incoming load. We provide analytical
results that prove BON's scalability for truly large-scale networks: in
particular we show that under certain ideal conditions, the network structure
converges to Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graphs; our simulation results, however,
show that the algorithm does much better, and the structures seem to approach
the ideal case of d-regular random graphs. We also make a connection between
highly-loaded BONs and the well-known ball-bin randomized load balancing

down and the MC method seems to be the only practical alternative. We discuss
the possibility of using a modified version of perturbation theory which relies
on a large field cutoff and has been successfully applied to the double-well
potential (Y. M., PRL 88 141601). Generically, in the case of scalar field
theory, the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential
suppression of the large field configurations. This problem can be solved by
introducing a large field cutoff. The value of this cutoff can be chosen to
reduce the discrepancy with the original problem. This optimization can be
approximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and bridges the gap
between the two expansions. We report recent attempts to extend this procedure
for SU(3) gauge theory on the lattice. We compare gauge invariant and gauge
dependent (in the Landau gauge) criteria to sort the configurations into
``large-field'' and ``small-field'' configurations. %We discuss the effects of
discarding the large field configurations. We discuss the convergence of
lattice perturbation theory and the way it can be modified in order to obtain
results similar to the scalar case.

in the 10 TeV range we obtain the upper bounds of $|d_e|< 9\times 10^{-30}$

Transverse photon exchange contributes at leading order to the binding energy

the associated Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg (BKS) pairing map is unitary and
coincides with the parallel transport of the quantum connection introduced in
our previous work, from the point of view of \cite{AdPW}. The BKS pairing map
is a composition of (unitary) coherent state transforms of $K$, introduced in
\cite{Ha1}. Continuity of the Hermitian structure on the quantum bundle, in the
limit when one of the K\""ahler polarizations degenerates to the vertical real
polarization, leads to the unitarity of the corresponding BKS pairing map. This
is in agreement with the unitarity up to scaling (with respect to a rescaled
inner product) of this pairing map, established by Hall.

  Stellenbosch, South Africa",,,,"nucl-th cond-mat.supr-con",,"  Generalised Dyson boson-fermion mappings are considered. These are techniques
used in the analysis of the quantum many-body problem, and are instances of
so-called boson expansion methods. A generalised Dyson boson-fermion mapping is
a one-to-one linear but non-unitary operator that can be applied to vectors
representing the states of a many-fermion system. A vector representing a
fermion system maps onto a vector that represents a state of a many-body system
that contains both bosons and fermions. The motivation for doing such a mapping
is the hope that it will reveal some property of the system that simplifies its
analysis and that was hidden in the original form. The aims of this text are to
review the theory of generalized Dyson boson-fermion mappings and to find a
useful application for a generalized Dyson boson-fermion mapping, by
considering a non-trivial model, namely the Richardson model for
superconductivity. It is the first time that a boson expansion technique is
implemented for a system where the roles of both collective and non-collective
fermion pairs are important. The Dyson mapping uncovers non-trivial properties
of the system that aid the construction of time-independent as well as
time-dependent perturbation expansions. The time-independent expansions agree
with results that other authors have obtained through methods other than boson
expansions. The time-dependent expansions might in future prove useful in
understanding aspects of the dynamics of ultra-cold fermi gases, when
time-dependent magnetic fields are used to vary the atom-atom interaction
strenght.

the interaction of intense laser light with overdense plasma and in particular,
aspects of the harmonic emission spectrum generated in these interactions.
Recent observations of emission in this range by Watts et al. (2002) show
emission above the 20th harmonic extending to the 37th with conversion
efficiencies of order 10^-6 with this spectrum showing distinct, if variable,
modulation of between two and four harmonics. This spectral feature proved
highly sensitive to the incident intensity, with more pronounced modulation at
higher intensities. These authors also reported results from a set of model PIC
simulations which showed a modulated emission spectrum across the entire
harmonic range, but with a wider modulation bandwidth. In the results to be
presented we report on features of the emission spectrum across a wide
parameter range and its dependence on the detailed structure of the plasma
density profile. While we do see evidence of a modulated spectrum, this appears
to be sensitive not only to the incident intensity but to the plasma density
profile. In addition plasma emission present further complicates the harmonic
emission spectrum. Our results lead us to conclude that attempts to interpret
modulation in emission spectra in terms of one particular theoretical model and
from this to infer the dynamics of the critical surface may be misguided.

cannot be modified to properly represent biased diffusion processes in more

the fact that traditional Monte Carlo moves do not allow for simultaneous jumps
along each spatial direction. We thus propose a new algorithm to transform
biased diffusion problems into lattice random walks such that we recover the
proper dynamics for any number of spatial dimensions and for arbitrary values
of the external field. Using a hypercubic lattice, we redefine the basic Monte
Carlo moves, including the transition probabilities and the corresponding time
durations, in order to allow for simultaneous jumps along all Cartesian axes.
We show that our new algorithm can be used both with computer simulations and
with exact numerical methods to obtain the mean velocity and the diffusion
coefficient of point-like particles in any dimensions and in the presence of

from the SWISS-PROT database were analyzed for thirteen eukaryotes, eight
bacteria, and two archaea species. The number of subcellular locations to which
each protein is associated is used as a measure of the number of interactions
to which a protein participates. Two databases of yeast protein-protein
interactions were used as another measure of the number of interactions to
which each \emph{S. cerevisiae} protein participates. Protein length is shown
to correlate with both number of subcellular locations to which a protein is
associated and number of interactions as measured by yeast two-hybrid
experiments. Protein length is also shown to correlate with the probability
that the protein is encoded by an essential gene. Interestingly, average
protein length and number of subcellular locations are not significantly
different between all human proteins and protein targets of known, marketed
drugs. Increased protein length appears to be a significant mechanism by which
the increasing complexity of protein-protein interaction networks is
accommodated within the natural evolution of species. Consideration of protein
length may be a valuable tool in drug design, one that predicts different
strategies for inhibiting interactions in aberrant and normal pathways.

between the $m$-mode and the $n$-mode blocks can then be completely
concentrated on a single pair of modes by means of local unitary operations
alone. This result allows to prove that the PPT (positivity of the partial

identify a subset of bisymmetric states whose multimode entanglement of
formation can be computed analytically. We consider explicit examples of pure

threshold translates to an ~13X penalty in the amplitude and timing of gate

populations is an important problem with applications to Quantum Chemistry and
Atomic Physics. In this work we consider exact population transfers that
minimize the L^2 norm of the control which is typically the amplitude of an
electromagnetic field. This problem is analytically and numerically
challenging. Except for few exactly solvable cases, there is no general
understanding of the nature of optimal controls and trajectories. We find that
by examining the limit of large transfer times, we can uncover such general
properties. In particular, for transfer times large with respect to the time
scale of the free dynamics of the quantum system, the optimal control is a sum
of components, each being a Bohr frequency sinusoid modulated by a slow
amplitude, i.e. a profile that changes considerably only on the scale of the
transfer time. Moreover, we show that the optimal trajectory follows a ""mean''
evolution modulated by the fast free dynamics of the system. The calculation of
the ""mean'' optimal trajectory and the slow control profiles is done via an
""averaged'' two-point boundary value problem which we derive and which is much
easier to solve than the one expressing the necessary conditions for optimality
of the original optimal transfer problem.

analyze the detection scheme in the context of an optical implementation of the

gate's success probability to be traded away for improved gate fidelity,
assuming high efficiency detectors. The scheme is compared to two other
proposals, both deterministic, for approximating discriminating detectors using
non-discriminating detectors: the cascade and time division multiplexing
schemes.

optimize the stochastic paths and reduce statistical fluctuations. In the
proposed method, called the 'adaptative noise method', a specific SSE is
obtained for which the noise depends explicitly on both the initial state and
on the properties of the interaction Hamiltonian. It is also shown that this
method can be further improved by introduction of a mean-field dynamics. The
different optimization procedures are illustrated quantitatively in the case of
interacting spins. A significant reduction of the statistical fluctuations is
obtained. Consequently a much smaller number of trajectories is needed to
accurately reproduce the exact dynamics as compared to the SSE without
optimization.
