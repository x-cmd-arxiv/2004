ApJ Letters, in press","Astrophys.J. 621 (2005) L41-L44","10.1086/429146",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  We investigate the effects of gravitational lensing in the binary pulsar
system J0737-3039. Current measurement of the orbital inclination allows the
millisecond pulsar (A) to pass very close (at R_{min}=4000 km) in projection to
the companion pulsar (B), with R_{min} comparable to the Einstein radius (2600
km). For this separation at the conjunction, lensing causes small (about 10%)
magnification of the pulsar A signal on a timescale of several seconds, and
displaces the pulsar image on the sky plane by about 1200 km. More importantly,
lensing introduces a correction (of several microsec) to the conventional
Shapiro delay formula used in pulsar timing analysis, and gives rise to a
geometric time delay together with the delays associated with the pulsar spin
period. These lensing effects can influence the determination of the system
parameters by both timing and scintillation studies. Given the current
uncertainty in the orbital inclination, more extreme manifestations of lensing
(e.g. magnification by a factor of several) are possible. We compare our
predictions with the existing observations and discuss the possibility of
detecting gravitational lensing signatures in the system. The anomalously high
point in A's lightcurve close to superior conjunction might be caused by
gravitational lensing.

AFGL5180) and G 192.60-0.05 (S255IR). These radio-quiet methanol maser sites
are often interpreted as precursors of ultra-compact \ion{H}{ii} regions or
massive protostar sites. In this work, the environment of methanol masers is
probed from mid-IR to millimetre wavelengths at angular resolutions of
$8''-34''$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) diagrams for each site are
presented, together with mass and luminosity estimates. Each radio-quiet maser
site is always associated with a massive ($>50$ M$_{\odot}$), deeply embedded
($A_v>40$ mag) and very luminous ($>10^4$ S L$_{\odot}$) molecular clump, with
$L_{total}{\propto}M_{gas}^{0.75}$. These physical properties characterise
massive star-forming clumps in earlier evolutionary phases than \ion{H}{ii}
regions. In addition, colder gas clumps seen only at mm-wavelengths are also
found near the methanol maser sites. These colderclumps may represent an even
earlier phase of massive star formation. These results suggest an evolutionary
sequence for massive star formation from a cold clump, seen only at mm
wavelengths, evolving to a hot molecular core with a two-component SED with
peaks at far-IR and mid-IR wavelengths, to an (ultra-compact) \ion{H}{ii}
region. Alternatively, the cold clumps might be clusters of low-mass YSOs, in
formation near the massive star-forming clusters. Finally, the values of the
dust grain emissivity index ($\beta$) range between 1.6 and 1.9.

analysis of Li7 observations in halo stars, using significantly higher surface
temperature for these stars, found a higher Li plateau abundance. These results
go a long way towards resolving the discrepancy with BBN. Here, we examine the
implications of the higher surface temperatures on the abundances of Be and B
which are thought to have been produced in galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis
by spallation of CNO together with Li (produced in alpha + alpha collisions).
While the Be abundance is not overly sensitive to the surface temperature, the
derived B abundances and more importantly the derived oxygen abundances are
very temperature dependent. If the new temperature scale is correct, the
implied increased abundances of these elements poses a serious challenge to
models of galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution.

very massive stars (M > 100 Msun, pair-creation SNe) on the chemical and
photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies. To this purpose, we have computed
the evolution of a typical elliptical galaxy with luminous mass of the order of
10^11 Msun and adopted chemical evolution models already tested to reproduce
the main features of ellipticals. We have tested several sets of yields for
very massive zero-metallicity stars: these stars should produce quite different
amounts of heavy elements than lower mass stars. We found that the effects of
population III stars on the chemical enrichment is negligible if only one or
two generations of such stars occurred, whereas they produce quite different
results from the standard models if they continuously formed for a period not
shorter than 0.1 Gyr. In this case, the results are at variance with the main
observational constraints of ellipticals such as the average [<alpha/Fe>] ratio
in stars and the integrated colors. Therefore, we conclude that if population
III stars ever existed they must have been present for a very short period of
time and their effects on the following evolution of the parent galaxy must
have been negligible. This effect is minimum if a more realistic model with
initial infall of gas rather than the classic monolithic model is adopted.
Ultimately, we conclude that there is no need to invoke a generation of very
massive stars in ellipticals to explain their chemical and photometric
properties.

distribution (SED) templates, we propose to subtract the typical energy

radiation. The resulting SED reveals that the main dust emission is well fitted
by the sum of two blackbody components at the respective temperatures 340K+-50K
and 40K+-16K. When the AGN is active, the energy rate released by hot dust is
much more dissipative than cold dust and stellar emission, even when the
elliptical galaxy emission is maximum at age of ~ 90 Myr. Hot dust appears as a
huge cooling source which implies an extremely short time-scale t(cool). In
balance, with the short gravitational time-scale t(grav) of massive galaxies,
the dissipative self-gravitational models (Rees & Ostriker, 1977) are favoured
for radio sources. They justify the existence of massive radio galaxies at z=4
(Rocca-Volmerange et al., 2004). The synchrotron emission is emitting up to the
X-ray wavelength range, so that strong ""EXOs"" sources could be assimilated to
3CR radio sources. This analysis applied to ISO and SPITZER data on a larger

l. Our existing sample chains are only long enough to achieve convergence at l
less than about 40. In comparison with P(C_l|d) as reported by the WMAP team we
find significant differences at these low l values. These differences lead to
up to approximately 0.5 sigma shifts in the estimates of parameters in a

such a system is quite unstable due to the attractive portion of the dipolar
interaction. However, by reversing the sign of the dipolar interaction using
either a rotating magnetic field or a laser with circular polarization, a
stable cigar-shaped configuration can be achieved whose spectrum contains a
`roton' minimum analogous to that found in helium II. Dipolar gases also offer
the exciting prospect to tune the depth of this `roton' minimum by directly
controlling the interparticle interaction strength. When the minimum touches
the zero-energy axis the system is once again unstable, possibly to the
formation of a density wave.

Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation are investigated. Transport is found to be
anomalous with a non linear evolution of the second moments with time. The
origin of this anomaly is traced back to the presence of chaotic jets within
the flow. All characteristic transport exponents have a similar value around
$\mu=1.75$, which is also the one found for simple point vortex flows in the
literature, indicating some kind of universality. Moreover the law
$\gamma=\mu+1$ linking the trapping time exponent within jets to the transport
exponent is confirmed and an accumulation towards zero of the spectrum of
finite time Lyapunov exponent is observed. The localization of a jet is
performed, and its structure is analyzed. It is clearly shown that despite a
regular coarse grained picture of the jet, motion within the jet appears as
chaotic but chaos is bounded on successive small scales.

experiments. RHIC is a collider built to accelerate nuclei to center of mass
energies of 200 GeV per nucleon for the study of QCD in bulk systems. The most
important result so far is the observation of the suppression of high p$_T$
hadrons in central Au-Au collisions followed by the subsequent null experiment
where the same suppression was not seen in deuteron-Au collisions. The observed
suppression is a final state effect in which a large amount of energy is lost
by the fast parton as it penetrates the medium. This observation, together with
measurements of the elliptic flow, leads to the conclusion that the energy
density reached is at least 10 times that of a normal nucleon. The simplest and
most economical explanation of these phenomenon is that the system is a dense,
locally thermalized system of unscreened color charges.

diffusion. The efficiency of such reactions can be improved through an increase
in the arrival rate of the substrate molecules, e.g. by a directed passage of
substrate (ligand) to active site after its random encounter with the enzyme
surface. Herein, we introduce a cellular automata model simulating the ligand
passage over the protein surface to its destined active site. The system is
simulated using the lattice gas automata with probabilistic transition rules.
Different distributions of amino acids over the protein surface are examined.
For each distribution, the hydration pattern is achieved and the mean number of
iteration steps needed for the ligand to arrive at the active site calculated.
Comparison of results indicates that the rate at which ligand arrives at the
active site is clearly affected by the distribution of amino acids outside the
active side. Such a process can facilitate the ligand diffusion towards the
active site thereby enhancing the efficiency of the enzyme action.

Results obtained within the scope of the Miyazawa-Jernigan indicate the

sensitive to the native state's conformation. Smaller chains, with less than 80
amino acids, fold via two-state kinetics and exhibit a significant correlation
between the contact order parameter and the logarithmic folding times. In
particular, chains with N=48 amino acids were found to belong to two broad
classes of folding, characterized by different cooperativity, depending on the
contact order parameter. Preliminary results based on the G\={o} model show
that the effect of long range contact interaction strength in the folding
kinetics is largely dependent on the native state's geometry.

in determining the folding rates of 48-mer three-dimensional lattice polymers

geometries we found a sharp increase in the folding time when the relative
contribution of the long-range interactions to the native state's energy is
decreased from ~50% towards zero. However, the dispersion of the simulated
folding times depends strongly on the native geometry and Go polymers folding
to one of the target structures exhibit folding times spanning three orders of
magnitude. We have also found that, depending on the target geometry, a strong
geometric coupling may exist between local and long-range contacts meaning
that, when this coupling exists, the formation of long-range contacts is forced
by the previous formation of local contacts. The absence of a strong geometric
coupling leads to kinetics that are more sensitive to the interaction energy
parameters; in this case the formation of local contacts is not sufficient to
promote the establishment of long-range ones when these are strongly penalized
energetically, leading to longer folding times.

models on a state space, comprising joint probability distributions for
character types of taxonomic classes. Phylogenetic branching is a process which
augments the number of taxa under consideration, and hence the rank of the
underlying joint probability state tensor. We point out the combinatorial
necessity for a second-quantised, or Fock space setting, incorporating discrete
counting labels for taxa and character types, to allow for a description in the
number basis. Rate operators describing both time evolution without branching,
and also phylogenetic branching events, are identified. A detailed development
of these ideas is given, using standard transcriptions from the microscopic
formulation of nonequilibrium reaction-diffusion or birth-death processes.
These give the relations between stochastic rate matrices, the matrix elements
of the corresponding evolution operators representing them, and the integral
kernels needed to implement these as path integrals. The `free' theory (without
branching) is solved, and the correct trilinear `interaction' terms
(representing branching events) are presented. The full model is developed in
perturbation theory via the derivation of explicit Feynman rules which
establish that the probabilities (pattern frequencies of leaf colourations)
arising as matrix elements of the time evolution operator are identical with
those computed via the standard analysis. Simple examples (phylogenetic trees
with 2 or 3 leaves), are discussed in detail. Further implications for the work
are briefly considered including the role of time reparametrisation covariance.
