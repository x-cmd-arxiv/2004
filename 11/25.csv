  redshift of quasars","One insignificant correction, 19 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In a series of articles, we have shown that the newly discovered
plasma-redshift cosmology gives a simpler, more accurate and consistent
explanation of many cosmological phenomena than the big-bang cosmology. The SNe
Ia observations are in better agreement with the magnitude-redshift relation
predicted by the plasma redshift than that predicted by the multi-parameter
big-bang cosmology. No deceleration or expansion parameters are needed. The
plasma-redshift cosmology is flat and quasi-static on a large scale. The Hubble
constant is no longer an expansion parameter, but is instead a measure of the
average electron density along the line of sight towards an object. Perusal of
the SNe Ia data and quasar data has shown that there is no time dilation. The
conventional estimates of the Hubble constant from gravitational lensing
observations use the big-bang cosmology for interpreting the observations. This
has lead to a large spread and discordant estimates of the Hubble constant. The
purpose of the present article is to show that the gravitational lensing
observations are in agreement with the plasma-redshift cosmology, and to show
how to evaluate the lensing observations based on the new plasma-redshift
cosmology. The lensing observations also indicate that the quasars have large
intrinsic redshifts.

  The effects of rotation on pre-supernova models are significant between 15

colour of the supernova progenitors (blue instead of red supergiant) and the
supernova type (IIb or Ib instead of II). Rotation increases the helium and CO
core sizes by a factor about 1.5. Thus, rotation increases the total metallic
yields and in particular the yields for carbon and oxygen by a factor 1.5-2.5.
  For Wolf-Rayet stars (M>30 solar masses), rotation increases the yields of
helium and other hydrogen burning products but does not significantly affect
the yields of heavy elements.

just ordinary matter as in Newtonian Physics. This fact can be seen in the
modified hydrostatic equilibrium equation for relativistic stars pervaded by
magnetic (B) fields. It has an additional term coupled to the matter part as
well as an anisotropic term which is purely of magnetic origin. That additional
term coming from the pressure changed by the radial component of the diagonal
electromagnetic field tensor, weakens the gravitational force when B is strong
enough and can even produce an unexpected change in the attractive nature of
the force by reversing its sign. In an extreme case, this new general
relativistic (GR) effect can even trigger an instability in the star as a
consequence of the sudden reversal of the hydrostatic pressure gradient. We
suggest here that this GR effect may be the possible central engine driving the
transient giant outbursts observed in Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs). In small
regions of the neutron star (NS), strong magnetic condensation can take place.
Beyond a critical limit, these highly magnetised bubbles may explode releasing
the trapped energy as a burst of gamma-rays of ~ 10^{36-40} erg.

and v=2, J=1-0 SiO masers toward TX Cam at four epochs covering a stellar
cycle. Near maser maximum (Epochs III and IV), the individual components of
both masers are distributed in ring-like structures but the ring is severely
disrupted near stellar maser minimum (Epochs I and II). In Epochs III and IV
there is a large overlap between the radii at which the two maser transitions
occur. However in both epochs the average radius of the v=2 maser ring is
smaller than for the v=1 maser ring, the difference being larger for Epoch IV.
The observed relative ring radii in the two transitions, and the trends on the
ring thickness, are close to those predicted by the model of Humphreys et al.
(\cite{humphreys02}). In many individual features there is an almost exact
overlap in space and velocity of emission from the two transitions, arguing
against pure radiative pumping. At both Epochs III and IV in many spectral
features only 50% of the flux density is recovered in our images, implying
significant smooth maser structure. For both transitions we find that red- and
blue-shifted masers occur in all parts of the rings, with relatively few masers
at the systemic velocity. Thus there is no evidence for rotation, although the
blue-shifted masers are somewhat more prominent to the west. At all four epochs
red-shifted components are generally brighter than blue-shifted ones. At Epochs
III and IV, we see many filamentary or spoke-like features in both v=1 and v=2
masers, especially in the red-shifted gas. These spokes show systematic
velocity gradients consistent with a decelerating outward flow with increasing
radius. We outline a possible model to explain why, given the presence of these
spokes, there is a deficit of maser features at the systemic velocity.

stellar spiral pattern was studied in previous work (see Martos et al. 2004).
It is a sensitive function of the pattern rotation speed, $\Omega_p$, among
other parameters which include the mass in the spiral and its pitch angle. Here
we further discuss the complex gaseous response found there for plausible
values of $\Omega_p$ in our Galaxy, and argue that its value must be close to

study the gas response to the stellar (K band) 2-armed pattern. For our best
fit values, the gaseous response to the 2-armed pattern displayed in the K band
is a four-armed pattern with complex features in the interarm regions. This
response resembles the optical arms observed in the Milky Way and other

mass components, an exponential thin stellar disk and a dark halo for which we
alternatively assume one of the two most common mass distributions. We
construct its generic rotation curve, with two free parameters linked to its
shape and one to its amplitude, namely the halo characteristic scale lenght,
the fractional amount of Dark Matter and the total mass at one disk scale
lenght. We find that there is no need of a fine-tuning in the above parameters
to produce smooth, featureless rotation curves like the ones actually observed.
The rotation curves obtained from different mass distributions are
significanlty affected by the variation of the parameters, and show substantial
difference in their slope; however, they do not feature irregularities marking
the transition from a disk-dominated to a halo-dominated regime. On the other
hand we show, by direct analysis of a large number of plausible and different
mass models, that an observed rotation curve fulfilling well defined quality
requirements can be uniquely and properly decomposed in its dark and luminous
components; through a suitable mass modelling together with a
maximum-likelihood fitting method, in fact, the disentangling of the mass
components is accomplished with a very high resolution.

stationary state of a Markovian model for bipartite multigraphs, in which the
movement of the edge ends on one set of vertices of the bipartite graph is a
zero-range process, the degrees being static on the other set. The analysis is
based on approximations by independent variables and on the results of Molloy
and Reed for graphs with prescribed degree sequences. The possible types of
phase diagrams are identified by studying the behavior below the zero-range
condensation point. As a specific example, we consider the so-called Evans
interaction. In particular, we examine the values of a critical exponent,
describing the growth of the giant component as the value of the dilution
parameter controlling the connectivity is increased above the critical
threshold. Rigorous analysis spans a large portion of the parameter space of
the model exactly at the point of zero-range condensation. These results,
supplemented with conjectures supported by Monte Carlo simulations, suggest
that the phenomenological Landau theory for percolation on graphs is not broken
by the fluctuations.

find that the superconducting instability always occurs before the pairing

have discovered several new results: (1) It is better to generate exact parton
kinematics in the hard scattering rather than with the subsequent parton
showering, and similarly at each step of the showering. (2) Parton showering is
then done conditionally on the exact energy-momentum of the initiating parton.

  Russia, September 7-11, 2004",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The off mass shell continuation of dual amplitude with Mandelstam analyticity
(DAMA) is proposed. The modified DAMA (M-DAMA) preserves all the attractive
properties of DAMA, such as its pole structure and Regge asymptotics, and leads
to a generalized dual amplitude A(s,t,Q^2). In such a way we complete a unified
""two-dimensionally dual"" picture of strong interaction. This generalized
amplitude can be checked in the known kinematical limits, i.e. it should reduce
to the ordinary dual amplitude on mass shell, and to the nuclear structure
function when t=0. We fix the Q^2-dependence in M-DAMA by comparing the
structure function F_2, resulting from it, with phenomenological
parameterizations. The results of M-DAMA are in qualitative agreement with the
experiment in all studied regions, i.e. in the large and low x limits as well
as in the resonance region.

ensembles of random matrices in the scaling limit for a class of weights
w(x)=exp(-V(x)) where V is a polynomial, V(x)=kappa_{2m}x^{2m}+...,

on a single interval. The precise statement of our results is given in Theorem
1.1 below. For a proof of the Universality Conjecture for unitary ensembles,
for the same class of weights, see [DKMVZ2].
  Our starting point is Widom's representation [W] of the orthogonal and
symplectic correlation kernels in terms of the kernel arising in the unitary
case plus a correction term which is constructed out of derivatives and
integrals of orthonormal polynomials (OP's) {p_j(x)}, j=0,1,..., with respect
to the weight w(x). The calculations in [W] in turn depend on the earlier work
of Tracy and Widom [TW2]. It turns out (see [W] and also Theorems 2.1 and 2.2
below) that only the OP's in the range j=N+O(1), N->infinity, contribute to the
correction term. In controlling this correction term, and hence proving
Universality for both the orthogonal and symplectic cases, the uniform
Plancherel--Rotach type asymptotics for the OP's found in [DKMVZ2] play an
important role, but there are significant new analytical difficulties that must
be overcome which are not present in the unitary case. We note that we do not
use skew orthogonal polynomials.

called (non-commutative) continuous Bernoulli shifts. These shifts encode
stochastic independence in terms of commuting squares, as they are familiar in
subfactor theory. Such shifts are, in particular, capable of producing
Arveson's product system of type I and type II. We investigate the structure of
these shifts and prove that the von Neumann algebra of a (scalar-expected)
continuous Bernoulli shift is either finite or of type III.
  The role of (`classical') stationary flows for Tsirelson-Vershik's noises is
now played by cocycles of continuous Bernoulli shifts. We show that these
cocycles provide an operator algebraic notion for Levy processes. They lead, in
particular, to units and `logarithms' of units in Arveson's product systems.
Furthermore, we introduce (non-commutative) white noises, which are operator
algebraic versions of Tsirelson's `classical' noises. We give examples coming
from probability, quantum probability and from Voiculescu's theory of free
probability.
  Our main result is a bijective correspondence between additive and unital
shift cocycles. For the proof of the correspondence we develop tools which are

by interpolating the clock signal. Further increased resolution is obtained by

plasma sheet is investigated by means of a wavelet estimator suitable for
detecting distinct scaling characteristics even in noisy measurements. The
spectral estimators used for this purpose are affected by a frequency dependent
bias. The variances of the wavelet coefficients, however, match the power-law
shaped spectra, which makes the wavelet estimator essentially unbiased. These
scaling characteristics of the magnetic field data appear to be essentially
non-steady and intermittent. The scaling properties of bursty bulk flow (BBF)
and non-BBF associated magnetic fluctuations are analysed with the aim of
understanding processes of energy transfer between scales. Small-scale ($\sim
0.08-0.3$ s) magnetic fluctuations having the same scaling index $\alpha \sim
2.6$ as the large-scale ($\sim 0.7-5$ s) magnetic fluctuations occur during
BBF-associated periods. During non-BBF associated periods the energy transfer
to small scales is absent, and the large-scale scaling index $\alpha \sim 1.7$
is closer to Kraichnan or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scalings. The anisotropy
characteristics of magnetic fluctuations show both scale-dependent and
scale-independent behavior. The former can be partly explained in terms of the
Goldreich-Sridhar model of MHD turbulence, which leads to the picture of
Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence parallel and of eddy turbulence perpendicular to the
mean magnetic field direction. Nonetheless, other physical mechanisms, such as
transverse magnetic structures, velocity shears, or boundary effects can
contribute to the anisotropy characteristics of plasma sheet turbulence. The
scale-independent features are related to anisotropy characteristics which
occur during a period of magnetic reconnection and fast tailward flow.

for extracting certain properties of unknown quantum states without resource to

also demonstrate one-qubit quantum fingerprinting.

quantum computing. Recent experiments probing superconducting phase qubits have
revealed previously unseen fine splittings in the transition energy spectra.
These splittings have been attributed to new microscopic degrees of freedom
(microresonators), a previously unknown source of decoherence. We show that
macroscopic resonant tunneling in the extremely asymmetric double well
potential of the phase qubit can have observational consequences that are
strikingly similar to the observed data.

namely the dipole transition moment for a system with a nontrivial Morse
potential. We draw equal moment sets in the two-dimensional space of two
important parameters of the potential, namely the depth of the potential and
its width. Another variable is introduced as a scale and we see ""motions"" of
the level sets normal to the contours, as in classical contexts such as fluid
dynamics or in epitaxial crystal growth. Presumably interpolating the level
sets normally by smooth functions such as splines may give a fairly accurate
method of combining the variables to keep the dipole moment invariant.
