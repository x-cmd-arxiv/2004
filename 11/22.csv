substructure that can be used as a framework for studying galaxy formation and
an ingredient in halo models of galaxy clustering. We perform a comprehensive
comparison of the model to the results of a suite of high-resolution
cosmological simulations. The comparisons reveal that subhalo statistics, such
as velocity and mass functions, radial distributions, and the halo occupation
distributions, agree well over three orders of magnitude in host halo mass at
various redshifts. Both in the simulations and in our model, the radial
distributions of subhalos are significantly shallower than that of the dark
matter density. The abundance of subhalos in a host is set by competition
between destruction and new accretion. High mass halos and halos at high
redshift tend to host more subhalos because the subhalos have, on average, been
accreted more recently. Similarly, at fixed mass, halos that formed more
recently host more subhalos. Observed ""fossil groups"" may represent an extreme
tail of this correlation. We find a related correlation between host halo
concentration and subhalo abundance at fixed host mass, Nsat ~ c^-a, where a
changes with redshift and host-to-subhalo mass ratio. Lastly, we use our model
to populate host halos in one of our high-resolution cosmological simulations,
replacing the subhalos resolved in the simulation with subhalos computed
according to our model. We show that the resulting 2pt correlation function of
such a ""hybrid"" halo ensemble is indistinguishable from that measured directly
in the simulation. This supports one of the key tenets of the standard halo
model -- the assumption that the halo occupation distribution is statistically
independent of host halo environment.

with reliable Hipparcos parallaxes from this and from previous studies are
plotted in a logP-$M_{K}$-diagram. Our objects nicely follow the
logP-$M_{K}$-relations determined for the LMC. This allows the pulsation mode
to be identified. While all miras fall on the fundamental mode sequence, the
SRVs fall on both the first overtone and fundamental mode sequences. The SRVs
on the fundamental mode sequence occur at both high and low luminosities, some
of them being more luminous than larger amplitude miras. This demonstrates
observationally that some parameter other than luminosity affects the stability
of long period variables, probably mass. First overtone pulsators all show
velocity amplitudes around 4 km/s. For the fundamental mode pulsators, the
velocity amplitude shows a correlation with light amplitude. The two miras R
Cen and R Nor, known for their double-peaked light curves, have velocity curves
that are quite different. The R Nor velocity curve shows no evidence of the
double peaks, meaning that the true pulsation period is the time between
alternate minima or maxima. There is slight evidence for a double bump in the R
Cen velocity curve. It is suggested that these stars are relatively massive

-- FIRS 2 (hereafter FIRS 2) and the Herbig Be star LkH$\alpha$ 234 with the
aim of studying the chemical evolution of the envelopes of intermediate-mass
(IM) young stellar objects (YSOs). Both objects have similar luminosities (~500
Lsun) and are located in the same molecular cloud which minimizes the chemical
differences due to different stellar masses or initial cloud conditions.
Moreover, since they are located at the same distance, we have the same spatial
resolution in both objects. A total of 17 molecular species (including rarer
isotopes) have been observed in both objects and the structure of their
envelopes and outflows is determined with unprecedent detail.
  Our results show that the protostellar envelopes are dispersed and warmed up
during the evolution to become a pre-main sequence star. In fact, the envelope
mass decreases by a factor >5 from FIRS 2 to LkH$\alpha$234, while the kinetic
temperature increases from ~13K to 28K. On the other hand, there is no
molecular outflow associated with LkH$\alpha$234. The molecular outflow seems
to stop before the star becomes visible. These physical changes strongly affect
the chemistry of their envelopes.

ratios that can be used as chemical clocks for the envelopes of IM YSOs. The

challenges to our current understanding of fundamental physics. In principle,
to explain this phenomenon, at least two different routes may be followed:
either adjusting the energy content of the Universe -- by introducing a
negative-pressure dark energy -- or modifying gravity at very large scales --
by introducing new spatial dimensions, an idea also required by unification
theories. In the cosmological context, the role of such extra dimensions as the
source of the dark pressure responsable for the acceleration of our Universe is
translated into the so-called brane world (BW) cosmologies. Here we study
complementary constraints on a particular class of BW scenarios in which the
modification of gravity arises due to a gravitational \emph{leakage} into extra
dimensions. To this end, we use the most recent Chandra measurements of the
X-ray gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters, the WMAP determinations of the
baryon density parameter, measurements of the Hubble parameter from the
\emph{HST}, and the current supernova data. In agreement with other recent
results, it is shown that these models provide a good description for these
complementary data, although a closed scenario is always favored in the joint
analysis. We emphasize that observational tests of BW scenarios constitute a
natural verification of the role of possible extra dimensions in both
fundamental physics and cosmology.

equatorial plane of the Kerr black hole and received by an observer at
infinity. The values of these functions for different angular momenta of the

have been stored in the form of tables in a FITS file. Graphical
representations of the results are shown as an atlas of contour figures of
these functions.
  For the modelling of the spectra of an accretion disc, several general
relativistic codes have been developed. Some of them can be used inside a more
general spectral fitting package XSPEC for routine fitting of the data measured
by X-ray satellites. These are the models for the relativistic emission lines,
Compton reflection and for the general use as a relativistic extension of
existing models (convolution models). Other components of the tool have
extended features for studying non-stationary emission from accretion discs and
polarimetry.
  The newly developed codes have been employed in several applications: data
from XMM-Newton observations of Seyfert galaxy MCG-6-30-15 have been fitted,

that the same potential is used for all galaxies. Using at the same time a
quasi-isothermal dark matter density and the scalar field helps to better fit
the RC of spiral galaxies. In addition, new correlations are established.

is observed: The chromoelectric sector exhibits screening, while long-range
chromomagnetic interactions, mediated by soft modes, are still observed. At
least part of the gluon spectrum is still confined. These findings agree with

an inverse square potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^{-2}$, there exists one
stable critical point that gives an acceleration of the universe at late times.
When $\lambda \to 0$ asymptotically, we can have a viable dark energy scenario
in which the system approaches an ``instantaneous'' critical point that
dynamically changes with $\lambda$. If $|\lambda|$ approaches infinity
asymptotically, the universe does not exhibit an acceleration at late times. In

generalizations of monoidal categories with an additional functorial

`function algebra' which is a commutative cotrialgebra. Each such commutative
cotrialgebra gives rise to a symmetric Hopf category of corepresentations. In
the semisimple case, this Hopf category is a 2-vector space according to
Kapranov and Voevodsky. We also show that strict compact topological 2-groups

generalizing the Gel'fand representation, and that commutative cotrialgebras

"math/0411469","Ravi Vakil","Ravi Vakil","Murphy's Law in algebraic geometry: Badly-behaved deformation spaces",,,,,"math.AG math.CV",,"  We consider the question: ``How bad can the deformation space of an object
be?'' The answer seems to be: ``Unless there is some a priori reason otherwise,
the deformation space may be as bad as possible.'' We show this for a number of
important moduli spaces.
  More precisely, every singularity of finite type over Z (up to smooth
parameters) appears on: the Hilbert scheme of curves in projective space; and
the moduli spaces of smooth projective general-type surfaces (or
higher-dimensional varieties), plane curves with nodes and cusps, stable
sheaves, isolated threefold singularities, and more. The objects themselves are
not pathological, and are in fact as nice as can be: the curves are smooth, the
surfaces have very ample canonical bundle, the stable sheaves are torsion-free
of rank 1, the singularities are normal and Cohen-Macaulay, etc. This justifies
Mumford's philosophy that even moduli spaces of well-behaved objects should be
arbitrarily bad unless there is an a priori reason otherwise.
  Thus one can construct a smooth curve in projective space whose deformation
space has any given number of components, each with any given singularity type,
with any given non-reduced behavior along various associated subschemes.
Similarly one can give a surface over F_p that lifts to Z/p^7 but not Z/p^8.
(Of course the results hold in the holomorphic category as well.)
  It is usually difficult to compute deformation spaces directly from
obstruction theories. We circumvent this by relating them to more tractable
deformation spaces via smooth morphisms. The essential starting point is Mnev's
Universality Theorem.

Z$ and the cartesian product $G^n$ of a Garside group $G$ to study the
properties of roots and powers of elements in $G$.
  The main result is an estimate of the growth of the minimal word-length of
powers of elements in Garside groups, when the generating set is the set of
simple elements. A direct application is that the set of translation numbers in
Garside groups is discrete. It gives an affirmative answer to the question of
Gersten and Short for the case of Garside groups. The original question is for
biautomatic groups.
  And we show that the root extraction problem in a Garside group $G$ can be
reduced to a conjugacy problem in $\mathbb Z\ltimes G^n$. Using the algorithm
for the conjugacy problem in Garside groups, the root extraction problem is
decidable for any Garside group.

classical pseudodifferential operators on closed manifolds, the coefficient
$C_0(A,P)$ of $(-\lambda)^{-1}$ is of special interest, since it is the first
coefficient containing nonlocal elements from $A$; on the other hand if $A=I$
and $P=D^*D$ it gives part of the index of $D$. $C_0(A,P)$ also equals the zeta
function value at 0 when $P$ is invertible. $C_0(A,P)$ is a trace modulo local
terms, since $C_0(A,P)-C_0(A,P')$ and $C_0([A,A'],P)$ are local. By use of
complex powers $P^s$ (or similar holomorphic families of order $s$), Okikiolu,
Kontsevich and Vishik, Melrose and Nistor showed formulas for these trace
defects in terms of residues of operators defined from $A$, $A'$, $\log P$ and
$\log P'$.
  The present paper has two purposes: One is to show how the trace defect
formulas can be obtained from the resolvents in a simple way without use of the
complex powers of $P$ as in the original proofs. We here also give a simple
direct proof of a recent residue formula of Scott for $C_0(I,P)$. The other
purpose is to establish trace defect residue formulas for operators on
manifolds with boundary, where complex powers are not easily accessible; we do
this using only resolvents. We also generalize Scott's formula to boundary

we present a theoretical method and a numerical procedure which, starting from
the structure of polyelectrolytes, lead to the prediction of the cholesteric
pitch. Molecular expressions for the free energy of the system are obtained on
the basis of steric and electrostatic interactions between polymers; the former
are described in terms of excluded volume, while a mean field approximation is
used for the latter. Calculations have been performed for 130 bp fragments of
B-DNA. The theoretical predictions provide an explanation for the experimental
behavior, by showing the counteracting role played by shape and charge
chirality of the molecule.

  the BaBar Silicon Vertex Tracker","Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Nuclear Science",,,,"physics.ins-det",,"  The radiation hardness of the AToM chips of the BaBar Silicon Vertex Tracker
has been investigated by means of irradiations with photons from a 60Co source
and 0.9 GeV electrons. The increase in noise and the decrease in gain of the
amplifier have been measured as a function of the applied capacitive load and
the absorbed dose. Different beam intensities have been used to study the
effect of different dose rates to the AToM radiation damage. The chip digital
functionalities have been tested up to a dose of 5.5 Mrads for the 60Co photons
and 9 Mrads for the 0.9 GeV electrons. In addition a pedestal shift for the
irradiated channels has been observed in the test with electrons but is not
present in the irradiation with photons. This effect reproduces qualitatively
the behavior observed since 2002 in the front-end electronics of the installed
BaBar Silicon Vertex Tracker. After some investigation of the chip layout, this
peculiar behavior could be associated to radiation damage in a well-identified
component of the AToM. The results of the radiation tests are presented and
used to extrapolate the performance and lifetime of the installed detector in
the next few years.

conditions may be characterized in terms of predictability of time series
signals from the underlying biological system. In particular we consider
systolic arterial pressure time series from healthy subjects and Chronic Heart
Failure patients, undergoing paced respiration. We model time series by the
regularized least squares approach and quantify predictability by the
leave-one-out error. We find that the entrainment mechanism connected to paced
breath, that renders the arterial blood pressure signal more regular, thus more
predictable, is less effective in patients, and this effect correlates with the
seriousness of the heart failure. The leave-one-out error separates controls
from patients and, when all orders of nonlinearity are taken into account,
alive patients from patients for which cardiac death occurred.

gives more plausible results. We also calculate the dipole moment for the

is a critical depth of the potential. Finally we find the level sets giving
equal expectation values of the energy, and comment on the unitary operators
needed to make transitions from any level set to another.

Rev. E 71, 016209 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevE.71.016209",,"quant-ph",,"  We show, via numerical simulations, that the fidelity decay behavior of
quasi-integrable systems is strongly dependent on the location of the initial
coherent state with respect to the underlying classical phase space. In
parallel to classical fidelity, the quantum fidelity generally exhibits
Gaussian decay when the perturbation affects the frequency of periodic phase
space orbits and power-law decay when the perturbation changes the shape of the
orbits. For both behaviors the decay rate also depends on initial state
location. The spectrum of the initial states in the eigenbasis of the system
reflects the different fidelity decay behaviors. In addition, states with
initial Gaussian decay exhibit a stage of exponential decay for strong
perturbations. This elicits a surprising phenomenon: a strong perturbation can
induce a higher fidelity than a weak perturbation of the same type.

shifting the ""quantum weight"" from the electromagnetic field to the

two-photon interference in atomic Rubidium, to obtain focal spots that beat the
