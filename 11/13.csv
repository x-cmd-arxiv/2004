gravitational lensing effects in the strong gravitational field of the Kerr
black hole. These techniques are applied to explore both the imaging and
spectral properties of photons that perform multiple orbits of the central mass
before escaping to infinity. Viewed at large inclinations, these higher order
photons contribute $\sim 20 %$ of the total luminosity of the system for a
Schwarzschild hole, whilst for an extreme Kerr black hole this fraction rises
to $\sim 60 %$. In more realistic models these photons will be re-absorbed by
the disc at large distances from the hole, but this returning radiation could
provide a physical mechanism to resolve the discrepancy between the predicted
and observed optical/UV colours in AGN. Conversely, at low inclinations, higher
order images re-intercept the disc plane close to the black hole, so need not
be absorbed by the disc if this is within the plunging region. These photons
form a bright ring carrying approximately 10% of the total disc luminosity for
a Schwarzchild black hole. The spatial separation between the inner edge of the
disc and the ring is similar to the size of the event horizon. This is
resolvable for supermassive black holes with proposed X-ray interferometery
missions such as MAXIM, so has the potential to provide an observational test
of strong field gravity.

the galaxy power spectrum which are clearly seen imprinted on the Cosmic
Microwave Background. It has recently been proposed that these oscillations
allow a `standard ruler' method of probing the equation of state of dark
energy. In this paper we present a new calculation of the number of galaxies
future adio telescopes will detect in surveys of the sky in neutral Hydrogen
(HI). We estimate the likely statistical errors if the standard ruler method
were to be applied to such surveys. We emphasise uncertainties in our
calculations, and pinpoint the most important features of future HI surveys if
they are to provide new constraints on dark energy via baryonic oscillations.
Designs of future radio telescopes are required to have a large bandwidth
(characterised by \beta$, the ratio of the instantaneous bandwidth to the
bandwidth required by survey) and to have the widest instantaneous (1.4 GHz)
field of view ($FOV$) possible. Given the expected sensitivity of a future
Square Kilometre Array (SKA), given that half of its collecting area will be
concentrated in a core of diameter $\sim 5 ~ \rm km$, and given a reasonable
survey duration ($T_0$ $\sim$ 1 yr), we show that there will be negligible shot
noise on a power spectrum derived from HI galaxies out to redshift $z \simeq
1.5$. To access the largest cosmic volume possible by surveying all the sky
available, we argue that $\beta$, $T_0$ and $FOV$ must obey the relation $\beta
FOV T_0 \gtsimeq 10 \rm deg^2$ yr. An $\sim$1-yr SKA survey would then contain
$\gtsimeq 10^{9} (f_{\rm sky}/0.5)$ HI galaxies and provide constraints on the
dark-energy parameter $w$ of order $\Delta w \simeq 0.01 (f_{\rm

selected in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band (1750-2750 A, lambda_m = 2310 A)
and in the far-infrared (FIR) at 60micron. These samples are built using the
GALEX and IRAS sky surveys over ~600 square degrees. The NUV selected sample
contains 95 galaxies detected down to NUV=16mag (AB system). 83 galaxies in
this sample are spirals or irregulars and only two of them are not detected at
60micron. The FIR selected sample is built from the IRAS PSCz catalog complete
down to 0.6Jy. Among the 163 sources, we select 118 star forming galaxies well
measured by IRAS, all but 1 are detected in NUV and 14 galaxies are not
detected in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) band (1350-1750 A, lambda_m = 1530 A).
The dust to ultraviolet (NUV and FUV) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate the
dust attenuation at both wavelengths. The median value of the attenuation in
NUV is found to be ~1 mag for the NUV selected sample versus ~2 mag for the FIR
selected one. Within both samples, the dust attenuation is found to correlate
with the luminosity of the galaxies. Almost all the NUV selected galaxies and
2/3 of the FIR selected sample exhibit a lower dust attenuation than that
expected from the tight relation found previously for starburst galaxies
between the dust attenuation and the slope of the ultraviolet continuum. The
situation is inverse for one third of the FIR selected galaxies: their
extinction is higher than that deduced from their FUV-NUV color and the

at z=2 satisfy the color-selection criteria proposed by Adelberger et al.
(2004) and Steidel et al. (2004) when we assume Calzetti extinction with
E(B-V)=0.15. We find that the number density of simulated galaxies brighter
than R<25.5 at z=2 is about 1e-2 h^3 Mpc^-3 for E(B-V)=0.15, which is roughly
twice that of the number density found by Erb et al. (2004) for the UV bright
sample. This suggests that roughly half of the massive galaxies with M*>10^{10}
Msun/h at z=2 are UV bright population, and the other half is bright in the
infra-red wavelengths. The most massive galaxies at z=2 have stellar masses >=
10^{11-12} Msun. They typically have been continuously forming stars with a
rate exceeding 30 Msun/yr over a few Gyrs from z=10 to z=2, together with
significant contribution by starbursts reaching up to 1000 Msun/yr which lie on
top of the continuous component. TVD simulations indicate a more sporadic star
formation history than the SPH simulations. Our results do not imply that
hierarchical galaxy formation fails to account for the observed massive
galaxies at z>=1. The global star formation rate density in our simulations
peaks at z>=5, a much higher redshift than predicted by the semianalytic
models. This star formation history suggests early build-up of the stellar mass
density, and predicts that 70 (50, 30)% of the total stellar mass at z=0 had
already been formed by z=1 (2, 3). Upcoming observations by Spitzer and Swift
might help to better constrain the star formation history at high redshift.

  Journal, Feb 2005 issue",,"10.1086/427393",,"astro-ph",,"  In our second paper on long-term quasar variability, we employ a much larger
database of quasars than in de Vries, Becker & White. This expanded sample,
containing 35165 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2, and
6413 additional quasars in the same area of the sky taken from the 2dF QSO
Redshift Survey, allows us to significantly improve on our earlier conclusions.
As before, all the historic quasar photometry has been calibrated onto the SDSS
scale by using large numbers of calibration stars around each quasar position.
We find the following: (1) the outbursts have an asymmetric light-curve
profile, with a fast-rise, slow-decline shape; this argues against a scenario
in which micro-lensing events along the line-of-sight to the quasars are
dominating the long-term variations in quasars; (2) there is no turnover in the
Structure Function of the quasars up to time-scales of ~40 years, and the
increase in variability with increasing time-lags is monotonic and constant;
and consequently, (3) there is not a single preferred characteristic outburst
time-scale for the quasars, but most likely a continuum of outburst
time-scales, (4) the magnitude of the quasar variability is a function of
wavelength: variability increases toward the blue part of the spectrum, (5)
high-luminosity quasars vary less than low-luminosity quasars, consistent with
a scenario in which variations have limited absolute magnitude. Based on this,
we conclude that quasar variability is intrinsic to the Active Galactic
Nucleus, is caused by chromatic outbursts / flares with a limited luminosity
range and varying time-scales, and which have an overall asymmetric light-curve
shape. Currently the model that has the most promise of fitting the
observations is based on accretion disk instabilities.

account the effects of local large scale structure. The global HIMF derived for
this optically-selected sample is well fit by a Schechter function with alpha =
-1.24, log(M* / M_Sun)=9.99, phi* = 3.2 (10^{-3}) Mpc^{-3}. These values match
those derived from blind HI surveys to within the estimated uncertainties, yet
our estimated HIMF is clearly lower than most other estimates at the lowest
masses. We also investigate the variation in the derived HIMF among spiral
subclasses, finding a clear distinction between the Schechter parameters found
for types Sa-Sc and those Scd and later, in the sense that the HIMF of the
latest types is rising at the low mass end, whereas that of the main spiral
classes is flat or even declining. We also explore the possible environmental
dependence of the HIMF by computing it separately in regimes of differing
cosmic density. The HIMFs of higher density regions are found to have flatter
low-mass ends and lower values of M* than those of lower density regions,
although the statistical significance of the difference is low. We find that
the environmental dependence cannot be accounted for by morphological
segregation, and must be a consequence of differences among galaxies of the
same morphological type but found in different environments. If this dependence
is caused by the well known deficiency of galaxies in clusters, then it would
suggest that galaxies of small linear optical diameter are characterized by
higher HI deficiency, an expectation consistent with gas removal mechanisms
such as ram pressure stripping.

width of the annihilation line is 2.37$\pm$0.25 keV (FWHM), while the strength
of the ortho-positronium continuum suggests that the dominant fraction of
positrons (94$\pm$6%) form positronium before annihilation. Compared to the
previous missions these deep INTEGRAL observations provide the most stringent
constraints on the line energy and width.
  Under the assumption of an annihilation in a single-phase medium these
spectral parameters can be explained by a warm $T_e\sim 7000-4~10^4$ K gas with
the degree of ionization larger than a few $10^{-2}$. One of the wide-spread
ISM phases - warm ($T_e \sim 8000$ K) and weakly ionized (degree of ionization
$\sim$ 0.1) medium satisfies these criteria. Other single-phase solutions are
also formally allowed by the data (e.g. cold, but substantially ionized ISM),
but such solutions are believed to be astrophysically unimportant.
  The observed spectrum can also be explained by the annihilation in a
multi-phase ISM. The fraction of positrons annihilating in a very hot ($T_e \ge
10^6$ K) phase is constrained to be less than $\sim$8%. Neither a moderately
hot ($T_e \ge 10^5$ K) ionized medium nor a very cold ($T_e \le 10^3$ K)

spectrum. However, a combination of cold/neutral, warm/neutral and warm/ionized
phases in comparable proportions could also be consistent with the data.

comparing each observed broad-band SED (two GALEX and five SDSS bands) with an
extensive library of model galaxy SEDs, which cover a wide range of star
formation histories and include stochastic starbursts. We compare the
constraints derived using SDSS bands only with those derived using the
combination of SDSS and GALEX photometry. We find that the addition of the
GALEX bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dust
optical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 Myr to 1 Gyr
in a galaxy. We are sensitive to SFRs as low as 10^{-3} M_sun/yr, and we find
that low levels of star formation (SF) are mostly associated with early-type,
red galaxies. The least massive galaxies have ratios of current to
past-averaged SF rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant SF over a Hubble
time. For late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. We
find that b correlates tightly with NUV-r color, implying that the SF history
of a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the NUV-r color alone. The
fraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode within
the last 1 Gyr steeply declines with mass-from ~20% for galaxies with ~10^8

Spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirms

to the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances to
SNe Ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the same

energy under the assumption that the sources concerned are in the stage of
fireballs. Due to the Doppler effect of fireballs, there exists a power law
relationship between the two quantities within a limited range of frequency.
The power law range and the power law index depend strongly on the observed
peak energy $E_p$ as well as the rest frame radiation form, and the upper and
lower limits of the power law range can be determined by $E_p$. It is found
that, within the same power law range, the ratio of the $FWHM$ of the rising
portion to that of the decaying phase of the pulses is also related with energy
in the form of power laws. A platform-power-law-platform feature could be
observed in the two relationships. In the case of an obvious softening of the
rest frame spectrum, the two power law relationships also exist, but the
feature would evolve to a peaked one. Predictions on the relationships in the
energy range covering both the BATSE and Swift bands for a typical hard burst
and a typical soft one are made. A sample of FRED (fast rise and exponential
decay) pulse bursts shows that 27 out of the 28 sources belong to either the
platform-power-law-platform feature class or the peaked feature group,
suggesting that the effect concerned is indeed important for most of the
sources of the sample. Among these bursts, many might undergo an obvious
softening evolution of the rest frame spectrum.

spectroscopy to obtain a complete inventory of solid state material present
along the line of sight toward the source. We model the object with a 2D
axisymmetric (effectively 3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. It is found
that the model disk, assuming a standard flaring structure, is too warm to
contain the very large observed column density of pure CO ice, but is possibly
responsible for up to 50% of the water, CO2 and minor ice species. In
particular the 6.85 micron band, tentatively due to NH4+, exhibits a prominent
red wing, indicating a significant contribution from warm ice in the disk. It
is argued that the pure CO ice is located in the dense core Oph-F in front of
the source seen in the submillimeter imaging, with the CO gas in the core
highly depleted. The model is used to predict which circumstances are most
favourable for direct observations of ices in edge-on circumstellar disks. Ice
bands will in general be deepest for inclinations similar to the disk opening
angle, i.e. ~70 degrees. Due to the high optical depths of typical disk
mid-planes, ice absorption bands will often probe warmer ice located in the
upper layers of nearly edge-on disks. The ratios between different ice bands
are found to vary by up to an order of magnitude depending on disk inclination
due to radiative transfer effects caused by the 2D structure of the disk.
Ratios between ice bands of the same species can therefore be used to constrain
the location of the ices in a circumstellar disk. [Abstract abridged]

reveal several generic dynamical regimes, depending on the amplitude and

in motion. These regimes include irregular motion, regular motion of a decaying
soliton, and regular motion of a stable one. The motion may occur in both the
straight and reverse directions, relative to the initial thrust. In the case of
stable motion, extremely long simulations in a lattice with periodic boundary
conditions demonstrate that the soliton keeps moving as long as we can monitor
without any visible loss. Velocities of moving stable solitons are in good
agreement with the analytical prediction, which is based on requiring a
resonance between the ac drive and motion of the soliton through the periodic

consider constructions which are known to the effective field-theorist as

particular, if the discrete symmetry used to break the GUT group acts freely, a
non-local breaking in the larger compact dimensions can be realized, leading to
a precise gauge coupling unification as expected on the basis of the MSSM

integral involving the Berezin kernel $B_{\nu}$, an invariant kernel on the
Riemannian symmetric space $G/K$, which is a Makarevich symmetric space in the

the spherical Fourier transform of $B_{\nu}$. From these, one deduces that the
Berezin kernel satisfies a remarkable Bernstein identity : $$D(\nu)B_{\nu}
=b(\nu)B_{\nu +1},$$ where $D(\nu)$ is an invariant differential operator on
$G/K$ and $b(\nu)$ is a polynomial. By using this identity we compute a Hua

  Nice (France)",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  In this report, we describe characteristics of a ring-structure hydrogen
plasma heated in electron cyclotron resonance conditions and confined in a
mirror magnetic trap and discuss the relative efficiency of secondary electrons
and thermoelectrons in negative hydrogen and deuterium ion production. The
obtained data and calculations of the balance equations for possible reactions
demonstrate that the negative ion production is realized in two stages. First,
the hydrogen and deuterium molecules are excited in collisions with the plasma
electrons to high-laying Rydberg or vibrational levels in the plasma volume.
The second stage leads to the negative ion production through the process of
dissociative attachment of low energy electrons. The low energy electrons are
originated due to a bombardment of the plasma electrode by ions of one of the
driven rings and thermoemission from heated tungsten filaments. Experiments
seem to indicate that the negative ion generation occurs predominantly in the
limited volume filled with thermoelectrons. Estimation of the negative ion
generation rate shows that the main channel of and ion production involves the
process of high Rydberg state excitation.

  I232-I240, 2004",,,"q-bio.QM",,"  We present a novel classification-based method for learning to predict gene
regulatory response. Our approach is motivated by the hypothesis that in simple
organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for
predicting whether a gene is up- or down-regulated in a particular experiment
based on (1) the presence of binding site subsequences (``motifs'') in the
gene's regulatory region and (2) the expression levels of regulators such as
transcription factors in the experiment (``parents''). Thus our learning task
integrates two qualitatively different data sources: genome-wide cDNA
microarray data across multiple perturbation and mutant experiments along with
motif profile data from regulatory sequences. We convert the regression task of
predicting real-valued gene expression measurement to a classification task of
predicting +1 and -1 labels, corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond
the levels of biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. The
learning algorithm employed is boosting with a margin-based generalization of
decision trees, alternating decision trees. This large-margin classifier is
sufficiently flexible to allow complex logical functions, yet sufficiently
simple to give insight into the combinatorial mechanisms of gene regulation. We
observe encouraging prediction accuracy on experiments based on the Gasch S.
cerevisiae dataset, and we show that we can accurately predict up- and
down-regulation on held-out experiments. Our method thus provides predictive
hypotheses, suggests biological experiments, and provides interpretable insight
into the structure of genetic regulatory networks.

This repertoire is controlled by the 300 neurons projecting from brain into
spinal cord. Understanding how descending control signals shape the output of
spinal circuits, however, is nontrivial. We have therefore developed a
segmental oscillator model (using NEURON) to investigate this system. We found
that adjusting the strength of NMDA and glycinergic synapses enabled the
generation of oscillation (tail-beat) frequencies over the range exhibited in
different larval swim patterns. In addition, we developed a kinematic model to
visualize the more complex axial bending patterns used during prey capture.

addressed. Specifically, it is shown that the maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) approach, already known to apply to quantum state tomography, is also
applicable to quantum process tomography (estimating the Kraus operator sum
representation (OSR)), Hamiltonian parameter estimation, and the related
problems of state and process (OSR) distribution estimation. Except for
Hamiltonian parameter estimation, the other MLE problems are formally of the
same type of convex optimization problem and therefore can be solved very
efficiently to within any desired accuracy.
  Associated with each of these estimation problems, and the focus of the
paper, is an optimal experiment design (OED) problem invoked by the Cramer-Rao
Inequality: find the number of experiments to be performed in a particular
system configuration to maximize estimation accuracy; a configuration being any
number of combinations of sample times, hardware settings, prepared initial
states, etc. We show that in all of the estimation problems, including
Hamiltonian parameter estimation, the optimal experiment design can be obtained
by solving a convex optimization problem.
  Software to solve the MLE and OED convex optimization problems is available
upon request from the first author.
