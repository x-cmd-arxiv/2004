to the coupling term ${\bbox \omega}\cdot {\bf p}$, being ${\bf p}$ the

the neutrino emission asymmetry generated by the relative orientation of ${\bf

from the aspect of spectral change. Hard X-ray emission from the point source
of Eta Carinae was detected even during the minimum. During the minimum the
observed flux above 3 keV was ~3e-12 ergs cm-2 s-1, which is about one percent
of the flux before the minimum. Changes in the spectral shape revealed two
X-ray emission components in the central point source. One component is
non-variable and has relatively cool plasma of kT~1 keV and moderate
absorption, NH~5e22 cm-2. The plasma is probably located far from the star,
possibly produced by the high speed polar wind from Eta Carinae. The other high
temperature component has kT~5 keV and is strongly variable. This component
shows an increase in the apparent column density from 5e22 cm-2 to 2e23 cm-2,
probably originating near the heart of the binary system. These changes in NH
were smaller than expected if the minimum is produced solely by an increase of
hydrogen column density. The X-ray minimum seems to be dominated by a decrease
of the apparent emission measure, suggesting that the brightest part of the
X-ray emitting region is completely obscured during the minimum in the form of
an eclipse. A ``partial covering'' model might explain the residual emission
seen during the minimum.

results: high spatial resolution images of PAH emission and the adjacent
continuum emission from the central regions of the nearby starburst galaxies
NGC253 and NGC1808. Globally, the PAH emission is seen to peak on the central
starburst regions of both sources. On smaller scales, however, we see no
general spatial correlation or anti-correlation between the PAH emission and
the location of sites of recent star formation, suggesting that the degree to
which PAH emission traces starburst activity is more complicated than
previously hypothesized based on results from data with lower spatial
resolution. We do find spatial correlations, though, when we consider the
PAH-to-continuum ratio, which is low at the positions of known super star
clusters in NGC1808 as well as at the position of the IR peak in NGC253. We
take this to imply a decrease in the efficiency of PAH emission induced by the
star formation, caused by mechanical energy input into the ISM or
photoionisation or photodissociation of the PAH molecules. All three hypotheses
are discussed. In addition, for the first time we present observations of PAH
emission in the superwind of a starbursting system (NGC253), providing strong
support that winds are heavily mass-loaded and entrain substantial amounts of
ambient ISM. We have also found a plausible connection between observed NaD

important implications for enriching galaxy halos and possibly the

resolve the X-ray emission into a bright central source (L(X)~10^41 erg/s),
plus two (L(X)>10^40 erg/s) ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) located either
end of the bar. The soft emission of the central source is well-modelled by a
two-temperature thermal plasma with kT=0.4/0.7 keV. The hard emission is
modelled with a flat absorbed power-law (Gamma~1.7, NH~10^22 cm^2), and this
together with a low-significance (1.7 sigma) ~300 eV equivalent width emission
line at ~6 keV are the first indications that NGC7771 may host a low-luminosity
AGN. For the bar ULXs, a power-law fit to X-1 is improved at the 2.5 sigma
level with the addition of a thermal plasma component (kT~0.3 keV), while X-2
is improved only at the 1.3 sigma level with the addition of a disc blackbody
component with T(in)~0.2 keV. Both sources are variable on short time-scales
implying that their emission is dominated by single accreting X-ray binaries
(XRBs). The three remaining galaxies, NGC7770, NGC2342 and NGC2341, have
observed X-ray luminosities of 0.2, 1.8 & 0.9x10^41 erg/s respectively (0.3-10

thermal plasma components with kT=0.2-0.7 keV, plus power-law continua with
slopes of Gamma=1.8-2.3 that are likely to represent the integrated emission of
populations of XRBs as observed in other nearby merger systems. A comparison
with other isolated, interacting and merging systems shows that all four
galaxies follow the established correlations for starburst galaxies between
X-ray, far-infrared and radio luminosities, demonstrating that their X-ray
outputs are dominated by their starburst components.

  Kluwer Academic Publishers, edited by Jose Carlos del Toro Iniesta, et al",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Star complexes are the largest globular regions of star formation in
galaxies. If there is a spiral density wave, nuclear ring, tidal arm, or other
well-defined stellar structure, then gravitational instabilities in the gaseous
component produce giant cloud complexes with a spacing of about three times the
width. These gas complexes form star complexes, giving the familiar beads on a
string of star formation along spiral arms, or nuclear hotspots in the case of
a ring. Turbulence compression, supernovae, and self-gravitational contraction
inside the giant clouds produce a nearly scale-free structure, including giant
molecular clouds that form OB associations and molecular cloud cores that form
clusters. Without stellar density waves or similar structures, random
gravitational instabilities form flocculent spirals and these fragment into
star complexes, OB associations and star clusters in the same way. The largest
coherent star-forming regions are the flocculent arms themselves. At the core
of the hierarchy are the very dense clumps in which individual and binary stars
form. The overall star formation rate in a galaxy appears to be regulated by
gravitational collapse on large scales, giving the Kennicutt/Schmidt law
scaling with density, but the efficiency factor in front of this scaling law
depends on the fraction of the gas that is in a dense form. Turbulence
compression probably contributes to this fraction. The CO version of the
Schmidt law, recently derived by Heyer et al. (2004), follows from the
turbulent hierarchy as well, as do the local efficiencies of star formation in
OB associations and clusters. The efficiency of star formation increases with
cloud density, and this is why most stars form in clusters that are initially
self-bound.

gas gravitationally focused into a Bondi-Hoyle wake, a thermal mixture of ~64%
Pavo IGM gas with ~36% galaxy gas that has been removed from the spiral NGC6872
by turbulent viscous stripping, or both, due to the spiral's supersonic motion
at angle xi ~ 40 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky, past the Pavo

tools to characterise the Line Emission Region (LER) of the program lines,
including turbulence and line-optical depth effects. We find that
monitored-lines can be fitted well with a pure optically thin formation
mechanism, line-broadening resulting from the finite velocity extent of the LER
rather than turbulence.Our new estimates of LER velocity centroids are
systematically shifted outwards closer to terminal velocity compared to
previous determinations, now suggesting WR-wind acceleration length scales of
ca. 10-20Rsun, a factor of a few smaller than previously inferred. Based on
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the line-driven-instability mechanism,
we compute synthetic line profile variability for CIII5696A, for WR111 The
results match well the measured observed migration of 20-30 m/s2, However, our
model stellar radius of 19 Rsun, typical of an O-type supergiant, is a factor
2--10 larger than generally expected for WR core radii.Such small radii leave
inferred acceleration scales to be more extended than expected from dynamical
models of line driving, but the severity of the discrepancy is substantially
reduced compared to previous analyses. We conclude with a discussion of how
using lines formed deeper in the wind would provide a stronger constraint on
the key wind dynamics as well as information on the onset of wind clumping.

of the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) is simply caused by geometrical effects and
the insufficient treatment of the radiative transfer. Standard photoionization
models are applicable only to homogeneous and spherical symmetric nebulae with
central ionizing stars, whereas the geometry of disk galaxies requires a 3D
distribution of ionizing sources in the disk which illuminate the halo. This
change in geometry together with a proper radiative transfer model is expected
to substantially influence ionization conditions. Therefore, we developed a new
and sophisticated 3D Monte Carlo photoionization code, called SOAP (Simulations
Of Astrophysical Plasmas), by adapting an existing 1D code for HII-regions
(Och, Lucy, & Rosa 1998) such, that it self-consistently models a 3D disk

with exponentially decreasing gas densities are presented and the predicted
ionization structure of disk and halo is discussed. Theoretical line ratios
agree well with observed ones, e.g,. for the halo of NGC891. Moreover, the
fraction of ionizing photons leaving the halo of the galaxy is plotted as a
function of varying gas densities. This quantity will be of particular
importance for forthcoming studies, because rough estimates indicate that about
7% ionizing photons escape from the halo and contribute to the ionization of
the IGM. Given the relatively large number density of normal spiral galaxies,
OB-stars could have a much stronger impact on the ionization of the IGM than

in the velocity space that kinematically younger and older contact binaries
exist in the sample. Kinematically young (0.5 Gyr) sub-sample (MG) is formed by
selecting the systems which are satisfying the kinematical criteria of moving
groups. After removing the possible MG members and the systems which are known
to be members of open clusters, the rest of the sample is called Field Contact
Binaries (FCB). The FCB has further divided into four groups according to The
orbital period ranges. Then a correlation has been found in the sense that
shorter period less massive systems have larger velocity dispersions than the
longer period more massive systems. Dispersions in the velocity space indicates
5.47 Gyr kinematical age for the FCB group. Comparing with the field
chromospherically active binaries (CAB), presumably detached binary progenitors
of the contact systems, the FCB appears to be 1.61 Gyr older. Assuming an
equilibrium in the formation and destruction of CAB and W UMa systems in the
Galaxy, this age difference is treated as empirically deduced lifetime of the
contact stage. Since the kinematical ages of the four sub groups of FCB are
much longer than the 1.61 Gyr lifetime of the contact stage, the pre-contact
stages of FCB must dominantly be producing the large dispersions. The
kinematically young (0.5 Gyr) MG group covers the same total mass, period and
spectral ranges as the FCB. But, the very young age of this group does not
leave enough room for pre-contact stages, thus it is most likely that those
systems were formed in the beginning of the main-sequence or during the
pre-main-sequence contraction phase.

quasi-classical theoretical viewpoint about the nature of gravitation in galaxy
discs provides extremely high concordance (comparable with MOND) with the
observed dynamics in optical discs.
  In this paper, we consider the possibility that the optical disc and the flat
radio disc represent distinct dynamical regions which are inherently described
by distinct phases of the same over-arching theory of which the quasi-classical
theory is but one phase. This is a defining moment for the theory under
discussion since the only natural generalization available is that from the
existing quasi-classical (one-clock) model into a quasi-relativistic
(two-clock) model. The quasi-relativistic disc turns out to be a stationary
hyperbolic disc within which information propagates along characteristics and
within which the rotation curve is necessarily exactly flat.
  The transition between the two components of the disc is managed by
physically determined jump conditions which are represented by a set of
non-linear algebraic equations. These equations predict the existence of a
forbidden region within the parameter space which coincides exactly with that
part of the parameter space in which there is an already observed highly
significant underpopulation of galaxy discs (astro-ph/0107300).

in liquid water, namely, expansion upon cooling and an increase of diffusivity
upon compression. In particular, we calculate the phase diagram from the
simulation and successfully compare it with the phase diagram obtained using
the Rogers-Young (RY) closure for the Ornstein-Zernike equation. Both the
theoretical and the numerical calculations confirm the presence of a line of
isobaric density maxima, and lines of compressibility minima and maxima.
Indirect evidence of a liquid-liquid critical point is found. Dynamic
properties also show anomalies. Along constant temperature paths, as the
density increases, the dynamics alternates several times between slowing down
and speeding up, and we associate this behavior with the progressive
structuring and de-structuring of the liquid. Finally we confirm that mode
coupling theory successfully predicts the non-monotonic behavior of dynamics
and the presence of multiple glass phases, providing strong evidence that
structure (the only input of mode coupling theory) controls dynamics.

the phase diagram for arbitrary vortex filling factor. Using this method, we
discuss several filling factors explicitly. For increasing strength of the
optical lattice, the system exhibits a transition from the unpinned hexagonal
lattice to a lattice structure where all the vortices are pinned by the optical
lattice. The geometry of this fully pinned vortex lattice depends on the
filling factor and is either square or triangular. For some filling factors
there is an intermediate half-pinned phase where only half of the vortices is
pinned. We also consider the case of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate,
where the possible coexistence of the above-mentioned phases further enriches
the phase diagram. In addition, we calculate the dispersion of the low-lying
collective modes of the vortex lattice and find that, depending on the
structure of the ground state, they can be gapped or gapless. Moreover, in the
half-pinned and fully pinned phases, the collective mode dispersion is
anisotropic. Possible experiments to probe the collective mode spectrum, and in

been conjectured to be the phase space variables of the classical integrable

under study these integrable systems are degenerations of the classical,

provide multiple coordinate patches on the gauge theory moduli space. By
studying the vacua of the superpotentials in several examples we find that the

are afforded by noninteracting quasiparticles in disordered metals and
superconductors, and by relativistic fermions in random gauge field
backgrounds.
  The primary data of the classification are a Nambu space of fermionic field
operators which carry a representation of some symmetry group. Our approach is
to eliminate all of the unitary symmetries from the picture by transferring to
an irreducible block of equivariant homomorphisms. After reduction, the block
data specifying a linear space of symmetry-compatible Hamiltonians consist of a
basic vector space V, a space of endomorphisms in End(V+V*), a bilinear form on
V+V* which is either symmetric or alternating, and one or two antiunitary
symmetries that may mix V with V*. Every such set of block data is shown to
determine an irreducible classical compact symmetric space. Conversely, every
irreducible classical compact symmetric space occurs in this way.

conjectured some time ago.

the number of stable sets of cardinality $k$ in the graph $G$, then it is
called the independence polynomial of $G$ (Gutman and Harary, 1983). Alavi,
Malde, Schwenk and Erdos (1987) conjectured that $I(G;x)$ is unimodal, whenever
$G$ is a forest, while Brown, Dilcher and Nowakowski (2000) conjectured that
$I(G;x)$ is unimodal for any well-covered graph G. Michael and Traves (2003)
showed that the assertion is false for well-covered graphs with $a(G)$ > 3
($a(G)$ is the size of a maximum stable set of the graph $G$), while for very
well-covered graphs the conjecture is still open. In this paper we give support
to both conjectures by demonstrating that if $a(G)$ < 4, or $G$ belongs to
${K_{1,n}, P_{n}: n > 0}$, then $I(G*;x)$ is log-concave, and, hence, unimodal
(where $G*$ is the very well-covered graph obtained from $G$ by appending a
single pendant edge to each vertex).

nonlinearity and systematically study its dependence on the system's

film's geometry while a dimensionless group ${\cal P}$, similar to the Prandtl

to search for a small parity-violating directional asymmetry in the angular
distribution of 2.2 MeV gamma-rays from the capture of polarized cold neutrons
by protons with a sensitivity of several ppb. The weak pion-nucleon coupling
constant can be determined from this asymmetry. The small size of the asymmetry
requires a high cold neutron flux, control of systematic errors at the ppb
level, and the use of current mode gamma-ray detection with vacuum photo diodes
and low-noise solid-state preamplifiers. The average detector photoelectron
yield was determined to be 1300 photoelectrons per MeV. The RMS width seen in
the measurement is therefore dominated by the fluctuations in the number of
gamma rays absorbed in the detector (counting statistics) rather than the
intrinsic detector noise. The detectors were tested for noise performance,
sensitivity to magnetic fields, pedestal stability and cosmic background. False
asymmetries due to gain changes and electronic pickup in the detector system
were measured to be consistent with zero to an accuracy of $10^{-9}$ in a few
hours. We report on the design, operating criteria, and the results of

analysed. The dust macroparticles are negatively charged, but are unmagnetized
because of their high mass. The electrons are highly magnetized, and the ions
have intermediate magnetization. This results in different transport rates of
the different species across the magnetic field. Depending on the size of the
magnetic field, and the relative charge on the different species, the dust
grains can be the dominant current carrier. The space charge clouds near the
electrodes will then be determined by the relative mobility of the different
species. The discharge can operate in one of two modes, a positive space charge
(PSC) mode, characterized by a strong cathode fall, and a negative space charge
(NSC) mode, characterized by a broad anode fall. Features unique to the dust
particles can also play a role in the structure of the discharge, such as the
variable equilibrium charge on the grains, dependent on the local potential and
species temperatures, the effect of gravity on the grain dynamics, and the rate
of charging of the grains. The dust grains can also form an ordered structure,
the dust-plasma crystal. A fluid model of the different species is used to
calculate the structure of the resulting discharge, incorporating the above
effects. The transition from the PSC mode to the NSC mode as the magnetic
