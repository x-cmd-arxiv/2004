This paper presents the final, 100% identified, catalog together with the
optical, X-ray and broad-band SEDs constructed combining literature
multi-frequency data with non-simultaneous optical observations and BeppoSAX
X-ray data, when available. The SEDs confirm that the peak of the synchrotron

X-ray observations show that, in most cases, the X-ray spectra are convex and
well described by a logarithmic parabola model peaking (in a E f(E) vs E

energies involved most of the sources in the catalog are likely to be TeV
emitters, with the closest and brightest ones probably detectable by the
present generation of Cherenkov telescopes. The optical spectrum of about one
fourth of the sources is totally featureless. Because this implies that the

gradients inside the half-light radius of the compact Local Group elliptical
galaxy M32. All but a few (of 24 measured) indices show a statistically
significant gradient. Comparing with models, the index gradients indicate a
mean age and abundance gradient in the sense that the nucleus is a factor of
2.5 younger and a factor of 0.3 dex more metal-rich than at 1 effective radius.
This conclusion is only weakly dependent on which index combinations are used
and is robust to high accuracy. Stars near the M32 nucleus have a mean age and
heavy element abundance [M/H] of (4.7 Gyr, +0.02), judging from models by
Worthey with variable abundance ratios. This result has very small formal
random errors, although, of course, there is significant age-metallicity
degeneracy along an (age, abundance) line segment from (5.0 Gyr, 0.00) to (4.5
Gyr, +0.05). An abundance pattern of [C/M]=+0.077, [N/M]=-0.13, [Mg/M]=-0.18,

fitting precision of about 0.01 dex. Model uncertainties make the accuracies of
these values at least twice the magnitude of the precision. Forcing
scaled-solar abundances does not change the age very much, but it increases the
rms goodness of model-data fit by a factor of 3 and broadens the allowed range
of age to $\pm 1$ Gyr. The overall abundance pattern contrasts with larger

the cosmic density perturbation and structure formation theory and the fact

that the halo formation, gas distribution, and star formation around QSOs are
biased from those of the cosmic average. We argue that a significant fraction
of hydrogen in the Str\""omgren sphere around QSOs is ionized by photons from
stars and that only about several percent to at most 10%--20% of the total
hydrogen is left (e.g., in minihalos, halos, or high-density subregions) to be
ionized by QSO photons. The cosmic average neutral hydrogen fraction at
z~6.2-6.4 should also be smaller than the upper limit of 10%--20% and may be
only a few percent. We analyze the clumping property of the hydrogen ionized by
QSOs and study the evolution of the Str\""omgren sphere. We find that the
expected Str\""omgren radii from our models are consistent with observations if
the lifetime of the highest redshift QSOs is about or longer than a few times
10^7 yr (as is the lifetime of the main population of QSOs; with comoving
number density peaked at z~2-3). With such a QSO lifetime, the ages of most of
the observed QSOs are long enough that the QSO photon emission is balanced by
the recombination of the hydrogen ionized by QSO photons in their Str\""omgren

black hole accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At
present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on
galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained
representations of the properties of the interstellar medium and black hole
accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these
effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a
multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation
pressurises highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state. We
show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger
gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by
including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive black holes in
galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric
luminosity of accreting black holes to the surrounding gas, we show how this
feedback regulates the growth of black holes. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies,
we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central AGN activity when
the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an

marginally consistent with previous reports of a $\sim2000$ solar mass black

in one-particle spectral functions and in the charge, spin and d-wave pairing
susceptibility functions. We address the possible reduction of the two-band
model to a low-energy single-band one, as it was suggested by Zhang and Rice.
Comparing the two-band Hubbard model properties with the single-band Hubbard
model ones, we have found similar low-energy physics provided that the
next-nearest-neighbor hopping term t' has a significant value ($t'/t \approx
0.3$). The parameter t' is the main culprit for the electron-hole asymmetry.
However, a significant value of t' cannot be provided in a strict Zhang and
Rice picture where the extra holes added into the system bind to the existing
Cu holes forming local singlets. We notice that by considering approximate
singlet states, such as plaquette ones, reasonable values of t', which capture
qualitatively the physics of the two-band model can be obtained. We conclude
that a single-band t-t'-U Hubbard model captures the basic physics of the
cuprates concerning superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, pseudogap and
electron-hole asymmetry, but is not suitable for a quantitative analysis or to
describe physical properties involving energy scales larger than about 0.5 eV.

effective interaction between the particles of such pairs. In geometries
appropriate for the CuO$_{2}$ planes of cuprate superconductors, armchair
Carbon nanotubes or Cobalt Oxides planes, the dressed pair becomes a bound
state in a physically relevant range of parameters. We also show that W=0 pairs
quantize the magnetic flux like superconducting pairs do. The pairing mechanism
breaks down in the presence of strong distortions. The W=0 pairs are also the
building blocks for the antiferromagnetic ground state of the half-filled
Hubbard model at weak coupling. Our analytical results for the $4\times 4$
Hubbard square lattice, compared to available numerical data, demonstrate that
the method, besides providing intuitive grasp on pairing, also has quantitative
predictive power. We also consider including phonon effects in this scenario.
Preliminary calculations with small clusters indicate that vector phonons
hinder pairing while half-breathing modes are synergic with the W=0 pairing
mechanism both at weak coupling and in the polaronic regime.

years as, e.g., scaling of number of attractor with system size. Recently it
was found that this number scales superpolynomially with system size, contrary
to a common earlier expectation of sublinear scaling. We here point to the fact
that these results are obtained using deterministic parallel update, where a
large fraction of attractors in fact are an artifact of the updating scheme.
This limits the significance of these results for biological systems where
noise is omnipresent. We here take a fresh look at attractors in Boolean
networks with the original motivation of simplified models for biological
systems in mind. We test stability of attractors w.r.t. infinitesimal
deviations from synchronous update and find that most attractors found under
parallel update are artifacts arising from the synchronous clocking mode. The
remaining fraction of attractors are stable against fluctuating response
delays. For this subset of stable attractors we observe sublinear scaling of
the number of attractors with system size.

the band structure, and by an increasing interest on the role of Berry phase in
spintronics, we studied the adiabatic motion of a wave packet of Bloch
functions, under a perturbation varying slowly and incommensurately to the
lattice structure. We show using only the fundamental principles of quantum
mechanics that its effective wave-packet dynamics is conveniently described by
a set of equations of motion (EOM) for a semiclassical particle coupled to a
nonabelian gauge field associated with a geometric Berry phase. Our EOM can be
viewed as a generalization of the standard Ehrenfest's theorem, and their
derivation was asymptotically exact in the framework of linear response theory.
Our analysis is entirely based on the concept of local Bloch bands, a good
starting point for describing the adiabatic motion of a wave packet. One of the
advantages of our approach is that the various types of gauge fields were
classified into two categories by their different physical origin: (i)
projection onto specific bands, (ii) time-dependent local Bloch basis. Using
those gauge fields, we write our EOM in a covariant form, whereas the
gauge-invariant field strength stems from the noncommutativity of covariant
derivatives along different axes of the reciprocal parameter space. The
degeneracy of Bloch bands makes the gauge fields nonabelian. We applied our
formalism to the analyses on various types of Hall and polarization currents.
We highlighted their behavior under time reversal (T) and space inversion (I).
The concept of parity polarization current was also introduced. Together with
charge/spin Hall/polarization currents, this type of orbital current is
expected to be a potential probe for detecting and controling Berry phase.

of making a further distinction on the absolute background of space-time and
the relative length or duration of base units of space-time. Just based on the
existence of the absolute background for space, an explicit dynamical equation
which satisfies a moderately general principle of relativity is logically
derived under the nonrelativistic framework of classical mechanics. The nature
of the inertial force is firstly revealed as the real forces acting on the
reference object. Therefore, Einstein's equivalence principle should be
abandoned and only the numerical equality between the inertial mass and
gravitational mass can be retained. Consequently, the candidate for the
standard clock should be changed and an adjusted physical picture for how to
convert the gravitational force into a geometric effect on space-time is
thereby presented. As for cosmology, it should be emphasized that the observer
at the present time on the earth, instead of the comoving observer, is the only
true observer. The coordinate time ""t"" in the cosmological metric is just
introduced as the reading number of the observational clock, whose running rate
is duplicated from the clock equipped by the observer at the present time on
the earth. With this new physical picture of space-time, an extra factor $b(t)$
must be introduced into the cosmological metric to describe the gravitational
time dilation effect since the comoving local intrinsic clock will run in a
faster and faster rate with the expanding of the universe. In this way, we may
obtain a positive value of $\rho+3p$ and avoid the introduction of dark energy
in the current universe.

Cross sections of Coulomb scattering of electrons, Muller scattering, Compton
effect, electron self-energy, vacuum polarization, anomalous magnetic moment of
electron, Lamb shift of atomic energy levels are calculated. The possibility of
the scattering matrix expansion in powers of the coupling constant, in which
matrix elements contain no terms with fermion propagators, is demonstrated for
external fermion lines corresponding to real particles (antiparticles).
  It is shown that a method to include the interaction of real particles with
antiparticles in the FW representation is to introduce negative mass particles
and antiparticles to the theory. The theory is degenerate with respect to the
particle (antiparticle) mass sign, however the masses of the particle and
antiparticle interacting with each other should be of opposite sign.
  QED in the FW representation is invariant under C, P, T inversions. The weak
interaction breaks the C and P invariance, but preserves the combined CP
parity. In the theory there is a possibility to relate the break of CP
invariance to total or partial removal of the degeneracy in particle

show ``almost integrability'' of the the original two-dimensional classical
Hamilton system, and to reduce it to a one-dimensional one on the phase space
which is a two-dimensional torus. Using the topological methods for integrable
Hamiltonian system and elementary facts from the Morse theory, we give a
general classification of the classical motion. According this classification
the classical motion is separated into different regimes with different
topological characteristics (like rotation numbers and Maslov indices). Using
these regimes, the semiclassical approximation, the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and
the correspondence principle, we give a general asymptotic description of the

estimation for the number of subbands in each Landau band. From this point of

describes the features of the detector, and estimates signal and background

demonstrate that the value of the scalar polarizability extracted from the

  Drosophila embryo","20 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in J. theor. Biol",,,,"q-bio.CB",,"  During embryonic development, a spatial pattern is formed in which
proportions are established precisely. As an early pattern formation step in
Drosophila embryos, an anterior-posterior gradient of Bicoid (Bcd) induces
hunchback (hb) expression (Driever et al. 1989; Tautz et al. 1988). In contrast
to the Bcd gradient, the Hb profile includes information about the scale of the
embryo. Furthermore, the resulting hb expression pattern shows a much lower
embryo-to-embryo variability than the Bcd gradient (Houchmandzadeh et al.
2002). An additional graded posterior repressing activity could theoretically
account for the observed scaling. However, we show that such a model cannot
produce the observed precision in the Hb boundary, such that a fundamentally
different mechanism must be at work. We describe and simulate a model that can
account for the observed precise generation of the scaled Hb profile in a
highly robust manner. The proposed mechanism includes Staufen (Stau), an RNA
binding protein that appears essential to precision scaling (Houchmandzadeh et
al. 2002). In the model, Stau is released from both ends of the embryo and
relocalises hb RNA by increasing its mobility. This leads to an effective
transport of hb away from the respective Stau sources. The balance between
these opposing effects then gives rise to scaling and precision. Considering
the biological importance of robust precision scaling and the simplicity of the
model, the same principle may be employed more often during development.
