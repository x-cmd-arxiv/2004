experienced by gas in the infalling envelope. This means that radiation
pressure is a much less significant barrier to massive star formation than has
previously been thought.

collected in the 2004 season. Altogether about 800 and 1500 epochs were
collected for the fields of both campaigns, respectively.
  The search for low depth transits was conducted on about 230000 stars with
photometry better than 15 mmag. It was focused on detection of planetary
companions, thus clear non-planetary cases were not included in the final list
of selected objects. Altogether we discovered 40 stars with shallow (<0.05 mag)
flat-bottomed transits. In each case several individual transits were observed
allowing determination of photometric elements. Additionally, the lower limits
on radii of the primary and companion were calculated. From the photometric
point of view the new OGLE sample contains many very good candidates for
extrasolar transiting planets. However, only the future spectroscopic follow-up
observations of the OGLE sample - determination of the amplitude of radial
velocity and exclusion of blending possibilities - may allow to confirm their
planetary status. In general, the transiting objects may be extrasolar planets,
brown dwarfs, M-type dwarfs or fake transits caused by blending. All
photometric data of objects with transiting companions discovered during the
2003 campaigns are available to the astronomical community from the OGLE

features (the low ionization component) being close to photoionization
equilibrium. The gas responsible for the Fe (XVII-XXII) L-shell absorption (the
high ionization component), does not seem to be responding as expected in

a density >1E4 cm-3, and so locates the gas within 6 pc of the X-ray source.

dust-scattered, linearly polarized star light from unpolarized direct star
light. This unique technique allows us to probe faint reflection nebulae around
the bright central star, which can be buried under the point-spread-function of

These images have revealed the circumstellar dust distribution in an
unprecedented detail via polarized intensity maps, providing a basis to
understand the 3-D structure of these dust shells. We have observationally
confirmed the presence of the inner cavity caused by the cessation of AGB mass
loss and the internal shell structures which is strongly tied to the progenitor
star's mass loss history on the AGB. We have also found that equatorial
enhancement in these circumstellar shells comes with various degrees of
contrast, suggesting a range of optical depths in these optically thin shells.
Our data support the interpretation that the dichotomy of PPN morphologies is
due primarily to differences in optical depth and secondary to the inclination
effect. The polarization maps reveal a range of inclination angles for these
optically thin reflection nebulae, dispelling the notion that elliptical
nebulae are pole-on bipolar nebulae.

high-density parts of large HI rings/arcs formed by dynamical interaction
between galaxy groups and gas-rich, low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies with
extended gas disks. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that the group
tidal field is very efficient at stripping the outer HI gas of the disk if the
gaseous disk of the LSB galaxy extends $2 - 5$ times further than the stellar
disk. We find that a massive, extended `leading stream' orbiting the group's
center can form out of the stripped outer HI envelope, while the severely
shrunk LSB galaxy, whose stellar disk remains unaffected, continues on its
path. The result is a relatively isolated, massive HI cloud with a ring- or
arc-like shape, a very inhomogeneous density distribution ($N_{\rm HI} \sim 1.0
\times 10^{17} - 1.1 \times 10^{20}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$), and, initially, no
stellar content. Only the high density peaks of the simulated intragroup HI
ring/arc can be detected in many current HI observations. These will appear as
relatively isolated `HI islands' near the group center. We also find that star
formation can occur within the ring/arc, if the total gas mass within the
intragroup ring/arc is very large ($\sim$ 4 $\times$ $10^9$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$).
We discuss these results in terms of existing observations of intragroup gas
(e.g., the Leo Ring and HIPASS J0731--69) and intergalactic HII regions.

The large EW of the Fe K line poses a problem with interpreting the hard X-ray
emission as integrated X-ray binary emission. A thermal emission spectrum with
a temperature of kT~7 keV modified by some absorption, which would be expected
from an internally shocked hot bubble in a starburst region, can describe the
spectrum. An ensemble of radio supernovae in a dense environment, as suggested
from VLBI imaging, could be another possibility, if frequent occurence of such
powerful supernovae is sustained. However, the apparent lack of X-ray binary
emission does not match the high supernova rate required by both
interpretations. Highly photoionized, low-density gas illuminated by a hidden
Compton-thick AGN is a possible alternative, which can be tested by
presence/absence of radiative recombination continua in better quality data
expected from a forthcoming observation.

data. The gamma-ray spectrum is consistent with a single power-law of photon
index -1.72 +/- 0.15. The fluence (20-200 keV) was 8.2 x 10^-7 erg cm^-2. The
X-ray afterglow (F_nu (t) propto nu^-beta_X t^-delta) was extremely hard with
beta_X = 0.47 +/- 0.01 and delta = 1.46 +/- 0.04. The 2-10 keV flux 11 hours

consistent with the observed trends from previous analysis of BATSE GRBs. We
find that the X-ray data are not well-fit by either a simple spherical fireball

environment. Based on previously determined correlations between GRB spectra
and redshift, we estimate a redshift of ~0.9^+0.5_-0.4 (1 sigma) and a lower

absorption features corresponding to the strongest component of the CaII IR
triplet appear in the spectra from 7 days before to 2 days after B-band
maximum, at a high velocity (~22,000 km/s). Before these features emerge, the
CaII IR triplet has an anomalously high velocity, indicating that the narrow
features were still blended with the main, photospheric component.
High-velocity CaII absorption has been observed in other SNe Ia, but usually
detached from the photospheric component. Furthermore, the SiII 6355A line is
observed at a comparably high velocity (~20,000 km/s) 9 and 7 days before B
maximum, but then it suddenly shifts to much lower velocities. Synthetic
spectra are used to reproduce the data under various scenarios. An abundance
enhancement requires an outer region dominated by Si and Ca, the origin of
which is not easy to explain in terms of nuclear burning. A density enhancement
leads to a good reproduction of the spectral evolution if a mass of ~0.10 Msun
is added at velocities between 16,000 and 28,000 km/s, and it may result from a
perturbation, possibly angular, of the explosion. An improved match to the CaII
IR triplet at the earliest epoch can be obtained if the outermost part of this
modified density profile is assumed to be dominated by H (~0.004 Msun above
24,000 km/s). Line broadening is then the result of increased electron
scattering. This H may be the result of interaction between the ejecta and
circumstellar material.

of the cosmological component depends drastically on our ability for removing
foregrounds. We provide an analytical expression to estimate the level of the
residual polarization for Galactic foregrounds, according to the method
employed for their subtraction. We interpret this result in terms of the lower
limit of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r that allows to disentangle the
cosmological B-mode polarization from the foregrounds contribution. Polarized
emission from extragalactic radio sources and gravitational lensing is also
taken into account. As a first approach, we consider the ideal limit of an
instrumental noise--free experiment: for a full--sky coverage and a degree
resolution, we obtain a limit of r~10^(-4). This value can be improved by
high--resolution experiments and, in principle, no clear fundamental limit on
the detectability of gravitational waves polarization is found. Our analysis is
also applied to planned or hypothetical future polarization experiments, taking
into account expected noise levels.

more than one physical parameter besides the BH spin. The observed dichotomy
between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs is well interpreted by the two
parameters, the BH spin and the power-law index of the variation of the
magnetic field on the disc. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation of jet
powers with radio loudness of AGNs in terms of the two parameters. It is found
that the contours of radio loudness are approximately in accord with those of
jet powers for several 3CR radio sources, implying roughly that the stronger
jet power corresponds to stronger radio loudness. In addition we discuss the
correlation of the jet powers and radio-loudness of AGNs with the position of
the inner edge of an accretion disc. These results imply that the spin paradigm

that repeat in two consecutive rotation cycles. These peaks may indicate the
presence of compact emitting regions in the quiescent corona. Centroid shifts
as a function of phase in the strongest line profile, O VIII 18.97 A, indicate
Doppler rotational velocities with a semi-amplitude of 30 +/- 10 km/s. By
taking these diagnostics into account along with constraints on the rotational
broadening of line profiles (provided by archival Chandra HETG Fe XVII and FUSE

requires two components. One of these components is responsible for 80% of the
X-ray emission, and arises from the pole and/or a homogeneously distributed
corona. The second component consists of two or three compact active regions
that cause modulation in the lightcurve and contribute to the O VIII centroid
shifts. These compact regions account for 16% of the emission and are located
near the stellar surface with heights of less than 0.3R*. At least one of the
compact active regions is located in the partially obscured hemisphere of the
inclined star, while one of the other active regions may be located at 40

a clustering length in the range ro=12-17h^{-1}Mpc, implying that EROs trace

association of EROs with galaxy overdensities by smoothing the K-band galaxy
distribution using the matched filter algorithm of Postman et al. (1996) and
then cross-correlating the resulting density maps with the ERO positions. Our

rotating Black Holes has been made: standard disks are truncated at some radius
depending on the accretion rate so that disk outflows are driven by the inner
hot advective disk. Slow outflows are the norm when the magnetorotational
instability is at work for the case of weak fields. In order to achieve Lorentz
factors of about 10, strong large-scale magnetic fields must thread the Black

discontinuous nonequilibrium transition from a uniform stick state to uniform
sliding at some critical stress which is nothing but the Griffith threshold for
crack propagation. An inhomogeneous mode of sliding occurs, when the driving
velocity is prescribed instead of the external stress. A transition to
homogeneous sliding occurs at a critical velocity, which is related to the
critical stress. We solve the elastic problem for a steady-state motion of a
periodic stick-slip pattern and derive equations of motion for the tip and
resticking end of the slip pulses. In the slip regions we use the linear
viscous friction law and do not assume any intrinsic instabilities even at
small sliding velocities. We find that, as in many other pattern forming
system, the steady-state analysis itself does not select uniquely all the
internal parameters of the pattern, especially the primary wavelength. Using
some plausible analogy to first order phase transitions we discuss a ``soft''
selection mechanism. This allows to estimate internal parameters such as crack
velocities, primary wavelength and relative fraction of the slip phase as
function of the driving velocity. The relevance of our results to recent

the relevance of topological features for the dynamic behavior of metabolic
networks, food webs, production systems, information networks, or cascade
failures of power grids remains to be explored. Based on a simple model of
supply networks, we offer an interpretation of instabilities and oscillations
observed in biological, ecological, economic, and engineering systems.
  We find that most supply networks display damped oscillations, even when
their units - and linear chains of these units - behave in a non-oscillatory
way. Moreover, networks of damped oscillators tend to produce growing
oscillations. This surprising behavior offers, for example, a new
interpretation of business cycles and of oscillating or pulsating processes.
The network structure of material flows itself turns out to be a source of
instability, and cyclical variations are an inherent feature of decentralized
adjustments. In particular, we show how to treat production and supply networks
as transport problems governed by balance equations and equations for the
adaptation of production speeds.
  The stability and dynamic behavior of supply networks is investigated for
different topologies, including sequential supply chains, ""supply circles"",
""supply ladders"", and ""supply hierarchies"". Moreover, analytical conditions for
absolute and convective instabilities are derived. The empirically observed
bullwhip effect in supply chains is explained as a form of convective
instability based on resonance effects. An application of this theory to the
optimization of production networks has large optimization potentials.

methods to simulate binary fluid mixtures -- both in the presence and in the
absence of colloidal particles. Two types of scaling problem arise: physical
and computational. Physical scaling concerns how to relate simulation
parameters to those of the real world. To do this effectively requires careful
physics, because (in common with other methods) lattice Boltzmann cannot fully
resolve the hierarchy of length, energy and time scales that arise in typical
flows of complex fluids. Care is needed in deciding what physics to resolve and
what to leave unresolved, particularly when colloidal particles are present in
one or both of two fluid phases. This influences steering of simulation
parameters such as fluid viscosity and interfacial tension. When the physics is
anisotropic (for example, in systems under shear) careful adaptation of the
geometry of the simulation box may be needed; an example of this, relating to
our study of the effect of colloidal particles on the Rayleigh-Plateau
instability of a fluid cylinder, is described. The second and closely related
set of scaling issues are computational in nature: how do you scale up
simulations to very large lattice sizes? The problem is acute for systems
undergoing shear flow. Here one requires a set of blockwise co-moving frames to
the fluid, each connected to the next by a Lees-Edwards like boundary
condition. These matching planes lead to small numerical errors whose
cumulative effects can become severe; strategies for minimising such effects
are discussed.

antiferromagnetic interactions are frustrated in this structure.
Antiferromagnetic order occurs below T_N = 12K with propagation vector (0, 0,

spontaneous magnetization. The mixed phase is stable whereas the other
superconducting phases that usually exist in unconventional superconductors are
either unstable, or, for particular values of the parameters of the theory,
some of these phases are metastable at relatively low temperatures in a quite
narrow domain of the phase diagram. The phase transitions from the normal phase
to the phase of coexistence is of first order while the phase transition from
the ferromagnetic phase to the coexistence phase can be either of first or
second order depending on the concrete substance. The Cooper pair and crystal
anisotropy are relevant to a more precise outline of the phase diagram shape
and reduce the degeneration of the ground states of the system but they do not
drastically influence the phase stability domains and the thermodynamic
properties of the respective phases.

solve the rate equation exactly leading to size distributions of Bessel type

explicit formulas for the expansion coefficients in terms of Airy functions.
Introducing the coagulation term, the full non-linear model is mapped exactly

decay, $\exp(-x)$, for large $x$, and observe a crossover from the Bessel

Gbps with the emergence of faster link technologies. New applications are
coming up which require intelligent processing at the intermediate routers.
Switches and routers are becoming the bottlenecks in fast communication. On one
hand faster links deliver more packets every second and on the other hand
intelligent processing consumes more CPU cycles at the router. The conflicting
goals of providing faster but computationally expensive processing call for new
approaches in designing routers.
  This survey takes a look at the core functionalities, like packet
classification, buffer memory management, switch scheduling and output link
scheduling performed by a router in its data path processing and discusses the
algorithms that aim to reduce the performance bound for these operations. An
important requirement for the routers is to provide Quality of Service
guarantees. We propose an algorithm to guarantee QoS in Input Queued Routers.
The hardware solution to speed up router operation was Application Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs). But the inherent inflexibility of the method is a
demerit as network standards and application requirements are constantly
evolving, which seek a faster turnaround time to keep up with the changes. The
promise of Network Processors (NP) is the flexibility of general-purpose
processors together with the speed of ASICs. We will study the architectural
choices for the design of Network Processors and focus on some of the
commercially available NPs. There is a plethora of NP vendors in the market.

Apart from the
tracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either
to steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator
about the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality
measure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated
observations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could
be the Kullback-Leibler difference.
  We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some
terrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and ""meta-sensors""
with force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different
size. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle
filters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their
sub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of
those sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.
  Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior
PHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to
three or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a
mapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on
doctrine knowledge of unit configuration.
  The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using
some measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a
bounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a
discretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the
measure locally to different parts of the space.

it to target detection and association problems arising in pre-processing for
multi-target tracking.
  Here we consider the problem of pre-processing for multiple target tracking
when the number of sensor reports received is very large and arrives in large
bursts. In this case, it is sometimes necessary to pre-process reports before
sending them to tracking modules in the fusion system. The pre-processing step
associates reports to known tracks (or initializes new tracks for reports on
objects that have not been seen before). It could also be used as a pre-process
step before clustering, e.g., in order to test how many clusters to use.
  The pre-processing is done by solving an approximate version of the original
problem. In this approximation, not all pair-wise conflicts are calculated. The
approximation relies on knowing how many such pair-wise conflicts that are
necessary to compute. To determine this, results on phase-transitions occurring
when coloring (or clustering) large random instances of a particular graph

blow-up leading to gradient catastrophes, while the other is based upon the
ODE-mechanism leading to blow-ups within finite time. We show how both
mechanisms work in the case of a simple one-dimensional wave equation with a
dynamic wave speed and sources, and later explore how those blow-ups can appear
in one-dimensional numerical relativity. In the latter case we recover the well
known ``gauge shocks'' associated with Bona-Masso type slicing conditions.
However, a crucial result of this study has been the identification of a second
family of blow-ups associated with the way in which the constraints have been
used to construct a hyperbolic formulation. We call these blow-ups ``constraint
shocks'' and show that they are formulation specific, and that choices can be
made to eliminate them or at least make them less severe.

product of the LLR analysis used by current and future spacecraft missions. The
analysis is sensitive to astronomical parameters such as orbit, masses and
obliquity. The dissipation-caused semimajor axis rate is 37.9 mm/yr and the
associated acceleration in orbital longitude is -25.7 ''/cent^2, dominated by
tides on Earth with a 1% lunar contribution. Lunar rotational variation has
sensitivity to interior structure, physical properties, and energy dissipation.
The second-degree lunar Love numbers are detected; k_2 has an accuracy of 11%.
Lunar tidal dissipation is strong and its Q has a weak dependence on tidal
frequency. A fluid core of about 20% the Moon's radius is indicated by the
dissipation data. Evidence for the oblateness of the lunar
fluid-core/solid-mantle boundary is getting stronger. This would be independent
evidence for a fluid lunar core. Moon-centered coordinates of four
retroreflectors are determined. Station positions and motion, Earth rotation
variations, nutation, and precession are determined from analyses. Extending
the data span and improving range accuracy will yield improved and new
scientific results. Adding either new retroreflectors or precise active
transponders on the Moon would improve the accuracy of the science results.

equivalence relation between the longitudinal Kaluza-Klein gauge modes and
their respective would-be Goldstone bosons is extended to consistently include
the energetically suppressed terms in the high-energy scatterings. Demanding
perturbative unitarity, we compute upper limits on the number of the
Kaluza-Klein modes. We find that these limits weakly depend on the size of the
brane kinetic terms.

collapsing to form a black hole will radiate away the associated external

wavelength of the gauge boson (assuming natural units). Since the Compton
wavelength for a massive gauge boson is directly related to the scale of
symmetry breaking, the timescale for a black hole to lose its gauge field
""hair"" is determined only by this scale. The timescale for Hawking radiation,
however, is set by the mass of the black hole. These different dependencies
mean that for any (sub-Planckian) scale of symmetry breaking we can define a
mass below which black holes radiate quickly enough to discharge themselves via
the Hawking process before the gauge field is radiated away. This has important
implications for the extrapolation of classical black hole physics to
Planck-scale virtual black holes. In particular, we comment on the implications
for protecting protons from gravitationally mediated decay.

restricted to the subspace invariant under the orbifold projection symmetry,
and the large N dynamics of the daughter theory, restricted to the untwisted

equality, in the large N limit, between appropriately identified connected

projection symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the parent theory and the
theory space permutation symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the daughter.

  collisions",,,,,"nucl-th",,"  In this PhD thesis we analyze the medium modification of the pi-omega-rho
coupling and subsequently discuss its possible influence on the dilepton
production rate in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The first part of the
thesis is devoted to the medium modifications of the Dalitz decays from the
omega and rho mesons in nuclear matter. We use the relativistic field theory
formalism describing modifications of the coupling by one-loop Feynman diagrams
with nucleons and Delta(1232) isobars. We consider cases when the decaying
particle is at rest or at motion with respect to the medium. We investigate the
dependence of medium effects on the dilepton invariant mass and observe a
sizeable increase of the effective coupling constants compared to their vacuum
values. The effect grows with density. In the second part of the thesis we
apply our model to evaluate the influence of the medium effects on the dilepton
production from the Dalitz decays. In the calculations of the dilepton spectrum
we use the model of the hydrodynamic expansion of the fire cylinder. In our
comparison to the CERES dilepton data we take into account the experimental
cuts. The medium modifications enhance the effect of the Dalitz decays. It is
worth to point out that in the medium the rho decay due to the isospin
degeneracy becomes as important as the omega decay. The main new and original
results of the thesis are: 1. Significant in-medium increase of the
pi-omega-rho coupling constant. 2. Large enhancement of the Dalitz decays from
the omega and rho mesons in the range 0.2-0.6 GeV of the dilepton invariant
mass.

of view of MHD turbulence in accretion disks, is the class of {\em trans-slow
Alfven continuum modes}, that occur when the poloidal flow exceeds a critical
value of the slow magnetosonic speed. When this happens, virtually every
magnetic/flow surface of the disk becomes unstable with respect to highly
localized modes of the continuous spectrum. The mode structures rotate, in
turn, about the rotating disk. These structure lock and become explosively
unstable when the mass of the central object is increased beyond a certain
critical value. Their growth rates then become huge, of the order of the Alfven
transit time. These instabilities appear to have all requisite properties to
facilitate accretion flows across magnetic surfaces and jet formation.[1] R.

to relativistic energy within a few electromagnetic wave cycles through the

acceleration (EMRA). We find that the electron acceleration depends not only on
the electromagnetic wave intensity, but also on the ratio between electron
Larmor frequency and electromagnetic wave frequency. As the ratio approaches to
unity, a clear resonance peak is observed, corresponding to the EMRA. Near the
resonance regime, the strong magnetic fields still affect the electron
acceleration dramatically. We derive an approximate analytical solution of the
relativistic electron energy in adiabatic limit, which provides a full
understanding of this phenomenon. In typical parameters of pulsar
magnetospheres, the mechanism allows particles to increase their energies
through the resonance of high magnetic field and high frequency electromagnetic
wave in each electromagnetic wave period. The energy spectra of the accelerated
particles exhibit the synchrotron radiation behavior. These can help to
understand the remaining emission of high energy electron from radio pulsar

capture the behavior of the collagen microfibrils. On the macrolevel, the
network of collagen chains is represented by a transversely isotropic eight
chain unit cell introducing one characteristic material axis. Biomechanically
induced remodeling is captured by allowing for a continuous reorientation of
the predominant unit cell axis driven by a biomechanical stimulus. To this end,
we adopt the gradual alignment of the unit cell axis with the direction of
maximum principal strain. The evolution of the unit cell axis' orientation is
governed by a first-order rate equation. For the temporal discretization of the
remodeling rate equation, we suggest an exponential update scheme of
Euler-Rodrigues type. For the spatial discretization, a finite element strategy
is applied which introduces the current individual cell orientation as an
internal variable on the integration point level. Selected model problems are
analyzed to illustrate the basic features of the new model. Finally, the

bath can cool its state, i.e., increase its polarization or ground state
occupation probability. Starting from an unpolarized state of the spin in
equilibrium with the bath, one can reach very low temperatures or sizeable
polarizations within a time shorter than the decoherence time. Both the bath
and external fields are necessary for the effect which comes from the
backreaction of the spin on the bath. This method can be applied to cool at
once a disordered ensemble of spins. Since the bath is crucial for this
mechanism, the cooling limits are set by the strength of its interaction with
the spin(s).

that learn Boolean functions from quantum queries and quantum examples.
  Hunziker et al. conjectured that for any class C of Boolean functions, the
number of quantum black-box queries which are required to exactly identify an
unknown function from C is $O(\frac{\log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$,
where $\hat{\gamma}^{C}$ is a combinatorial parameter of the class C. We
essentially resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by giving a quantum
algorithm that, for any class C, identifies any unknown function from C using
$O(\frac{\log |C| \log \log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$ quantum black-box
queries.
  We consider a range of natural problems intermediate between the exact
learning problem (in which the learner must obtain all bits of information
about the black-box function) and the usual problem of computing a predicate
(in which the learner must obtain only one bit of information about the
black-box function). We give positive and negative results on when the quantum
and classical query complexities of these intermediate problems are
polynomially related to each other.
  Finally, we improve the known lower bounds on the number of quantum examples
(as opposed to quantum black-box queries) required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC
learning any concept class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension d over the domain
$\{0,1\}^n$ from $\Omega(\frac{d}{n})$ to $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log
\frac{1}{\delta}+d+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon})$. This new lower bound comes
closer to matching known upper bounds for classical PAC learning.

field in which the discrete vector indices in Maxwell\s equations are replaced
by continuous angular freedoms, and develop the corresponding Lagrangian
picture in which the fluid particles have rotational and translational
freedoms. This enables us to extend to the electromagnetic field the exact
method of state construction proposed previously for spin 0 systems, in which
the time-dependent wavefunction is computed from a single-valued continuum of
deterministic trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a
single orbit. The deduction of Maxwell\s equations from continuum mechanics is
achieved by generalizing the spin 0 theory to a general Riemannian manifold
from which the electromagnetic construction is extracted as a special case. In
particular, the flat-space Maxwell equations are represented as a curved-space
Schr\""odinger equation for a massive system. The Lorentz covariance of the
Eulerian field theory is obtained from the non-covariant Lagrangian-coordinate
model as a kind of collective effect. The method makes manifest the
electromagnetic analogue of the quantum potential that is tacit in Maxwell\s
equations. This implies a novel definition of the \classical limit\ of
Maxwell\s equations that differs from geometrical optics. It is shown that
Maxwell\s equations may be obtained by canonical quantization of the classical
model. Using the classical trajectories a novel expression is derived for the
propagator of the electromagnetic field in the Eulerian picture. The trajectory
and propagator methods of solution are illustrated for the case of a light
wave.

incorporate mathematical constraints, which make no assumptions as to the
actual physical nature of the system being described. By contrast, the
procedure presented here ensures physicality by placing physical constraints on
the nature of quantum processes. This allows quantum process tomography to be
performed using a smaller experimental data set, and produces parameters with a
direct physical interpretation. The approach is demonstrated by example of
mode-matching in an all-optical controlled-NOT gate. The techniques described
are non-specific and could be applied to other optical circuits or quantum

state may alter the decay rate of the state. This is called the quantum Zeno
effect (QZE) or the anti-Zeno effect (AZE), depending on whether the decay is
suppressed or enhanced. In conventional theories of the QZE and AZE, effects of
measurements are simply described by the projection postulate, assuming that
each measurement is an instantaneous and ideal one. However, real measurements
are not instantaneous and ideal. For the QZE and AZE by such general
measurements, interesting and surprising features have recently been revealed,
which we review in this article. The results are based on the quantum
measurement theory, which is also reviewed briefly. As a typical model, we
consider a continuous measurement of the decay of an excited atom by a
photodetector that detects a photon emitted from the atom upon decay. This
measurement is an indirect negative-result one, for which the curiosity of the
QZE and AZE is emphasized. It is shown that the form factor is renormalized as
a backaction of the measurement, through which the decay dynamics is modified.
In a special case of the flat response, where the detector responds to every
photon mode with an identical response time, results of the conventional
theories are reproduced qualitatively. However, drastic differences emerge in
general cases where the detector responds only to limited photon modes. For
example, against predictions of the conventional theories, the QZE or AZE may
take place even for states that exactly follow the exponential decay law. We
also discuss relation to the cavity quantum electrodynamics.
