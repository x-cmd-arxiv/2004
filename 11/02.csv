well established in many deep radio surveys. There are strong reasons,
observationally and theoretically, to believe that this up-turn is due to
strong evolution of the starforming population up to z=2. However this
hypothesis needs further confirmation spectroscopically and the examples in the
literature are sparse. Theoretically the up-turn is well modelled by the
evolution of the local radio starforming population and is consistent with the
up-turn seen in recent mid-infrared source counts at 15um (ISOCAM) and 24um
(Spitzer) and the tight correlation of the radio and MIR Luminosities of
starforming galaxies.

the universe is strongly influenced by small-scale gas inhomogeneities due to
structure formation. These inhomogeneities include both collapsed minihalos,
which are generally self-shielding, and lower-density structures, which are
not. The minihalos are dense and sufficiently optically-thick to trap
intergalactic ionization fronts, blocking their path and robbing them of
ionizing photons until the minihalo gas is expelled as an evaporative wind. The
lower-density structures do not trap these fronts, but they can slow them down
by increasing the overall recombination rate in the intergalactic medium. In
this paper we study the effects of both types of inhomogeneities, including
nonlinear clustering effects, and we find that both IGM clumping and collapsed
minihalos have significant yet qualitatively different impacts on reionization.
While the number density of minihalos on average increases strongly with time,
the density of minihalos inside H II regions around ionizing sources is largely
constant. Thus the impact of minihalos is essentially to decrease the number of
ionizing photons available to the IGM at all epochs, which is equivalent to a
reduction in the luminosity of each source. On the other hand, the effect of
IGM clumping increases strongly with time, slowing down reionization and
extending it. Thus while the impact of minihalos is largely degenerate with the
unknown source efficiency, IGM clumping can help significantly in reconciling
the recent observations of cosmic microwave background polarization with quasar
absorption spectra at z~6, which together point to an early but extended
reionization epoch.

emitters can be significantly suppressed, which can result in a decrease in the
observed number of emitters at a given Lya flux. However, cosmological HII
regions surrounding the Lya emitting galaxies alleviate these effects. We use
simple models of the Lya line suppression that incorporate the presence of HII
regions to predict the overall effect of the Lya absorption on the Lya
luminosity function. We find, in agreement with other recent studies, that
unless ionizing sources are unusually strongly clustered, a fully neutral IGM
may be inconsistent with the large abundance of confirmed z=6.5 Lya emitters.
However, the presence of local HII regions prohibits placing a tight constraint
on the mean neutral fraction. We find x_HI < 0.25; the presence of strong winds
and/or the clustering of ionizing sources would further weaken this constraint.
We conclude that the evolution of the Lya LF is consistent with reionization
occurring near this redshift. Finally, we suggest that a measurement of
observed Lya line width as a function of the Lya luminosity, in a future,
larger sample of Lya emitters, may serve as a robust diagnostic of the neutral
fraction in the IGM.

synchrotron (SYN), synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and external Compton on CMB
photons (EC). For the SYN sources -- mostly jet-knots in nearby low-luminosity
radio galaxies -- X-ray photons are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons
with energies 10-100 TeV that must be accelerated in situ. For the other
objects, conservatively classified as SSC or EC sources, a simple formulation
of calculating the ``expected'' X-ray fluxes under an equipartition hypothesis
is presented. We confirmed that the observed X-ray fluxes are close to the
expected ones for non-relativistic emitting plasma velocities in the case of
radio lobes and majority of hotspots, whereas considerable fraction of
jet-knots is too bright at X-rays to be explained in this way. We examined two
possibilities to account for the discrepancy in a framework of the
inverse-Compton model: (1) magnetic field is much smaller than the
equipartition value, and (2) the jets are highly relativistic on kpc/Mpc
scales. We concluded, that if the inverse-Compton model is the case, the X-ray
bright jet-knots are most likely far from the minimum-power condition. We also
briefly discuss the other possibility, namely that the observed X-ray emission

with the ESO CAT and Swiss Euler telescopes at La Silla. The interferometric
observations have confirmed the binary nature of the primary component and have
enabled the determination of the orbital parameters of the system. At the
observing wavelength of 442 nm the two components of the binary system have a
magnitude difference of 0.15. The combination of interferometric and
spectroscopic data gives the following results: orbital period 357 days,
semi-major axis 25.30 mas, inclination 67.4 degrees, eccentricity 0.821,
distance 102.3 pc, primary and secondary masses M1 = M2 = 9.1 solar masses and
absolute visual magnitudes of the primary and secondary M1V = -3.85 and M2V =
-3.70. The high accuracy of the results offers a fruitful starting point for
future asteroseismic modelling of the pulsating binary components.

the highest resolution (9.3"") this emission is resolved into two peaks which
are to within the uncertainties offset symmetrically from the star at 100AU
projected separation. Modeling the appearance of emission from a narrow ring in
the sub-mm images shows the observed structure cannot be caused by an edge-on
or face-on axisymmetric ring; the observations are consistent with a ring of
radius 150+-20AU seen at 45+-25deg inclination. More face-on orientations are
possible if the dust distribution includes two clumps similar to Vega; we show
how such a clumpy structure could arise from the migration over 25Myr of a
Neptune mass planet from 80-105AU. The inner 100AU of the system appears
relatively empty of sub-mm emitting dust, indicating that this region may have
been cleared by the formation of planets, but the disk emission spectrum shows
that IRAS detected an additional hot component with a characteristic
temperature of 370+-60K (implying a distance of 1-2AU). At 11.9um we found the
emission to be unresolved with no background sources which could be
contaminating the fluxes measured by IRAS. The age of this star is estimated to
be ~1Gyr. It is very unusual for such an old main sequence star to exhibit

which underlie the modern approaches to stochastic processes. His approach is
based on a random walk picture and is valid for Markovian processes lacking

the diffusion equation. However, many natural processes do not possess the
Markovian property and exhibit to anomalous diffusion. We consider here the
case of subdiffusive processes, which are semi-Markovian and correspond to
continuous-time random walks in which the waiting time for a step is given by a
probability distribution with a diverging mean value. Such a process can be
considered as a process subordinated to normal diffusion under operational time
which depends on this pathological waiting-time distribution. We derive two
different but equivalent forms of kinetic equations, which reduce to know
fractional diffusion or Fokker-Planck equations for waiting-time distributions
following a power-law. For waiting time distributions which are not pure power
laws one or the other form of the kinetic equation is advantageous, depending
on whether the process slows down or accelerates in the course of time.

cosmological constant caused by zero-point fluctuations. This cosmological
constant which multiplies the symmetric metric is assumed to be nearly
cancelled by Schrodinger's ``bare'' cosmological constant which multiplies the
nonsymmetric fundamental tensor, such that the total ``physical'' cosmological
matches measurement. We show that the resulting Lambda-renormalized
Einstein-Schrodinger theory closely approximates ordinary Einstein-Maxwell
theory and one-particle quantum mechanics. In particular, the field equations
match the ordinary Einstein and Maxwell equations except for additional terms
which are $<10^{-16}$ of the usual terms for worst-case field strengths and
rates-of-change accessible to measurement. We also show that the theory
predicts the exact Lorentz force equation and the exact Klein-Gordon and Dirac
equations. And the theory becomes exactly Einstein-Maxwell theory and
one-particle quantum mechanics in the limit as the cosmological constant from
zero-point fluctuations goes to infinity. Lastly, we discuss the merits of our
Lagrangian density compared to the Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian density.

simply the probability distributions for finding quarks and gluons in the

target spectators effects the leading-twist structure functions in a profound
way, leading to diffractive leptoproduction processes, shadowing and
antishadowing of nuclear structure functions, and target spin asymmetries,
physics not incorporated in the light-front wavefunctions of the target
computed in isolation. In particular, final-state interactions from gluon
exchange lead to single-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic
lepton-proton scattering which are not power-law suppressed in the Bjorken
limit. The shadowing and antishadowing of nuclear structure functions in the
Gribov-Glauber picture is due respectively to the destructive and constructive
interference of amplitudes arising from the multiple-scattering of quarks in
the nucleus. The effective quark-nucleon scattering amplitude includes Pomeron
and Odderon contributions from multi-gluon exchange as well as Reggeon
quark-exchange contributions. Part of the anomalous NuTeV result for

indicated by recent analysis using QCD Factorization. In this talk, I would
like to report on a recent work on power corrections in charmless B decays. By
using the ratio of the branching fraction of $B^+ \to \pi^+ K^{\ast 0}$ to that
of $B^0 \to \pi^- \rho^+$, for which the theoretical uncertainties are greatly
reduced, it is shown in a transparent manner that power corrections in
charmless B decays are probably large and that the $B^0 \to K^- \rho^+$ decay
could be explained with the annihilation term included. For ratios of direct CP
asymmetries, QCD Factorisation with the annihilation terms included would
predict the direct CP asymmetry of $B \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ to be about 3 times
larger than that of $B \to \pi^\pm K^\mp$, with opposite sign. In particular,
the large measured value for $B \to \pi^\pm K^\mp $ CP asymmetry implies
naturally a corresponding large $B \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ CP asymmetry as observed by
Belle. Experimentally any significant deviation from this prediction or
possibly the importance of long-distance rescattering effects.

components of the vector is based on combining the information in the subset of
observations with the non-missing components with updated estimates of the
location parameters from all subsets with even more missing components in an
iterative fashion. If the variance-covariance matrix is known, then the
resulting estimator is unbiased with the smallest variance provided missing
data are ignorable. It is also shown that the resulting estimator based on
consistent estimators of variance-covariance matrices obtains unbiasedness and
the smallest variance asymptotically. This approach can also be extended to
some cases of non-ignorable missing data. Applying the methodology to a data
with random dropouts yields the well known Kaplan-Meier estimator.

equilibrium between trapped (localized) and quasifree (extended) states has
been postulated for the excess electron (the two-state model). Using
time-resolved dc conductivity, the effect of 1064 nm laser photoexcitation of
trapped electrons on the charge transport has been observed in liquid n-hexane
and methylcyclohexane. The light promotes the electron from the trap into the
conduction band of the liquid, instantaneously increasing the conductivity by
orders of magnitude. From the analysis of the two-pulse, two-color
photoconductivity data, the residence time of the electrons in traps has been
estimated as ca. 8.4 ps for n-hexane and ca. 13 ps for methylcyclohexane (at
295 K). The rate of detrapping decreases at lower temperature with an
activation energy of ca. 200 meV (280-320 K); the lifetime-mobility product for
quasifree electrons scales linearly with the temperature. We suggest that the
properties of trapped electrons in hydrocarbon liquids can be well accounted
for using the simple electron bubble (Wigner-Seiz spherical well) model. The
estimated localization time of the quasifree electron is 20-50 fs; both time
estimates are in good agreement with the ""quasiballistic"" model. This
localization time is significantly lower than the value of ca. 300 fs obtained
using time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy for the same system [E. Knoesel

to acquire the right to benefit from them through the exchange of products

used to construct probabilistic models which can be subsequently sampled in
order to produce morphologically realistic neuronal cells. Such cells are
progressively grown while monitoring their connections along time, which are
analysed in terms of percolation concepts. However, unlike traditional
percolation, the critical point is verified along the growth stages, not the
density of cells, which remains constant throughout the neuronal growth
dynamics. It is shown, through simulations, that growing beta cells tend to

ionization suppression with destructive interference of outgoing electron waves
from the ionized electron orbital. However, the prediction of ionization
suppression, justified within the IMST approach through the symmetry of the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), is not reliable since it turns out
that, e.g. in the case of F$_2$, the electronic response to the laser pulse is
rather complicated and does not lead to dominant depletion of the HOMO.
Therefore, the symmetry of the HOMO is not sufficient to predict ionization
suppression. However, at least for F$_2$, the symmetry of the dominantly
ionized orbital is consistent with the non-suppression of ionization.

fields generated by an atom chip. Wire layouts, detailed experimental
procedures and results are presented for the following experiments: Use of a
magnetic conveyor belt for positioning of cold atoms and Bose-Einstein
condensates with a resolution of two nanometers; splitting of thermal clouds
and BECs in adjustable magnetic double well potentials; controlled splitting of
a cold reservoir. The devices that enable these manipulations can be combined
with each other. We demonstrate this by combining reservoir splitter and
conveyor belt to obtain a cold atom dispenser. We discuss the importance of
these devices for quantum information processing, atom interferometry and
Josephson junction physics on the chip. For all devices, absorption-image video
sequences are provided to demonstrate their time-dependent behaviour.

Maji","Towards Efficiently Solving Quantum Traveling Salesman Problem","4 pages, 3 tables, PRL (submitted)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a framework for efficiently solving Approximate Traveling Salesman
Problem (Approximate TSP) for Quantum Computing Models. Existing
representations of TSP introduce extra states which do not correspond to any
permutation. We present an efficient and intuitive encoding for TSP in quantum
computing paradigm. Using this representation and assuming a Gaussian
distribution on tour-lengths, we give an algorithm to solve Approximate TSP
(Euclidean) within BQP resource bounds. Generalizing this strategy for any
distribution, we present an oracle based Quantum Algorithm to solve Approximate
TSP. We present a realization of the oracle in the quantum counterpart of PP.

is used to obtain a simple criteria for the occurrence of S-wave quantum halo

particles in an oscillator potential, known as {\it{Hooke's}} atom. For the
planar Hooke's atom, the exact eigenstates and single particle densities for
arbitrary azimuthal quantum number, are obtained analytically. Information
entropies associated with the wave functions for the relative motion are then
studied systematically, since the same incorporates the effect of the Coulomb
interaction. The {\it{quantum pottery}} of the information entropy density
reveals a number of intricate structures, which differ significantly for the
attractive and repulsive cases. We indicate the procedure to obtain the
approximate eigen states. Making use of the relationship of this dynamical
system with the quasi-exactly solvable systems, one can also develop a suitable
perturbation theory, involving the Coulomb coupling $Z$, for the approximate
wave functions.
