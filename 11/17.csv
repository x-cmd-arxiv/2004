has twice the sample size of any previous ERO clustering study. The wide field
of view and BwRIK passbands of the NDWFS allow us to place improved constraints
on the clustering of z=1 EROs. We find the angular clustering of EROs is
slightly weaker than in previous measurements, and w(1')=0.25+/-0.05 for
K<18.40 EROs. We find no significant correlation of ERO spatial clustering with
redshift, apparent color or absolute magnitude, although given the
uncertainties, such correlations remain plausible. We find the spatial
clustering of K<18.40, R-K>5 EROs is well approximated by a power-law, with
r_0=9.7+/-1.1 Mpc/h in comoving coordinates. This is comparable to the
clustering of 4L* early-type galaxies at z<1, and is consistent with the
brightest EROs being the progenitors of the most massive ellipticals. There is
evidence of the angular clustering of EROs decreasing with increasing apparent
magnitude, when NDWFS measurements of ERO clustering are combined with those
from the literature. Unless the redshift distribution of K>20 EROs is very
broad, the spatial clustering of EROs decreases from r_0=9.7+/-1.1 Mpc/h for
K<18.40 to r_0=7.5 Mpc/h for K>20 EROs.

system 0047-2808 using our semi-linear inversion method developed in an earlier
paper. By introducing an adaptively gridded source plane, we are able to
eliminate the need for regularisation of the inversion. This removes the
problem of a poorly defined number of degrees of freedom, encountered by
inversion methods that employ regularisation, and so allows a proper
statistical comparison between models. We confirm the results of Wayth et al.
(2004), that the source is double, and that a power-law model gives a
significantly better fit that the singular isothermal ellipsoid model. We
measure a slope alpha=2.11+/-0.04. We find, further, that a dual-component
constant M/L baryonic + dark halo model gives a significantly better fit than
the power-law model, at the 99.7% confidence level. The inner logarithmic slope
of the dark halo profile is found to be 0.87^{+0.69}_{-0.61} (95% CL),
consistent with the predictions of CDM simulations of structure formation. We
determine an unevolved B-band mass to light ratio for the baryons (only) of
3.05^{+0.53}_{-0.90} h_65 M_sol/L_Bsol (95% CL). This is the first measurement
of the baryonic M/L of a single galaxy by purely gravitational lens methods.
The baryons account for 65^{+10}_{-18}% (95% CL) of the total projected mass,
or, assuming spherical symmetry, 84^{+12}_{-24}% (95% CL) of the total
three-dimensional mass within the mean radius of 1.16'' (7.5 h_65^{-1} kpc)
traced by the ring. Finally, at the level of >3sigma, we find that the halo
mass is rounder than the baryonic distribution and that the two components are
offset in orientation from one another.

  Science for publication in ""Advances in Space Research""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The electron-positron annihilation source in the Galactic center region has
recently been observed with INTEGRAL/SPI, which shows that this 511 keV source
is strong and its extension is consistent with the Galactic bulge geometry. The
positron production rate, estimated to more than 10$^{43}$ per second, is very
high and raises a challenging question about the nature of the Galactic
positron source. Commonly considered astrophysical positron injectors, namely
type Ia supernovae are rare events and fall short to explain the observed
positron production rate. In this paper, we study the possibility of Galactic
positron production by hypernovae events, exemplified by the recently observed
SN2003dh/GRB030329, an asymmetric explosion of a Wolf-Rayet star associated
with a gamma-ray burst. In these kinds of events, the ejected material becomes
quickly transparent to positrons, which spread out in the interstellar medium.
Non radioactive processes, such as decays of heavy dark matter particles
(neutralinos) predicted by most extensions of the standard model of particle
physics, could also produce positrons as byproducts. However they are expected
to be accompanied by a large flux of high-energy gamma-rays, which were not
observed by EGRET and ground based Tcherenkov experiments. In this context we
explore the possibility of direct positron production by annihilation of light
dark matter particles.

the above mentioned five parameters (RFSM5 method) are prescribed. More
specifically, the sum of absolute values or squares of absolute logarithmic
residuals is evaluated on a large number of points making a 5-dimension
hypergrid, through a few iterations. The size is progressively reduced around a
fiducial minimum, and superpositions on nodes of earlier hypergrids are
avoided. An application is made to a sample of 17 SDHs on the scale of cluster
of galaxies, within a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model (Rasia et al. 2004).
In dealing with the mean SDH density profile, a virial radius, averaged over
the whole sample, is assigned, which allows the calculation of the remaining
parameters. Using a RFSM5 method provides a better fit with respect to other
methods. No evident correlation is found between SDH dynamical state (relaxed
or merging) and asymptotic inner slope of the logarithmic density profile or
(for SDH comparable virial masses) scaled radius. Mean values and standard
deviations of some parameters are calculated, and a comparison with previous
results is made with regard to the scaled radius. A certain degree of
degeneracy is found in fitting GPL to SDH density profiles. If it is intrinsic
to the RFSM5 method or it could be reduced by the next generation of
high-resolution simulations, still remains an open question.

confirm the clear dichotomy between O- and B-type stars. The cut-off line
between the two behaviours occurs at $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$

results might be biased by detection limits. Finally we investigate the X-ray
variability of the detected sources and we find that about 40% of the X-ray
emitters in the field of view present consistent signs of variability in the
EPIC instruments. This fraction is much larger than previously thought. About
one third of the early-type stars population, either singles or binaries,

  Symposium, in press",,"10.1007/s11207-005-4977-7",,"astro-ph physics.pop-ph physics.space-ph",,"  Recent studies of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) have detected
interesting, systematic hemispherical and longitudinal asymmetries which have a
profound significance for the understanding of solar magnetic fields. The in
situ HMF measurements since 1960s show that the heliospheric current sheet
(HCS) is systematically shifted (coned) southward during solar minimum times,
leading to the concept of a bashful ballerina. While temporary shifts can be
considerably larger, the average HCS shift (coning) angle is a few degrees,
less than the $7.2^{\circ}$ tilt of the solar rotation axis. Recent solar
observations during the last two solar cycles verify these results and show
that the magnetic areas in the northern solar hemisphere are larger and their
intensity weaker than in the south during long intervals in the late declining
to minimum phase. The multipole expansion reveals a strong quadrupole term
which is oppositely directed to the dipole term. These results imply that the
Sun has a symmetric quadrupole S0 dynamo mode that oscillates in phase with the
dominant dipole A0 mode. Moreover, the heliospheric magnetic field has a strong
tendency to produce solar tilts that are roughly opposite in longitudinal
phase. This implies is a systematic longitudinal asymmetry and leads to a
""flip-flop"" type behaviour in the dominant HMF sector whose period is about 3.2
years. This agrees very well with the similar flip-flop period found recently
in sunspots, as well as with the observed ratio of three between the activity
cycle period and the flip-flop period of sun-like stars. Accordingly, these
results require that the solar dynamo includes three modes, A0, S0 and a
non-axisymmetric mode. Obviously, these results have a great impact on solar
modelling.

  Reanalysis of Geomagnetic Activity","10 pages, 4 figures, Solar Physics, Topical Issue of Space Climate
  Symposium, in print",,"10.1007/s11207-005-4981-y",,"astro-ph physics.geo-ph physics.space-ph",,"  Long-term geomagnetic activity presented by the aa index has been used to
show that the heliospheric magnetic field has more than doubled during the last
100 years. However, serious concern has been raised on the long-term
consistency of the aa index and on the centennial rise of the solar magnetic
field. Here we reanalyze geomagnetic activity during the last 100 years by
calculating the recently suggested IHV (Inter-Hour Variability) index as a
measure of local geomagnetic activity for seven stations. We find that local
geomagnetic activity at all stations follows the same qualitative long-term
pattern: an increase from early 1900s to 1960, a dramatic dropout in 1960s and
a (mostly weaker) increase thereafter. Moreover, at all stations, the activity
at the end of the 20th century has a higher average level than at the beginning
of the century. This agrees with the result based on the aa index that global
geomagnetic activity, and thereby, the open solar magnetic field has indeed
increased during the last 100 years. However, quantitatively, the estimated
centennial increase varies greatly from one station to another. We find that
the relative increase is higher at the high-latitude stations and lower at the
low and mid-latitude stations. These differences may indicate that the fraction
of solar wind disturbances leading to only moderate geomagnetic activity has
increased during the studied time interval. We also show that the IHV index
needs to be corrected for the long-term change of the daily curve, and
calculate the corrected IHV values. Most dramatically, we find the centennial
increase in global geomagnetic activity was considerably smaller, only about
one half of that depicted by the aa index.

superheavy dark matter scenario is embedded in supergravity models with gravity
mediated SUSY breaking, the gravitino bound will squeeze this scenario.
Furthermore, the CMB constraint strengthens the statement that gravitationally
produced superheavy dark matter scenario prefers a relatively large tensor mode
amplitude if the reheating temperature must be less than 10^9 GeV.

particularly suited for such a procedure is the absence of significant

first bright knot, guaranteeing that most of the electrons in the bridge are
cold, and leaving the BC scattered CMB radiation as the only significant source
of photons in this region. At lambda=3.6-8.0 microns, the most likely band for
the BC scattered emission to appear, the angular resolution of Spitzer (~ 1''-

turbulent flow collapse and form stars. Their mass distribution can be derived
analytically from the power spectrum of the turbulent flow and the isothermal

\beta=1.74, consistent with Larson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well
as with new numerical and analytic results on supersonic turbulence, we obtain
a power law mass distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to
3/(4-\beta)=1.33, consistent with the slope of Salpeter's stellar IMF. Below
one solar mass, the mass distribution flattens and turns around at a fraction
of a solar mass, as observed for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar
clusters, because only the densest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass
distribution at low masses is determined by the Log--Normal distribution of the
gas density. The intermittent nature of this distribution is responsible for
the generation of a significant number of collapsing cores of brown dwarf mass.

because the strongly interacting fluid of neutrinos and scalars does not

here the possibility of finding a signature for event horizons in the

objects (COs) into the supermassive ($\sim 10^6 M_\odot$) objects that lie at
the center of most galaxies. Such inspirals will be a major source for LISA,
the future space-based GW observatory. We contrast supermassive black holes
with models in which the central object is a supermassive boson star (SMBS).
Provided the COs interact only gravitationally with the SMBS, stable orbits
exist not just outside the Schwarzschild radius but also inside the surface of
the SMBS as well. The absence of an event horizon allows GWs from these orbits
to be observed. Here we solve for the metric in the interior of a fairly
generic class of SMBS and evolve the trajectory of an inspiraling CO from the
Schwarzschild exterior through the plunge into the exotic SMBS interior. We
calculate the approximate waveforms for GWs emitted during this inspiral.
Geodesics within the SMBS surface will exhibit extreme pericenter precession
and other features making the emitted GWs readily distinguishable from those
emitted during an inspiral into a black hole.

star-forming environments within 1 kpc of the Sun. In order to probe the
universality of the IMF over a wider range of parameter space (metalicity,
ambient pressure, magnetic field strength) new techniques are required. We
begin by summarizing our approach to deriving the sub-stellar IMF down to the
opacity-limit for fragmentation using NGC 1333 as an example. Next, we describe
results from simulations using the observed point-spread function of the new
6.5m MMT adaptive optics system and examine the confusion-limited sensitivity
to low mass stars in rich star-forming clusters out to 0.5 Mpc. We also present
preliminary results from observations with this system of the W51 star-forming
complex. Finally, we outline a new technique to estimate the ratio of high to
low mass stars in unresolved stellar populations, such as the massive star
clusters observed in interacting galaxies (e.g. Mengel et al. 2002). While
evidence for variations in the IMF remains inconclusive, new studies are
required to rule them out and determine whether or not the IMF is universal
over the range of parameter space relevant to star-forming galaxies over cosmic
time.

collapse into BD mass objects with circumstellar disks, like more massive
protostars. We rely on numerical experiments with very large resolution,

evolutionary stages. However there are indications that the very brightest
systems may be difficult to explain this way. Accordingly we consider the class
of hyperluminous X-ray sources (HLXs) (i.e. those with apparent bolometric
luminosities >~10^41 erg/s). Because this class is small (currently only the
M82 object is a secure member) we do not need to invoke a new formation
mechanism for its black holes. We explore instead the idea that HLXs may be the
nuclei of satellite galaxies captured during hierarchical merging. The observed
correlation between AGN and tidal interactions implies that HLX activity would
switch on during passage through the host galaxy, close to pericentre. This
suggests that HLXs should appear near the host galaxy, be associated with star
formation, and thus possibly with ULXs.

mass models are studied. These models are constructed by adding the additional
radial functions, each multiplied by a low-order spherical harmonic, to the
models of \citet{ct00}. The projected surface density of mass models can be
calculated analytically which allows us to derive the analytic expressions of
axial ratio and position angles of major axis of constant density elliptical
contours at asymptotic radii. The models are more general than those studied
earlier in the sense that the inclusions of additional terms in density
distribution, allows one to produce varieties of the radial profile of axial
ratio and position angle, in particular, their small scale variations at inner
radii. Strong correlations are found to exist between the observed axial ratio
evaluated at $0.25 R_{e}$ and at $4 R_{e}$ which occupy well-separated regions
in the parameter space for different choices of the intrinsic axial ratios.
These correlations can be exploited to predict the intrinsic shape of the mass
model, independent of the viewing angles. Using Bayesian statistics, the result
of a test case launched for an estimation of the shape of a model galaxy is
found to be satisfactory.

thermodynamics was the description of steam engines, i.e. boiling water. Its
essential physics is the separation of the gas phase from the liquid. Of
course, boiling water is inhomogeneous and as such cannot be treated by
canonical thermo-statistics. Then it is not astonishing, that a phase
transition of first order is signaled canonically by a Yang-Lee singularity.
Thus it is only treated correctly by microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck
statistics. This is elaborated in the present article. It turns out that the
Boltzmann-Planck statistics is much richer and gives fundamental insight into
statistical mechanics and especially into entropy. This can even be done to
some extend rigorously and analytically. The microcanonical entropy has a very
simple physical meaning: It measures the microscopic uncertainty that we have
about the system, i.e. the number of points in $6N$-dim phase, which are
consistent with our information about the system. It can rigorously be split
into an ideal-gas part and a configuration part which contains all the physics
and especially is responsible for all phase transitions. The deep and essential
difference between ``extensive'' and ``intensive'' control parameters, i.e.
microcanonical and canonical statistics, is exemplified by rotating,
self-gravitating systems.

known for over 100 years, yet this discreteness has not been directly observed
so far. Almost all current measurements involve measuring the voltage drop
across a resistor, using Ohm's law, in which the discrete nature of charge does
not come into play. However, by sending a direct current through a
microelectronic circuit with a chain of islands connected by small tunnel
junctions, the individual electrons can be observed one by one. The quantum
mechanical tunnelling of single charges in this one-dimensional array is time
correlated, and consequently the detected signal has the average frequency
f=I/e, where I is the current and e is the electron charge. Here we report a
direct observation of these time-correlated single-electron tunnelling
oscillations, and show electron counting in the range 5 fA-1 pA. This
represents a fundamentally new way to measure extremely small currents, without
offset or drift. Moreover, our current measurement, which is based on electron
counting, is self-calibrated, as the measured frequency is related to the
current only by a natural constant.

generators is the main incentive behind the effort to develop superconducting
armature windings based on coated conductors in the form of wide tapes with
large aspect ratio. The main obstacle to the application of coated
superconductors in stator windings is the large losses incurred due to the ac
magnetic field produced by the rotor's dc coils of the field windings. In the
range of frequencies typical for aircraft generators, the hysteretic losses in
wide tapes are unacceptably high. They can be reduced by dividing the
superconducting layer into multiple filaments separated by non-superconducting
barriers. However, the lack of current sharing between the filaments makes the
conductor vulnerable to the localized defects, so that a single blockage can
impede the flow of transport current through the whole length of a given
filament. We present estimates of reliability as well as the magnetization
losses in multiply connected superconductors. In this type of superconducting
tape, a sparse network of superconducting bridges, which allows for current
sharing, connects the filaments. The trade-off between the different types of
losses and the connectivity requirement imposes restrictions on the number of
filaments and properties of the network of bridges.

naturally explain both the average linear T_1(E_J) dependence and the irregular

We argue that understanding these edge states provides a pathway to generic
comprehension of surface states in many semi-infinite physical systems. It is
shown that the edge states occur within the gaps of the corresponding bulk
spectrum (thus also called the midgap states). More importantly, we show that
the presence of these midgap states reflects an underlying generalized
supersymmetry. This supersymmetric structure is a generalized rotational
symmetry among sublattices and results in a universal tendency: all midgap
states tend to vanish with periods commensurate with the underlying lattice.
Based on our formulation, we propose a structure with superlattice in hopping
to control the number of localized electronic states occurring at the ends of
the nanowires. Other implications are also discussed. In particular, it is
shown that the ordinarily recognized impurity states can be viewed as disguised
midgap states.

The origin of their magnetic properties has been investigated emphasizing the
role of the Mn sublattice. The significant influence of the Mn-Mn and Mn-$X$
interatomic distances on the Mn magnetic moment value is delineated from our
computations, supporting many neutron diffraction data. We show that the marked
change of $\mu_{Mn}$ with the Mn-Mn and Mn-$X$ distances resulted from a
redistribution between spin-up and spin-down $d$-Mn DOS rather than from
different fillings of the Mn 3$d$-shell. Bearing in mind that the neutron
diffraction data reported for the $R$Mn$X$ compounds are rather scattered, the
KKR computations of $\mu_{Mn}$ are in fair agreement with the experimental
values. Comparing density of states near $E_{F}$ obtained in different magnetic
orderings, one can notice that the entitled $R$Mn$X$ systems seem to 'adapt'
their magnetic structures to minimize the DOS in the vicinity of the Fermi
level. Noteworthy, the SrMnGe antiferromagnet exhibits a pseudo-gap behaviour

the F-AF transition occurring in the disordered La$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$MnSi alloy for

consequence it can be used for studying dynamical behavior of semiconductor
lasers and amplifiers. However, many authors use non-entirely correct ways for
the application of the method. In this paper the versatile model is proposed
for the investigation, optimization, and the control of parameters of the
semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers which may be employed for the
creation of new generations of the high-density photonic systems for the
information processing and data transfer, follower and security arrangements.
The model is based on the coupled Schredinger, Poisson and drift-diffusion
equations which allow to determine energy quantization levels and wave
functions of charge carriers, take into account built-in fields, and to
investigate doped MQW structures and those under external electric fields
influence. In the paper the methodology of computer realization based on our
model is described. Boundary conditions for each equation and consideration of
the convergence for the method are included. Frequently encountered in practice
approaches and errors of self-consistent computations are described. Domains of
applicability of the main approaches are estimated. Application examples of the
method are given. Some of regularities of the results which were discovered by
using self-consistent method are discussed. Design recommendations for
structure optimization in respect to managing some parameters of AMQW
structures are given.

  coupled to a heat bath: Application to nonadiabatic transitions","26 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Quantum information processing has greatly increased interest in the
phenomenon of environmentally-induced decoherence. The spin boson model is
widely used to study the interaction between a spin-modelling a quantum
particle moving in a double well potential-and its environment-modelled by a
heat bath of harmonic oscillators. This paper extends a previous analysis of
the static spin boson study to the driven spin boson case, with the derivation
of an exact integro-differential equation for the time evolution of the
propagator of the reduced spin density matrix. This is the first main result.
By specializing to weak damping we then obtain the next result, a set of
Bloch-Redfield equations for the equilibrium fixed spin initial condition.
Finally we show that these equations can be used to solve the classic
dissipative Landau-Zener problem and illustrate these solutions for the weak
damping case. The effect of dissipation is seen to be minimised as the speed of
passage is increased, implying that qubits need to be switched as fast as
possible.

author and was applied to the investigation of the evolution of cosmological
perturbations on superhorizon scales in the case that the scalar fields have
incommensurable masses. In the present paper, the analysis is extended to the
case that the masses of the scalar fields satisfy resonance relations
approximately. In this case, the action-angle variables for the system can be
classified into fast changing variables and slowly changing variables. We show
that after an appropriate canonical transformation, the part of the Hamiltonian
that depends on fast changing angle variables can be made negligibley small, so
that the dynamics of the system can be effectively determined by a truncated
Hamiltonian that describes a closed dynamics of the slowly changing varables.
Utilizing this formulation, we show that the system is unstable if this
truncated Hamiltonian system has hyperbolic fixed point and as a consequence,
the Bardeen parameter for a perturbation of the system grows.

consequence of the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity.
Most of the studies that point to this result are nonetheless based on
perturbative quantization approaches, in which the effect of matter on the
geometry is regarded as a correction to a classical background. In this paper,
we consider rainbow spacetimes constructed from doubly special relativity by
using a modification of the proposals of Magueijo and Smolin. In these models,
gravitational effects are incorporated (at least to a certain extent) in the
definition of the energy-momentum of particles without adhering to a
perturbative treatment of the back reaction. In this context, we derive and
compare the expressions of the time uncertainty in quantizations that use as
evolution parameter either the background or the rainbow time coordinates.
These two possibilities can be regarded as corresponding to perturbative and

degenerate flavors) using chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). We work to
next-to-leading order (NLO) in a power counting scheme in which m_q ~ a

argue that automatic O(a) improvement of physical quantities at maximal twist,
which has been demonstrated in general if m_q >> a \Lambda_QCD^2, holds even if
m_q ~ a \Lambda_QCD^2, as long as one uses an appropriate non-perturbative
definition of the twist angle. We demonstrate this with explicit calculations,
for arbitrary twist angle, of all pionic quantities that involve no more than a
single pion in the initial and final states: masses, decay constants, form
factors and condensates, as well as the differences between alternate
definitions of twist angle. We also calculate the axial and pseudoscalar form
factors of the pion, quantities which violate flavor and parity, and which
vanish in the continuum limit. These are of interest because they are not
automatically O(a) improved at maximal twist. They allow a determination of the
unknown low energy constants introduced by discretization errors, and provide
tests of the accuracy of ChPT at NLO. We extend our results into the regime
where m_q ~ a^2 \Lambda_QCD^3, and argue in favor of a recent proposal that
automatic O(a) improvement at maximal twist remains valid in this regime.

supersymmetry. We illustrate the present-day and possible future ILC
sensitivities within the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model (CMSSM), in which there are three independent soft
supersymmetry-breaking parameters m_{1/2}, m_0 and A_0. We analyze the present
and future sensitivities separately for M_W, sin^2(theta_eff), (g-2)_mu, BR(b
-> s gamma), BR(B_s -> mu+ mu-), M_h and Higgs branching ratios. We display the
observables as functions of m_{1/2}, fixing m_0 so as to obtain the cold dark
matter density allowed by WMAP and other cosmological data for specific values
of A_0, tan beta and mu > 0. In a second step, we investigate the combined
sensitivity of the currently available precision observables, M_W,
sin^2(theta_eff), (g-2)_mu and BR(b -> s gamma), by performing a chi^2
analysis. The current data are in very good agreement with the CMSSM prediction
for tan beta = 10, with a clear preference for relatively small values of
m_{1/2} \sim 300 GeV. In this case, there would be good prospects for observing
supersymmetry directly at both the LHC and the ILC, and some chance already at
the Tevatron collider. For tan beta = 50, the quality of the fit is worse, and
somewhat larger m_{1/2} values are favoured. With the prospective ILC
accuracies the sensitivity to indirect effects of supersymmetry greatly
improves. This may provide indirect access to supersymmetry even at scales
beyond the direct reach of the LHC or the ILC.

of a normal spectrum, and |V_{e3}|^2 >8 10^{-4} in the case of an inverted

as a function of redshift in a model independent way, then we consider two
specific models where the neutrino mass varies during the evolution of the
Quintessence fields. Our calculations show in general the value of the time
delay is changed substantially relative to a constant neutrino mass.
Furthermore our numerical results show that the flight time delay in these

opens a possibility of testing the scenario of mass varying neutrino with the

of the system at regular time intervals while it evolves and determine the

on the type of dynamics, but also on the type of observations. Intuitively, one
can expect that some measurements are better suited than others to reveal
information about the dynamics, whereas many will generate undesirable noise.
In this paper, we show for two widely used model systems that the dynamical
entropy is rather robust in this respect. More precisely, general local
positive operator-valued measurements may be restricted to von Neumann type
measurements for the shift on a quantum spin chain and gauge-invariant ones for
the shift on a Fermion chain.

is central to the appearance of a constituent-quark mass-scale and an
existential prerequisite for Goldstone modes. Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSEs)
studies have long emphasised this importance, and have proved that QCD's
Goldstone modes are the only pseudoscalar mesons to possess a nonzero leptonic
decay constant in the chiral limit when chiral symmetry is dynamically broken,
while the decay constants of their radial excitations vanish. Such features are
readily illustrated using a rainbow-ladder truncation of the DSEs. In this
connection we find (in GeV): f_{eta_c(1S)}= 0.233, m_{eta_c(2S)}=3.42; and
support for interpreting eta(1295), eta(1470) as the first radial excitations
of eta(548), eta'(958), respectively, and K(1460) as the first radial
excitation of the kaon. Moreover, such radial excitations have electromagnetic
diameters greater than 2fm. This exceeds the spatial length of lattices used

of the formation of an isolated luminous mass in the sky and the moderate

depicting ball lightning as a vortex. We explore the solutions of this equation

series occur as a strong magnetic storm approaches. These alterations reveal a
gradual reduction of complexity as the catastrophic event approaches. The
increase of the susceptibility coupled with the transition from anti-persistent
to persistent behavior may indicate that the onset of a severe magnetic storm
is imminent. The preparation of a major magnetic storm could be studied in
terms of ""Intermittent Criticality"". The analysis also suggests that the
continuous scale invariance is partially broken into a discrete scale
invariance symmetry.

energy-resolution neutron backscattering study to investigate slow motions on
nanosecond time scales in highly oriented solid supported phospholipid bilayers
of the model system DMPC -d54 (deuterated
1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine). This technique allows
discriminating the Q-dependent onset of mobility and provides a benchmark test
regarding the feasibility of dynamical neutron scattering investigations on
these sample systems. Apart from freezing of the lipid acyl-chains, we could
observe a second freezing temperature that we attribute to the hydration water
in between the membrane stacks. The freezing is lowered several degrees as
compared to (heavy) bulk water.

of stabilizer states, such that every two LU equivalent states in this class
are necessarily LC equivalent. Together with earlier results, this shows that
LC, LU and SLOCC equivalence are the same notions for this class of stabilizer
states. Moreover, recognizing whether two given stabilizer states in the
present subclass are locally equivalent only requires a polynomial number of
operations in the number of qubits.

is well known that quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve the identity
operator (which we refer to as unital) are strictly purity-decreasing
transformations. Here we provide an almost complete characterization of the
class of strictly purity-decreasing quantum dynamical semigroups. We show that
in the case of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces a dynamical semigroup is
strictly purity-decreasing if and only if it is unital, while in the infinite
dimensional case, unitality is only sufficient.
