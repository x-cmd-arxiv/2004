corona is to do statistics of properties of events (or structures), associated
with flares, that can be found in observations or in numerical simulations.
Numerous papers have followed such a methodology, using different definitions
of an event, but the reasons behind the choice of a particular definition (and
not another one) is very rarely discussed. We give here a comprehensive set of
possible event definitions starting from a one-dimensional data set such as a
time-series of energy dissipation. Each definition is then applied to a
time-series of energy dissipation issued from simulations of a shell-model of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence as defined in Giuliani and Carbone (1998), or
from a new model of coupled shell-models designed to represent a magnetic loop
in the solar corona. We obtain distributions of the peak dissipation power,
total energy, duration and waiting-time associated to each definition. These
distributions are then investigated and compared, and the influence of the
definition of an event on statistics is discussed. In particular, power-law
distributions are more likely to appear when using a threshold. The sensitivity
of the distributions to the definition of an event seems also to be weaker for
events found in a highly intermittent time series. Some implications on
statistical results obtained from observations are discussed.

  Significant fluctuations in sky brightness were also detected which can not
be explained by fluctuations due to faint stars, zodiacal components and normal
galaxies. The excess fluctuation amounts to ~ 1/4 of the excess emission over
the integrated light of galaxies. A two-point correlation analysis shows that

  Recent WMAP results of CMB polarization indicate that the reionization of the

light could be redshifted UV light from the first generation of massive stars
(Pop.III stars) which caused the reionization of the Universe. The spectral
jump around 1 micron over the optical EBL suggests that massive star formation
terminated at z~9. The observed fluctuations, however, are considerably larger

the remaining set of class B models. Following the procedure of paper I we find
all SH models of class B subjected only to the minimal geometric assumption to
admit a proper Homothetic Vector Field (HVF). The physical implications of the
obtained geometric results are studied by specialising our considerations to
the case of vacuum and $\gamma -$law perfect fluid models. As a result we
regain all the known exact solutions regarding vacuum and non-tilted perfect
fluid models. In the case of tilted fluids we find the \emph{general
}self-similar solution for the exceptional type VI$_{-1/9}$ model and we
identify it as equilibrium point in the corresponding dynamical state space. It
is found that this \emph{new} exact solution belongs to the subclass of models
$n_\alpha ^\alpha =0$, is defined for $\gamma \in (\frac 43,\frac 32)$ and
although has a five dimensional stable manifold there exist always two unstable
modes in the restricted state space. Furthermore the analysis of the remaining
types, guarantees that tilted perfect fluid models of types III, IV, V and
VII$_h$ cannot admit a proper HVF strongly suggesting that these models either
may not be asymptotically self-similar (type V) or may be extreme tilted at
late times. Finally for each Bianchi type, we give the extreme tilted

momentum the semiclassical (WKB) approximation is valid. A physical content of
the semiclassical approximation is that the quantum fluctuations effects are
suppressed and vanish asymptotically. The chiral as well as $U(1)_A$ breakings
in QCD result from quantum fluctuations. Hence these breakings must be
suppressed high in the spectrum and the spectrum of high-lying hadrons must
exhibit $U(2)_L \times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian. This
argument can be made stronger for mesons in the large $N_c$ limit. In this
limit all mesons are stable against strong decays and the spectrum is infinite.
Hence, one can excite mesons of arbitrary large size with arbitrary large
action, in which case the semiclassical limit is manifest. Actually we do not
need the exact $N_c=\infty$ limit. For any large action there always exist such
$N_c$ that the isolated mesons with such an action do exist and can be
described semiclassically. From the empirical fact that we observe multiplets
of chiral and $U(1)_A$ groups high in the hadron spectrum it follows that
$N_c=3$ is large enough for this purpose.

characteristics of the tensor correlation, which is represented by an admixture
of the $0s_{1/2}$ configuration with a spatially modified $0p_{1/2}$ orbit. For
$^5$He, we solve a coupled OCM equation for an extended $^4$He+$n$ model, while
taking into account the tensor correlation in the $^4$He cluster. It is shown
that the tensor correlation produces the Pauli blocking, in particular, for the
$J^\pi={1/2}^-$ state, and its effect causes about half of the p-wave doublet
splitting in $^5$He. This indicates that the strength of the effective
spin-orbit interaction should be reduced by about half from the conventional
one. We obtain a reliable $^4$He-$n$ interaction, including the tensor
correlation, which further improves the behavior of the $d$- and $f$-wave phase
shifts in the $^4$He+$n$ system.

respect to the plasma potential is affecting the plasma states in the toroidal
geometry of the Blaamann device in Tromso. In the experiments discussed here, a
ring with smaller diameter than the limiter was centered inside the bulk of the
plasma and its bias varied with respect to the plasma potential. In the
electron saturation current regime of the ring, a significant reduction of the
fluctuation levels was observed, and a shear in the poloidal velocity occurred
at the low-field side of the ring. This shear was positioned at the same radial
position as the maximum of the radial transport when the ring was left floating
or biased in the ion saturation current regime. For the latter ring biases, the
poloidal velocities had no shear on the low-field side of the ring. Without the
velocity shear, the radial transport was similar to previous experiments
without ring. With the velocity shear, the radial transport was destroyed. This
plasma state, with very low radial transport and fluctuation levels as well as
plasma densities around 1017 m-3, is believed to provide a suitable plasma for
wave propagation studies in a magnetized plasma with curved magnetic field

analysis using Hurst exponent estimators proved to be inconclusive. Subsequent
analysis using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed a crossover in the
scaling exponent ($\alpha$). At short time scales, a scaling exponent of
$\alpha \sim 1.4$ indicated that the data resembled Brownian noise, whereas for
larger time scales the data exhibited long range correlations ($\alpha \sim
