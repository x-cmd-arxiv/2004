AIRES to make the calculation for two different primary spectra and under
several approximations to the propagation of charged particles in the

of the geomagnetic field effects. We propose a high and a low fit of the proton

Comparison with measurements of the muon flux by the CAPRICE experiment shows a
slight preference for the higher primary cosmic ray flux parametrization.

parameter for characterising the halo masses from both observational and
theoretical results: \dML, the logarithmic radial gradient of the mass-to-light
ratio. Using halo density profiles from LCDM simulations, we derive predictions
for this gradient for various galaxy luminosities and star formation
efficiencies $\epsilon_{SF}$. As a pilot study, we assemble the available \dML\
data from kinematics in early-type galaxies - representing the first unbiassed
study of halo masses in a wide range of early-type galaxy luminosities - and
find a correlation between luminosity and \dML, such that the brightest
galaxies appear the most dark-matter dominated. We find that the gradients in
most of the brightest galaxies may fit in well with the LCDM predictions, but
that there is also a population of fainter galaxies whose gradients are so low
as to imply an unreasonably high star formation efficiency $\epsilon_{SF} > 1$.
This difficulty is eased if dark haloes are not assumed to have the standard
LCDM profiles, but lower central concentrations.

jump) at the southeast and a long tail (at least 60 kpc from the nucleus) at
the northwest of the galaxy are detected, as expected if the galaxy is moving
to the southeast. The X-ray edge, at the midway of the nucleus and the
southeast optical disk edge, is also at the same position where the Halpha

No extraplanar X-ray component is detected, probably due to the combining
effects of weaker outflow activity than that in nuclear starbursts, and
external confinement plus stripping. The diffuse thermal gas in UGC 6697 has a

the study of the non-linear evolution of white dwarf oscillations excited via

Consequently, we require long term stability, low diffusivity, and high
algorithmic efficiency. An explicit, Eulerian, finite-difference scheme on a
regular Cartesian grid fulfills these requirements. It provides uniform
resolution throughout the flow, as well as simplifying the computation of the
self-gravitational potential, which is done via spectral methods. In this
paper, we describe the numerical scheme and present the results of some
diagnostic problems. We also demonstrate the stability of a cold white dwarf in
three dimensions over hundreds of dynamical times. Finally, we compare the
results of the numerical scheme to the linear theory of adiabatic oscillations,
finding numerical quality factors on the order of 6000, and excellent agreement
with the oscillation frequency obtained by the linear analysis.

companions. All of the stars observed at the CFHT show long-term (months to
years) changes in H & K intensity levels. Four stars display short-term (days)
cyclical activity. For two, HD 73256 and kappa^1 Ceti, the activity is likely
associated with an active region rotating with the star, however, the flaring
in excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with a hot jupiter. A
planetary companion remains a possibility for kappa^1 Ceti. For the other two,
HD 179949 and upsilon And, the cyclic variation is synchronized to the hot

seen in two out of three epochs. The effect is only marginal in the third epoch
at which the seasonal level of chromospheric activity had changed for both

K-line reversal intensities for the sample of 13 stars. Also, a suggestive
correlation exists between this activity and the M_p sin(i) of the star's hot
jupiter. Because of their small separation (<= 0.1 AU), many of the hot
jupiters lie within the Alfv\'en radius of their host stars which allows a
direct magnetic interaction with the stellar surface. We discuss the conditions
under which a planet's magnetic field might induce activity on the stellar

underlying supernova remnant, after the radiative transition, while the
remnants of GRBs occurring in the hot, low-density medium produced by recurrent
starbursts in the CMZ become subsonic before they can form a radiative shell,
allowing the positrons to escape and fill the whole Galactic bulge. If the mean

transverse oscillations in coronal loops, triggered by nearby flare events, are
often measured in EUV lines and are generally interpreted as standing kink
modes. However, the damping times of these oscillations are typically very
short (from one to a few periods) and the physical mechanism responsible for
the decay is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the majority of the observed
cases actually appears to be better modeled by propagating, rather than
standing, modes. Here we perform 2.5-D compressible MHD simulations of
impulsively generated Alfven waves propagating in a potential magnetic arcade
(assumed as a simplified 2-D loop model), taking into account the
stratification of the solar atmosphere with height from the photosphere to the
corona. The results show a strong spreading of the initially localized pulses
along the loop, due to the variations in the Alfven velocity with height, and
correspondingly an efficient damping of the amplitude of the oscillations. We
believe that simple explanations based on the effects of wave propagation in
highly inhomogeneous media may apply to the majority of the reported cases, and
that variations of the background density and Alfven speed along the loop
should be considered as key ingredients in future models.

``Synthetic Field Method'' (SFM), and applied this concept to a HST/WFPC2 image

necessity of assumptions about the distribution of absorbers or the disk light.
The poor statistics, however, result in a large error in individual
measurements. We report on improvements to and automation of the Synthetic
Field Method which render it suitable for application to large archival
datasets. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this new method, the
results on NGC 1365, a SBb, and NGC 4536, a SABbc, are presented. The
extinction estimate for NGC1365 is A_I = 0.6 (+0.6/-0.7) at 0.45 R_25 and for
NGC4536 it is A_I = 1.6 (+1.0/-1.3) at 0.75 R_25. The results for NGC4536 are
compared with those of Gonzalez et al. (1998). The automation is found to limit
the maximum depth to which field galaxies can be found. Taking this into
account, our results agree with those of Gonzalez et al. (1998). We conclude
that this method can only give an inaccurate measure of extinction for a field
covering a small solid angle. An improved measurement of disk extinction can be
done by averaging the results over a series of HST fields, thereby improving
the statistics. This can be achieved with the automated method, trading some
completeness limit for speed. The results from this set of fields are reported
in a companion paper Holwerda et al. (2005b).

Nonequilibrium systems may violate this rule and several models, where phase
coexistence occurs over a finite (n-dimensional) region of the parameter space,
have been reported. The first example of this behaviour was found in Toom's
model [Toom,Geoff,GG], that exhibits generic bistability, i.e. two-phase
coexistence over a finite region of its two-dimensional parameter space (see
Section 1). In addition to its interest as a genuine nonequilibrium property,
generic multistability, defined as a generalization of bistability, is both of

to argue that some complex structures appearing in nature could be truly stable

vorticity distribution accelerates intense vortices (clumps) to merge each
other and to array in the symmetric pattern which is called ``vortex
crystals''; they are observed in the experiments on pure electron plasma and
the simulations of Euler fluid. Vortex merger is thought to be a result of
negative ``temperature'' introduced by L. Onsager. Slight difference in the
initial distribution from this leads to ``vortex crystals''. We study these
phenomena by examining N-point vortex systems governed by the Hamilton
equations of motion. First, we study a three-point vortex system without
background distribution. It is known that a N-point vortex system with boundary
exhibits chaotic behavior for N\geq 3. In order to investigate the properties
of the phase space structure of this three-point vortex system with circular
boundary, we examine the Poincar\'e plot of this system. Then we show that
topology of the Poincar\'e plot of this system drastically changes when the
parameters, which are concerned with the sign of ``temperature'', are varied.
Next, we introduce a formula for energy spectrum of a N-point vortex system
with circular boundary. Further, carrying out numerical computation, we
reproduce a vortex crystal and a vortex merger in a few hundred point vortices
system. We confirm that the energy of vortices is transferred from the clumps
to the background in the course of vortex crystallization. In the vortex
merging process, we numerically calculate the energy spectrum introduced above
and confirm that it behaves as k^{-\alpha},(\alpha\approx 2.2-2.8) at the
region 10^0<k<10^1 after the merging.

its basic blocks is crucial, since loading basic blocks that are unlikely to be
executed first places them high in the instruction-memory hierarchy only to be
dislodged as the execution goes on. In this paper we study the use of Bayesian
networks as models of the input history of a program. The main point is the
creation of a probabilistic model that persists as the program is run on
different inputs and at each new input refines its own parameters in order to
reflect the program's input history more accurately. As the model is thus
tuned, it causes basic blocks to be reordered so that, upon arrival of the next
input for execution, loading the basic blocks into memory automatically takes
into account the input history of the program. We report on extensive
experiments, whose results demonstrate the efficacy of the overall approach in
progressively lowering the execution times of a program on identical inputs
placed randomly in a sequence of varied inputs. We provide results on selected

  Publishers, INC. N.Y., 2005. ISBN: 1-59454-521-9",,"UMSNH-Phys/0402","hep-ph",,"  Gauge theories have been a cornerstone of the description of the world at the
level of the fundamental particles. The Lagrangian or the action describing the
corresponding interactions is invariant under certain gauge transformations.
This symmetry is reflected in terms of the Ward-Green-Takahashi (or the
Slavnov-Taylor) identities which relate various Green functions among each
other, and the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations which relate a Green
function in a particular gauge to it in an arbitrary covariant one. As an
outcome, all physical observables should be independent of the choice of the
covariant gauge parameter. The most systematic scheme to solve quantum field
theories (QFT) is perturbation theory where the above-mentioned identities are
satisfied at every order of approximation. This feature is exploited highly
usefully as a verification of the results obtained after time- and
effort-consuming exercises. As it stands, not all natural phenomena are
realized in the perturbative regime of QFTs. Therefore, one is inevitably led
to make efforts to solve these theories in a non perturbative fashion. A
natural starting point for such studies in the continuum are the
Schwinger-Dyson Equations (SDE). One of the most undesirable features
associated with their non perturbative truncation is the loss of highly and
rightly esteemed gauge invariance rendering the predictions less reliable.
Arguably, the only hope we have to recuperate the credibility of the results is
to employ only such truncation schemes which yield predictions that match onto
the blindly reliable perturbative ones at every order of approximation. It is a
highly difficult task but not impossible.

viscosity, we suggest that this energy/momentum propagate as a collective

known, e.g. the so called sonic booms from supersonic planes. We solve the
linearized relativistic hydrodynamic equations to detail the flow picture. We
argue that for RHIC collisions the direction of this flow should make a cone at
a specific large angle with the jet, of about $70^o$, and thus lead to peaks in
particle correlations at the angle $\Delta\phi=\pi\pm 1.2$ rad relative to the
large-$p_t$ trigger. This angle happens to matchperfectly the position of the
maximum in the angular distribution of secondaries associated with the trigger
recently seen by the STAR and PHENIX collaborations. We also discuss briefly

linearized gauged supergravity. We show that the 1-loop effective Kahler
potential is a simple functional of the KK spectrum in the presence of generic
localized kinetic terms at the two branes. We also present a simple
understanding of our results by showing that the leading matter effects are
equivalent to suitable displacements of the branes. We then apply this general
result to compute the gravity-mediated universal soft mass $m_0^2$ in models
where the visible and the hidden sectors are sequestered at the two branes. We
find that the contributions coming from radion mediation and brane-to-brane
mediation are both negative in the minimal set-up, but the former can become
positive if the gravitational kinetic term localized at the hidden brane has a
sizeable coefficient. We then compare the features of the two extreme cases of
flat and very warped geometry, and give an outlook on the building of viable
models.

background (CMB) anisotropy. We do so using the boundary effective action
formalism of hep-th/0401164 which accounts quantitatively for the cosmological
vacuum ambiguity. In this formalism we can clearly 1) delineate the validity of
cosmological effective actions in an expanding universe. The corollary of the
initial state ambiguity is the existence of an earliest time. The inability of
an effective action to describe physics before this time demands that one sets
initial conditions on the earliest time hypersurface. A calculation then shows
that CMB anisotropy measurements are generically sensitive to high energy
corrections to the initial conditions. 2) We compute the one-loop contribution
to the stress-tensor due to high-energy physics corrections to an arbitrary
cosmological initial state. We find that phenomenological bounds on the
backreaction do not lead to strong constraints on the coefficient of the
leading boundary irrelevant operator. Rather, we find that the power spectrum
itself is the quantity most sensitive to initial state corrections. 3) The
computation of the one-loop backreaction confirms arguments that irrelevant
corrections to the Bunch-Davies initial state yield non-adiabatic vacua
characterized by an energy excess at some earlier time. However, this excess
only dominates over the classical background at times before the `earliest
time' at which the effective action is valid. We conclude that the cosmological
effective action with boundaries is a fully self-consistent and quantitative
approach to transplanckian corrections to the CMB.

when branes separation is larger than the string length scale, there are two
minima in the tachyon direction. As branes move toward each other under the
gravitational force, the tachyon tunneling from false to true vacuum may make a
bubble formation followed by a classical evolution of the bubble. On the other
hand, when branes separation is smaller than the string length scale, the
potential shows one maximum and one minimum. In this case, a homogeneous
tachyon rolling in real time makes an attractive potential for the branes
distance. This classical force is speculated to be the effective force between
the two branes.

rapidly for a neutrino factory or muon collider. Muon bunches tend to be large.
Progress in fixed field, alternating gradient (FFAG) lattices to meet this
challenge is reviewed. FFAG magnets are naturally wide; low momentum muons move
from the low field side of a gradient magnet to the high field side as they
gain energy. This can be exploited to do double duty and allow a large beam
admittance without unduly increasing the magnetic field volume. If the amount
of RF must be reduced to optimize cost, an FFAG ring can accommodate extra
orbits. I describe both scaling FFAGs in which the bends in each magnet are
energy independent and non-scaling FFAGs in which the bends in each magnet do
vary with muon energy. In all FFAG designs the sum of the bends in groups of
magnets are constant; otherwise orbits would not close. Ways of keeping the
accelerating beam in phase with the RF are described. Finally, a 1 MeV proof of
principle scaling FFAG has been built at KEK and began accelerating protons in
June 2000 with a 1 kHz repetition rate.

methods, of measurement-induced localization of relational degrees of freedom.
Looking first at the interference of two optical modes, we find that the
localization of the relative phase can be as good for mixed states - in
particular for two initially Poissonian or thermal states - as for the
well-known case of two Fock states. In a realistic setup the localization for
mixed states is robust and experimentally accessible, and we discuss
applications to superselection rules. For an ideal setup and initial Fock
states we show how a relational Schr\""{o}dinger cat state emerges, and
investigate circumstances under which such a state is destroyed. In our second
example we consider the localization of relative atomic phase between two Bose
Einstein condensates, looking particularly at the build up of spatial
interference patterns, an area which has attracted much attention since the
work of Javanainen and Yoo. We show that the relative phase localizes much
faster than was intimated in previous studies focusing on the emerging
interference pattern itself. Finally, we explore the localization of relative
spatial parameters discussed in recent work by Rau, Dunningham and Burnett. We
retain their models of indistinguishable scattering but make different
assumptions. In particular we consider the case of a real distant observer
monitoring light scattering off two particles, who records events only from a
narrow field of view. The localization is only partial regardless of the number
of observations. This paper contributes to the wider debate on relationism in
quantum mechanics, which treats fundamental concepts - reference frames and
conservation laws - from a fully quantum and operational perspective.
