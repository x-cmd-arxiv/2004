and 6 months after the optical outburst. It was not detected in the first
observation, with an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-10 keV
range L(x) < 4.8 x 10^(30) x (d/1 kpc)^2 erg s^(-1) (where d is the distance to
the nova). Five months later, a hard X-ray source with L(x) = (1.4-2.5) x
10^(32) x (d/1 kpc)^2 erg s^(-1) was detected. The X-ray spectrum appears to be
thermal, but we cannot rule out additional components due to unresolved
emission lines. A blackbody component is likely to contribute to the observed
spectrum, but it has bolometric luminosity L$_{\rm bol} = 2.5 x 10^(33) x (d/1
kpc)^2 erg s^(-1), therefore it is not sufficiently luminous to be due to a
central white dwarf which is still burning hydrogen on the surface. An optical
spectrum, taken 5 months post-outburst, indicates no intrinsic reddening of the
ejecta. Therefore, we conclude that the shell had already become optically thin
to supersoft X-rays, but nuclear burning had already turned off, or was in the
process of turning off at this time. We discuss why this implies that recurrent
novae, even the rare ones with long optical decays like IM Nor, indicating a
large envelope mass, are not statistically significant as type Ia SN
candidates.

beta absorption trough of the highest redshift quasar, SDSS J1148+5251. The
emission looks perfectly point-like; there is no evidence for the intervening
galaxy that we previously suggested might be contaminating the quasar spectrum.
We derive a more accurate astrometric position for the quasar in the two
filters and see no indication of gravitational lensing. We conclude that the
light in the Ly beta trough is leaking through two unusually transparent,
overlapping windows in the IGM absorption, one in the Ly beta forest at z ~ 6
and one in the Ly alpha forest at z ~ 5.
  If there are significant optical depth variations on velocity scales small
compared with our spectral resolution (~150 km/s), the Ly alpha trough becomes
more transparent for a given Ly beta optical depth. Such variations can only
strengthen our conclusion that the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM
increases dramatically at z>6. We argue that the transmission in the Ly beta
trough is not only a more sensitive measure of the neutral fraction than is Ly
alpha, it also provides a less biased estimator of the neutral hydrogen
fraction than does the Ly alpha transmission.

revised version of L_tir (Dale & Helou 2002) (we denote L_tir2), and L_ir

found that L_ir provides excellent estimates of the total IR luminosity for a
variety of galaxy SEDs. The performance of L_tir2 was also found to be very
good. Using L_ir, we then statistically analyzed the IRAS PSCz galaxy sample
(Saunders et al. 2000) and found useful formulae relating the MIR monochromatic
luminosities [L(12um) and L(25um)], and L_ir. For this purpose we constructed a
subsample of 1420 galaxies with all IRAS four band (12, 25, 60, and 100um) flux

4-5. Hence, these formulae are useful for the estimation of the total IR
luminosity only from 12um or 25um observations. We further tried to make an
`interpolation' formula for galaxies at 0<z<1. For this purpose we construct
the formula of the relation between 15-um luminosity and the total IR

If the core is substantially crystallized, then the inner boundary for each
pulsation mode will be located at the top of the solid core rather than at the
center of the star, affecting mainly the average period spacing. This is
distinct from the ""mode trapping"" caused by the stratified surface layers,

problems, line-driving alone is the most plausible mechanism for driving the CV
winds. This conclusion is related to two facts: 1) LD wind models are likely
the best studied wind models, analytically and numerically, and 2) it is most
likely that the predictive power of the LD wind models is much higher than of
any other wind model so far. Preliminary results from LD-MHD wind models
confirm that magnetic driving is likely an important element of the wind
dynamics. However, magnetic driving does not seem to be necessary to produce a
CV wind. The most important issues which need to be addressed by future
dynamical models, regardless of driving mechanism, are the effects of the
position-dependent photoionization and the dynamical effects in three

density cusp, the differential energy distribution is only marginally affected.

radii, but the effect of a black hole on the shape of the LOSVDs (characterized

determine the K-band number counts over the 4000 sq.deg. APM survey area where
evidence for a large-scale `local hole' has previously been detected and
compare them to a homogeneous prediction. Considering a LCDM form for the
2-point angular correlation function, the observed deficiency represents a 5
sigma fluctuation in the galaxy distribution. We check the model normalisation
using faint K-band data compiled from the literature; the normalisation used in
this paper is in excellent agreement, and the observed counts over the APM
survey area would require the model to be lowered by 3.8 sigma. However, the
issue is complicated by the b>20 and b<-20 2MASS counts which lie below the
best-fit model normalisation. Second, since the K-band counts over the APM
survey area continue to suggest the possible presence of excess clustering over
the LCDM prediction, we next probe the power at large scales by comparing the
2MASS and LCDM mock galaxy angular power spectra. We find a 3 sigma excess in
the 2MASS catalogue over the LCDM prediction at large scales (l<30). However,
this excess is not enough to account for the low counts over the APM survey
area. Finally, we apply a counts in cells analysis to the 2MASS data and mock
catalogues; on the assumption that the 2MASS catalogue at |b|>20 is
representative, we find excellent agreement between the biased LCDM mocks and
the 2MASS catalogue to 30 deg. The crux of the interpretation of these results
appears to be whether the 2MASS volume is yet big enough to constitute a fair

stars BF Ori, SV Cep, UX Ori, WW Vul and XY Per. The results are based on a set
of 38 echelle spectra covering the spectral range 3800-5900 Angstroms,
monitoring the stars on time scales of months, days and hours.
  All spectra show a large number of Balmer and metallic lines with variable
blueshifted and redshifted absorption features superimposed to the photospheric
stellar spectra. Synthetic Kurucz models are used to estimate rotational
velocities, effective temperatures and gravities of the stars. The best
photospheric models are subtracted from each observed spectrum to determine the
variable absorption features due to the circumstellar gas; those features are
characterized, via multigaussian fitting, in terms of their velocity, v,
dispersion velocity, Delta_v, and residual absorption, R_max.
  The absorption components detected in each spectrum can be grouped by their
similar radial velocities and are interpreted as the signature of the dynamical
evolution of gaseous clumps. Most of the events undergo
accelerations/decelerations at a rate of tenths of ms-2. The typical timescale
for the duration of the events is a few days. The dispersion velocity and the
relative absorption strength of the features do not show drastic changes during
the lifetime of the events, which suggests that they are gaseous blobs
preserving their geometrical and physical identity.

describe the pulse shape and quantize the spectral lags and their dependences
on the spectral evolution parameters. We find that the spectral lag depends
mainly on the pulse-decay time-scale and that hard spectra (with large spectral
power-law indices alpha) give the largest lags. Similarly, large initial
peak-energies, Eo, lead to large lags, except in the case of very soft spectra.
The hardness ratio is found to depend only weakly on alpha and the HIC index,
eta. In particular, for low Eo, it is practically independent, and is
determined mainly by Eo. The relation between the hardness ratio and the lags,
for a certain Eo are described by power-laws, as alpha varies. We also discuss
the expected signatures of a sample of hard spectral pulses (e.g. thermal or
small pitch-angle synchrotron emission) versus soft spectral pulses (e.g.
optically-thin synchrotron emission). Also the expected differences between a

Explorer has given the astronomical community a marvelous glimpse into the
realm of previously unexplored regions of the Milky Way and its surroundings.
Absorption lines produced by gas along entire paths through the nearby universe
have now been recorded in the spectra of distant QSOs and active galactic
nuclei. Of the lines recorded, the O VI 1031.926, 1037.617 Angstrom doublet is
the best tracer of highly ionized regions. Exciting discoveries include a
definitive confirmation of the hot Galactic halo postulated by Lyman Spitzer
nearly 50 years ago, the discovery of a hot, highly extended Galactic corona
enveloping the Milky Way out to distances of several tens of kiloparsecs, and
the discovery of an extensive network of highly ionized, high velocity clouds

absorption features in cool stars. The new data, together with previously
obtained HST/NICMOS images in the F110W ($\sim$ J) and F160W ($\sim$ H)

populations, to the depth of our data, are dominated by luminous red supergiant
stars. However, an intermediate-age component is also present. We have
identified carbon star candidates, and show that they dominate the stellar
content for intermediate mass and age. We show that low metallicity
intermediate-age stars have, for a given colour, a F110W ($\sim$ J-band) excess

Bright BATSE bursts","Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20041562",,"astro-ph",,"  We analyze the spectral lags of a sample of bright gamma-ray burst pulses
observed by CGRO BATSE and compare these with the results of high-resolution
spectroscopical investigations. We find that pulses with hard spectra have the
largest lags, and that there is a similar, but weaker correlation between
hardness-intensity correlation index, eta, and lag. We also find that the lags
differ considerably between pulses within a burst. Furthermore, the peak energy
mainly decreases with increasing lag. Assuming a lag-luminosity relation as
suggested by Norris et al., there will thus be a positive
luminosity--peak-energy correlation. We also find that the hardness ratio, of
the total flux in two channels, only weakly correlates with the spectral
evolution parameters. These results are consistent with those found in the
analytical and numerical analysis in Paper I. Finally, we find that for these
bursts, dominated by a single pulse, there is a correlation between the
observed energy-flux, F, and the inverse of the lag, t_lag: F propto
t_lag^{-1}. We interpret this flux-lag relation found as a consequence of the
lag-luminosity relation and that these bursts have to be relatively narrowly
distributed in z. However, they still have to, mainly, lie beyond z ~ 0.01,
since they do not coincide with the local super-cluster of galaxies. We discuss
the observed correlations within the collapsar model, in which the collimation
of the outflow varies. Both the thermal photospheric emission as well as
non-thermal, optically-thin synchrotron emission should be important.

\tilde{A}(a)/\rho^{\alpha}$, where $a$ is the scale factor and
$\tilde{A}(a)=-w_XAa^{-3(1+w_X)(1+\alpha)}$. We show that the NGCG model is
totally dual to an interacting XCDM parametrization scenario, in which the
interaction between dark energy and dark matter is characterized by the
constant $\alpha$. We discuss the cosmological consequences led by such an
unified dark sectors model. Furthermore, we perform a statefinder analysis on
this scenario and show the discrimination between this scenario and other dark
energy models. Finally, a combined analysis of the data of Type Ia supernovae,
cosmic microwave background, and large scale structure provides a fairly tight
constraint on the parameters of the NGCG model.

  in Disordered Media"", edited by B.K. Chakrabarti, Elsevier 2005",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  In this chapter we review the rich behavior of polymer chains embedded in a
quenched random environment. We first consider the problem of a Gaussian chain
free to move in a random potential with short-ranged correlations. We derive
the equilibrium conformation of the chain using a replica variational ansatz,
and highlight the crucial role of the system's volume. A mapping is established
to that of a quantum particle in a random potential, and the phenomenon of
localization is explained in terms of the dominance of localized tail states of
the Schr\""odinger equation. We also give a physical interpretation of the
1-step replica-symmetry-breaking solution, and elucidate the connection with
the statistics of localized tail states. We proceeded to discuss the more
realistic case of a chain embedded in a sea of hard obstacles. Here, we show
that the chain size exhibits a rich scaling behavior, which depends critically
on the volume of the system. In particular, we show that a medium of hard
obstacles can be approximated as a Gaussian random potential only for small
system sizes. For larger sizes a completely different scaling behavior emerges.
Finally we consider the case of a polymer with self-avoiding (excluded volume)
interactions. In this case it is found that when disorder is present, the
polymer attains a conformation consisting of blobs connected by straight
segments. Using Flory type free energy arguments we analyze the statistics of
these conformational shapes, and show the existence of a
localization-delocalization transition as a function of the strength of the
self-avoiding interaction.

coefficients are {\em exactly} obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation from
the Chapman-Enskog method for states close to the (local) homogeneous cooling

two different problems. First, we solve the linearized hydrodynamic equations
around the homogeneous (cooling) state and identify the conditions for
stability as functions of the wave vector, the dissipation, and the parameters
of the mixture. As happens for monocomponent systems, the analysis shows that
the HCS is unstable to long enough wavelength perturbation. As a second
problem, we explore the validity of Onsager's reciprocal relations of a
granular binary mixture. As expected, since a granular system is not time
reversal invariant, Onsager's reciprocal relations do not apply for inelastic
collisions. The results show that the absence of the Gibbs state
(non-Maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution functions describing the
HCS), the collisional cooling, and the occurrence of different kinetic
temperatures for both species (breakdown of energy equipartition) are
responsible for a violation of Onsager's relations

Both an analytical and a numerical approach to the problem are developed. The
analytical investigation focuses on the regime of a strong wire-electric field
compared to the electric field due to the impurity. An adiabatic and
quasiclassical approximation is employed. The explicit dependencies of the
binding energy of the impurity electron on the electric field strength,
parameters of the QR and position of the impurity within the QR are obtained.
Numerical calculations of the binding energy based on a finite-difference
method in two and three dimensions are performed for arbitrary strengths of the
electric field. It is shown that the binding energy of the impurity electron
exhibits a maximum as a function of the radial position of the impurity that
can be shifted arbitrarily by applying a corresponding wire-electric field. The
maximal binding energy monotonically increases with increasing electric field
strength. The inversion effect of the electric field is found to occur. An
increase of the longitudinal displacement of the impurity typically leads to a
decrease of the binding energy. Results for both low- and high-quantum rings
are derived and discussed. Suggestions for an experimentally accessible set-up
associated with the GaAs/GaAlAs QR are provided.

This second paper considers the application of space manipulators to on-orbit
servicing (OOS), an application which has considerable commercial application.
I provide some background to the notion of robotic on-orbit servicing and
explore how manipulator control algorithms may be modified to accommodate space
manipulators which operate in the micro-gravity of space.

  Volume 1, Number 3 (2004), pp.217-222",,,"cs.RO cs.AI",,"  For many years, the idea of a human with bionic muscles immediately conjures
up science fiction images of a TV series superhuman character that was
implanted with bionic muscles and portrayed with strength and speed far
superior to any normal human. As fantastic as this idea may seem, recent
developments in electroactive polymers (EAP) may one day make such bionics
possible. Polymers that exhibit large displacement in response to stimulation
that is other than electrical signal were known for many years. Initially, EAP
received relatively little attention due to their limited actuation capability.
However, in the recent years, the view of the EAP materials has changed due to
the introduction of effective new materials that significantly surpassed the
capability of the widely used piezoelectric polymer, PVDF. As this technology
continues to evolve, novel mechanisms that are biologically inspired are
expected to emerge. EAP materials can potentially provide actuation with
lifelike response and more flexible configurations. While further improvements
in performance and robustness are still needed, there already have been several
reported successes. In recognition of the need for cooperation in this
multidisciplinary field, the author initiated and organized a series of
international forums that are leading to a growing number of research and
development projects and to great advances in the field. In 1999, he challenged
the worldwide science and engineering community of EAP experts to develop a
robotic arm that is actuated by artificial muscles to win a wrestling match
against a human opponent. In this paper, the field of EAP as artificial muscles
will be reviewed covering the state of the art, the challenges and the vision
for the progress in future years.

has been proposed independently by several authors in the past, based on the
assumption that it is possible to give a reinterpretation of the local metric
field in curved spacetimes as an integral expression involving sources and
boundary conditions. This allows one to separate source-generated and
source-free contributions to the metric field. As a consequence, an exact
meaning to Mach's Principle can be achieved in the sense that only
source-generated (matter fields) contributions to the metric are allowed for;
universes which do not obey this condition would be non-Machian. In this paper,
we revisit this idea concentrating on a Randall-Sundrum-type model with a
non-trivial cosmology on the brane. We argue that the role of the surface term

frame, of the chaos characterizing the generic cosmological solution near the
initial singularity, i.e. the so-called inhomogeneous Mixmaster model. Our
analysis is based on a ""gauge"" independent ADM-reduction of the dynamics to the
physical degrees of freedom. The out coming picture shows how the inhomogeneous
Mixmaster model is isomorphic point by point in space to a billiard on a
Lobachevsky plane. Indeed, the existence of an asymptotic (energy-like)
constant of the motion allows to construct the Jacobi metric associated to the
geodesic flow and to calculate a non-zero Lyapunov exponent in each space
point. The chaos covariance emerges from the independence of our scheme with
respect to the form of the lapse function and the shift vector; the origin of
this result relies on the dynamical decoupling of the space-points which takes
place near the singularity, due to the asymptotic approach of the potential
term to infinite walls. At the ground of the obtained dynamical scheme is the
choice of Misner-Chitre' like variables which allows to fix the billiard
potential walls.

therefore there is a large number of modes clustering on the real axis as the
black hole becomes extremal. I will show that this last statement is not only
incorrect, but that it also does not follow from Detweiler's formula, provided
it is handled with due care. It turns out that only the first n <<
-log{(r_+-r_-)/r_+} modes are well described by that formula, which translates,
for any astrophysical black hole, into one or two modes only. All existing

out the possibility of generating non--zero vacuum expectation values for the

use numerical methods to investigate whether this obstacle to deriving a local

a simple scalar-field model, we find that, although the non-equilibrium
evolution can exhibit significant damping, this damping is not well described
by the local equation of motion obtained from linear response theory. It is
possible that linear response theory does not apply to the situation we study
only because thermalization turns out to be slow, but we argue that that the

gluons through a top quark loop which generates, for large top mass, a
dimension-5 operator H tr G^2. This effective interaction leads to amplitudes
which cannot be described by the standard MHV rules; for example, amplitudes
where all of the gluons have positive helicity. We split the effective
interaction into the sum of two terms, one holomorphic (selfdual) and one
anti-holomorphic (anti-selfdual). The holomorphic interactions give a new set
of MHV vertices -- identical in form to those of pure gauge theory, except for
momentum conservation -- that can be combined with pure gauge theory MHV
vertices to produce a tower of amplitudes with more than two negative
helicities. Similarly, the anti-holomorphic interactions give anti-MHV vertices
that can be combined with pure gauge theory anti-MHV vertices to produce a
tower of amplitudes with more than two positive helicities. A Higgs boson
amplitude is the sum of one MHV-tower amplitude and one anti-MHV-tower
amplitude. We present all MHV-tower amplitudes with up to four

paper we develop a new approach to differential geometry of so-called rank 1
curves in Lagrange Grassmannian, i.e., the curves with velocities being rank
one linear mappings (under the standard identification of the tangent space to
a point of the Lagrange Grassmannian with an appropriate space of linear
mappings). The curves of this class are associated with ""the Jacobi equations
for extremals"", corresponding to control systems with scalar control and to
rank 2 vector distributions. In particular, we construct the tuple of m
principal invariants, where m is equal to half of dimension of the ambient
linear symplectic space, such that for a given tuple of arbitrary m smooth
functions there exists the unique, up to a symplectic transformation, rank 1
curve having this tuple, as the tuple of the principal invariants. This
approach extends and essentially simplifies some results of our previous paper
(J. Dynamical and Control Systems, 8, 2002, No. 1, 93-140), where only the
uniqueness part was proved and in rather cumbersome way. It is based on the
construction of the new canonical moving frame with the most simple structural
equation.

effect of social policy interventions (e.g., training programs or health care
measures). Given an outcome variable, a treatment and a set of pre-treatment
covariates, the method is based on the examination of random recursive
partitions of the space of covariates using regression trees. A regression tree
is grown either on the treated or on the untreated individuals {\it only} using
as response variable a random permutation of the indexes 1...$n$ ($n$ being the
number of units involved), while the indexes for the other group are predicted
using this tree. The procedure is replicated in order to rule out the effect of
specific permutations. The average treatment effect is estimated in each tree
by matching treated and untreated in the same terminal nodes. The final
estimator of the average treatment effect is obtained by averaging on all the
trees grown. The method does not require any specific model assumption apart
from the tree's complexity, which does not affect the estimator though. We show
that this method is either an instrument to check whether two samples can be
matched (by any method) and, when this is feasible, to obtain reliable
estimates of the average treatment effect. We further propose a graphical tool
to inspect the quality of the match. The method has been applied to the
National Supported Work Demonstration data, previously analyzed by Lalonde
(1986) and others.

magnetized coaxial gun provide insight into the magnetic topology evolution
resulting from magnetic helicity injection. Important features of the
experiments are a very simple coaxial gun design so that all observed
geometrical complexity is due to the intrinsic physical dynamics rather than
the source shape and use of a fast multiple-frame digital camera which provides
direct imaging of topologically complex shapes and dynamics. Three key
experimental findings were obtained: (1) formation of an axial collimated jet
[Hsu and Bellan, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 334, 257 (2002)] that is consistent
with a magnetohydrodynamic description of astrophysical jets, (2)
identification of the kink instability when this jet satisfies the
Kruskal-Shafranov limit, and (3) the nonlinear properties of the kink
instability providing a conversion of toroidal to poloidal flux as required for
spheromak formation by a coaxial magnetized source [Hsu and Bellan, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 90, 215002 (2003)]. A new interpretation is proposed for how the n=1
central column instability provides flux amplification during spheromak

intense, linearly polarized laser fields is influenced by the initial states in
which both electrons are bound, and by the residual ionic potential. We assume
that the second electron is released by electron-impact ionization of the first
electron with its parent ion, using an S-Matrix approach. We work within the
Strong-Field Approximation, and compute differential electron momentum
distributions using saddle-point methods. Specifically, we consider electrons
in $1s$, $2p$, $3p$ and localized states, which are released by either a
contact or a Coulomb-type interaction. We also perform an adequate treatment of
the bound-state singularity which is present in this framework. We show that
the momentum distributions are very sensitive with respect to spatially
extended or localized wave functions, but are not considerably influenced by
their shape. Furthermore, the modifications performed in order to overcome the
bound-state singularity do not significantly alter the momentum distributions,
apart from a minor suppression in the region of small momenta. The only radical
changes occur if one employs effective form factors, which take into account
the presence of the residual ion upon rescattering. If the ionic potential is
of contact type, it outweighs the spreading caused by a long-range
electron-electron interaction, or by spatially extended bound states. This
leads to momentum distributions which exhibit a very good agreement with the
existing experiments.

analysis on the non-dissipative forced harmonic oscillator, and its free mass
limit. We derive an explicit formula for the time evolution of the expectation
of a general operator in the presence of stochastic reduction or
environmentally induced decoherence, for both the non-dissipative harmonic
oscillator and the free mass. In the case of the oscillator, we also give a
formula for the time evolution of the matrix element of the stochastic
expectation density matrix between general coherent states. We show that the
stochastic expectation of the variance of a Hermitian operator in any
unraveling of the stochastic process is bounded by the variance computed from
the stochastic expectation of the density matrix, and we develop a formal
perturbation theory for calculating expectation values of operators within any
unraveling. Applying our results to current gravitational wave interferometer
detectors and nanomechanical systems, we conclude that the deviations from
quantum mechanics predicted by the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL)
