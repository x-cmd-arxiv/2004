the observed spectrum of gamma-ray bursts due to the Doppler effect in the
fireball framework. The analysis shows that: a) in the spectrum of a
relativistically expanding fireball, all rest frame lines would shift to higher
energy bands and would be significantly smoothed; b) rest frame weak narrow
emission lines as well as narrow absorption lines and absorption line forests
would be smoothed and would hardly be detectable; c) the features of rest frame
broad emission lines as well as both strong and weak broad absorption lines
would remain almost unchanged and therefore would be easier to detect; d) deep
gaps caused by rest frame broad absorption lines would be significantly filled;
e) a rest frame emission line forest would form a single broad line feature; f)
the observed relative width of the rest frame very narrow line would approach $
0.162$; g) when the Lorentz factor $\Gamma $ is large enough, the observed line
frequency $\nu_{line}$ and the rest frame line frequency $\nu_{0,line} $ would
be related by $\nu_{line}\approx 2\Gamma \nu_{0,line}$. We also investigate the
effect of time dependence of the line intensity and the effect of variation of
$\Gamma $. We find that the feature of rest frame dimming narrow emission lines
would disappear when $\Gamma $ is very large. The form of emission lines would
be sharp on both edges when $\Gamma $ varies with time. This phenomenon depends
not only on the initial Lorentz factor but also on the observation time.

terms of the integral of time, of gamma-ray bursts in the framework of

key factor to be concerned. Effects arising from the limit of the time delay
due to the limited regions of the emitting areas in the fireball surface and
other factors are investigated. Our analysis shows that the formula of the
count rate of fireballs can be expressed as a function of $\tau $ which is the
observation time scale relative to the dynamical time scale of the fireball.
The profile of light curves of fireballs depends only on the relative time
scale, entirely independent of the real time scale and the real size of the
objects. It displays in detail how a cutoff tail, or a turn over, feature
(called a cutoff tail problem) in the decay phase of a light curve can be
formed. This feature is a consequence of a hot spot in the fireball surface,
moving towards the observer, and was observed in a few cases previously. By
performing fits to the count rate light curves of six sample sources, we show
how to obtain some physical parameters from the observed profile of the count
rate of GRBs. In addition, the analysis reveals that the Doppler effect of
fireballs could lead to a power law relationship between the $FWHM$ of pulses
and energy, which were observed previously by many authors.

with those of the X-ray ``afterglows'' of ordinary GRBs, X-ray Flashes, and
ordinary supernovae, evidence emerges for at least two classes of lightcurves,
perhaps bounding a continuum. By three to ten years, all these phenomena seem
to converge on a common X-ray luminosity, possibly indicative of the supernova
underlying them all. This convergence strengthens the conclusion that SN 1998bw

for kinematic warps is observed in several cases well inside R_{25}. No
unambiguous evidence for radial inflows is seen in any of the seven galaxies,

the coherence function, i.e. the cross-correlation coefficient of the Fourier
modes of gravity and velocity fields. The second one is the ratio of velocity
power spectrum to gravity power spectrum. To date, in all analyzes of the LG
acceleration the second quantity was not accounted for. Extending our previous
work, we study both the coherence function and the ratio of the power spectra.
With the aid of numerical simulations we obtain expressions for the two as
functions of wavevector and \sigma_8. Adopting WMAP's best determination of
\sigma_8, we estimate the most likely value of the parameter \beta and its
errors. As the observed values of the LG velocity and gravity, we adopt
respectively a CMB-based estimate of the LG velocity, and Schmoldt et al.'s
(1999) estimate of the LG acceleration from the PSCz catalog. We obtain \beta =

sources in the far-IR/(sub)-millimeter channels of ESA/ISO, NASA/Spitzer,
ESA/Herschel and ESA/Planck satellites, including the contribution from
clustering of unresolved SCUBA galaxies. Clustering is found to increase the
confusion noise, compared to the case of purely Poisson fluctuations, by 10-15%
for the lowest frequency (i.e. lowest angular resolution) Spitzer and Herschel
channels, by 25-35% for the 175 micron ISOPHOT channel, and to dominate in the
case of Planck/HFI channels at nu>143GHz. Although our calculations make use of
a specific evolutionary model (Granato et al. 2004), the results are strongly
constrained by the observed counts and by data on the redshift distribution of
SCUBA sources, and therefore are not expected to be heavily model dependent.
The main uncertainty arises from the poor observational definition of the
source clustering properties. Two models have been used for the latter: a
power-law with constant slope and a redshift-independent comoving correlation
length,r_0, and the standard theoretical model for clustering evolution in a
LambdaCDM universe, with a redshift-dependent bias factor. In both cases, the
clustering amplitude has been normalized to yield a unit angular correlation
function at theta_0=1-2 arcsec for 850 micron sources fainter than 2 mJy,
consistent with the results by Peacock et al. (2000). This normalization
yields, for the first model, r_0=8.3$ Mpc/h, and, for the second model, an
effective mass of dark matter haloes in which these sources reside of
M_halo=1.8*10^{13} M_sun/h. These results are consistent with independent
estimates for SCUBA galaxies and for other, likely related, sources.

renormalization. In a first approach, we assess the importance of the so called

is sufficient to stabilize suspension against a fluid-fluid phase separation.
Presence of salt, on the other hand, is found to lead to an instability. A very
strong dependence on the approximations used, however, puts the reality of this
phase transition in a serious doubt. To further understand the nature of the
instability we next study a Jellium-like approximation, which does not lead to
a phase separation and produces a relatively accurate analytical equation of
state for a deionized suspensions of highly charged colloidal spheres. A
critical analysis of various theories of strongly asymmetric electrolytes is

that incorporates non-inertial frame effects due to the noncommutative nature

we show that neutrino's helicity is not a constant of the motion in the

transition rate generally depends on the zeroth-order component of the

is also shown that the chiral current for high-energy neutrinos is altered by
corrections due to curvature and frame-dependent effects, but should have no
significant bearing on the chiral anomaly in curved space-time. We determine
the upper bound for helicity and chirality transitions near the event horizon

which are based on the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE) indicate an
infrared power law behavior of the gluon and the ghost propagators. It has been
shown that the gluon propagator vanishes (or finite) in the infrared limit,
while the ghost propagator is more singular than a massless pole, and also that
there exists an infrared fixed point of the running gauge coupling. In this
paper we reexamine this picture by means of the exact (non-perturbative)
renormalization group (ERG) equations under some approximation scheme, in which
we treat not only two point functions but also four point vertices in the
effective average action with retaining their momentum dependence. Then it is
shown that the gluon and the ghost propagators with the infrared power law
behavior are obtained as an attractive solution starting from rather arbitrary
ultraviolet bare actions. Here it is found to be crucial to include the
momentum dependent four point vertices in the ERG framework, since otherwise
the RG flows diverge at finite scales. The features of the ERG analyses in
comparison with the SDE are also discussed.

Sitter (AdS) background, and a pair of charged or neutral black holes is
produced at the ends of the strings. The energy to materialize and accelerate
the pair comes from the strings tension. In an AdS background this is the only
study done in the process of production of a pair of correlated black holes
with spherical topology. The acceleration $A$ of the produced black holes is
necessarily greater than (|L|/3)^(1/2), where L<0 is the cosmological constant.
Only in this case the virtual pair of black holes can overcome the attractive
background AdS potential well and become real. The instantons that describe
this process are constructed through the analytical continuation of the AdS
C-metric. Then, we explicitly compute the pair creation rate of the process,
and we verify that (as occurs with pair creation in other backgrounds) the pair
production of nonextreme black holes is enhanced relative to the pair creation
of extreme black holes by a factor of exp(Area/4), where Area is the black hole
horizon area. We also conclude that the general behavior of the pair creation
rate with the mass and acceleration of the black holes is similar in the AdS,
flat and de Sitter cases, and our AdS results reduce to the ones of the flat
case when L=0.

assumptions, it yields an exact formula for the mixed Monge-Ampere mass of two

within this class. We show that m(La(p))>0 under a `global ubiquity' hypothesis
and the divergence of a certain m--volume sum. In fact, under a `local
ubiquity' hypothesis we show that La(p) has full measure; i.e. m(La(p)) =1 .
This is the analogue of the divergent part of the classical Khintchine-Groshev
theorem in number theory. Moreover, if the 'local ubiquity' hypothesis is
satisfied and a certain f-volume sum diverges then we are able to show that the
Hausdorff f--measure of La(p) is infinite. A simple consequence of this is a
lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of La(p) and various results concerning
the dimension and measure of related `exact order' sets.
  Essentially, the notion of `local ubiquity' unexpectedly unifies `divergent'
type results for La(p) with respect to the natural measure m and general
Hausdorff measures. Applications of the general framework include those from
number theory, Kleinian groups and rational maps. Even for the classical limsup
sets of `well approximable' numbers, the framework strengthens the classical
Hausdorff measure result of Jarnik and opens up the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture
for Hausdorff measures.

it is not proper to be used as the definition. It is found the way through the
value of the effective area S covered by the scatter $\omega-\psi$ plot, which

Dueck via general quantum channels, extending investigations for classical
channels, initial work for classical-quantum (cq) channels and ""quantum
fingerprinting"".
  We show that the identification capacity of a discrete memoryless quantum
channel for classical information can be larger than that for transmission;
this is in contrast to all previously considered models, where it turns out to
equal the common randomness capacity (equals transmission capacity in our
case): in particular, for a noiseless qubit, we show the identification
capacity to be 2, while transmission and common randomness capacity are 1.
  Then we turn to a natural concept of identification of quantum messages (i.e.
a notion of ""fingerprint"" for quantum states). This is much closer to quantum
information transmission than its classical counterpart (for one thing, the
code length grows only exponentially, compared to double exponentially for
classical identification). Indeed, we show how the problem exhibits a nice
connection to visible quantum coding. Astonishingly, for the noiseless qubit
channel this capacity turns out to be 2: in other words, one can compress two
qubits into one and this is optimal. In general however, we conjecture quantum
identification capacity to be different from classical identification capacity.

local terms in the Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we show that the amount of
ground-state entanglement is bounded above by a ratio between parameters
characterizing the strength of interactions in the system, and the local energy
scale. Finally, we prove a qualitatively similar result for other energy
eigenstates of the system.

"quant-ph/0401062","Scott Aaronson","Scott Aaronson","Is Quantum Mechanics An Island In Theoryspace?","9 pages, minor corrections",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This recreational paper investigates what happens if we change quantum
mechanics in several ways. The main results are as follows. First, if we
replace the 2-norm by some other p-norm, then there are no nontrivial
norm-preserving linear maps. Second, if we relax the demand that norm be
preserved, we end up with a theory that allows rapid solution of PP-complete
problems (as well as superluminal signalling). And third, if we restrict
amplitudes to be real, we run into a difficulty much simpler than the usual one
based on parameter-counting of mixed states.

probability theory? It is argued that the elementary formalism of quantum
mechanics operates as a well-justified alternative to 'classical'
instantiations of a probability calculus. Its providing a general framework for
prediction accounts for its distinctive traits, which one should be careful not
to mistake for reflections of any strange ontology. The suggestion is also made
that quantum theory unwittingly emerged, in Schroedinger's formulation, as a
'lossy' by-product of a quantum-mechanical variant of the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. As it turns out, the effectiveness of quantum theory qua predictive
algorithm makes up for the computational impracticability of that master
equation.
