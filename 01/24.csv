strongly irradiated gaseous exoplanets, we have calculated the consistent
evolution of the new transiting planet, OGLE-TR-56b, for its recently revised
mass determination. The theory is shown to successfully reproduce the observed
radius, for the proper age of the system. We also examine the dissipation of
kinetic energy at the planet's internal adiabat due to atmospheric winds, and
place constraints on the efficiency of this process. We show that a fraction
$\sim 0.1$ -- 0.5% of the incident flux transformed into thermal energy
deposited at the adiabatic level can accommodate the observed radii of both
OGLE-TR-56b and HD209458b. The present theory yields quantitative predictions
on the evolution of the emergent spectrum and fundamental properties of

envelopes. We show that this model is able to reproduce the results of
numerical simulations for convective efficiencies ranging from very inefficient
to moderately efficient; this agreement is made more impressive given that no
closure parameters have been adjusted in going from the previously reported
case of A-stars to the present case of white dwarfs; for comparison, in order
to match the peak convective flux found in numerical simulations for both the
white dwarf envelopes discussed in this paper and the A-star envelopes
discussed in our previous work requires changing the mixing length parameter of
commonly used local models by a factor of 4. We also examine in detail the
overshooting at the base of the convection zone, both in terms of the
convective flux and in terms of the velocity field: we find that the flux
overshoots by approximately 1.25 H_P and the velocity by approximately 2.5 H_P.
Due to the large amount of overshooting found at the base of the convection
zone the new model predicts the mixed region of white dwarf envelopes to
contain at least 10 times more mass than local mixing length theory (MLT)
models having similar photospheric temperature structures. This result is
consistent with the upper limit given by numerical simulations which predict an
even larger amount of mass to be mixed by convective overshooting. Finally, we
attempt to parametrise some of our results in terms of local MLT-based models,
insofar as is possible given the limitations of MLT

This work was strongly motivated by Archeops CMB experiment data analysis. We
believe that Archeops was a good test bench for the future Planck Surveyor data
analysis, and Mirage was designed in order to be used for Planck data
processing with minimal work. A strong feature of Mirage is that it handles
experimental problems in data, such as holes in data stream, bright sources,
and galaxy side effects, without jeopardising speed. The other advantage is its
processing speed, allowing to run Monte Carlo simulations of Archeops data
processing on a single processor workstation overnight. Algorithms are
explained. Systematic effects on SHPS are investigated on various simulated
data, including typical Archeops observational systematics.

  The detection of only a single quasar in the redshift range accessible to the

less significant increases in flux densities were observed at 1.3 cm and 2 cm.
The radio observation started 13.5 hrs after the onset of the X-ray flare
(which had occurred over a 45 min duration) and continued for 1.3 hrs. During
the observation, there was no significant ($<3\sigma$) change in the radio flux

varied on a timescale of $>1$hr. A spectral index of $\alpha=2.4^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$

consistent with an optically thick nonthermal synchrotron source. These results
suggest that energetic electrons responsible for the radio outburst might be
produced via a process associated with the X-ray flare, then transported to

first evidence for a correlated variation in the radio and X-ray emissions from

focusing on some galaxy evolution unresolved problems. In particular our
knowledge of the star formation rate which leads galaxy evolution, i.e.
luminosity, colors and dust enrichment, is still very poor. Smoothed particle
hydrodynamic simulations including chemo-photometric evolutionary population
synthesis models of isolated collapsing systems endowed with triaxial dark
matter halos, gas and the star formation switched on, are a useful tool to shed
light on several open questions. This approach, which allows a greater particle
resolution than a fully consistent cosmological scenario, gives us important
insights into connections between dark and luminous matter. Both the initial
properties of the halo, as so as its geometry and dynamical state, and total
mass of the system, drive the galaxy formation and evolution. In our simple
framework spiral galaxies arise only in systems with both a total mass less
than 1.e12 solar masses and a critical value of the baryonic-to-total-mass
ratio, around its cosmological value, 0.1. For the same value of such a ratio
more massive systems host more luminous and redder galaxies, as a consequence
of the stronger burst of star formation arising into their halos earlier on.
Moreover the star formation does not switch on in the less massive DM halos so
that the critical mass to entail a luminous system is 1.e11 solar masses. For a
given total mass, higher values of the baryonic-to-total-mass ratio provide
galaxies with lower rotational support so that no constraints to the total mass
of the system hosting an elliptical galaxy have been derived.

is sensitive to these processes as well as to the momentum-dependence of the
diffusion coefficients and the compression ratio, and so the spectrum of any
radiation emitted by the accelerated particles may reflect the physical
conditions of the acceleration region. Results presented in this paper have
applications in interpreting the spectral energy distributions of many types of
astrophysical object including supernova remnants (SNR), active galactic nuclei
(AGN) and acceleration sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHE CR).
Except for extremely nearby sources, spectral features imprinted on the
spectrum of UHE CR during the acceleration process will be largely eroded
during propagation, but the spectrum of UHE neutrinos produced in interactions
of UHE CR with radiation, both during cosmic ray acceleration and subsequent
propagation through the cosmic microwave background radiation, contains
sufficient information to determine the cut-off momentum of the UHE CR just
after acceleration for reasonable assumptions. Observation of these UHE
neutrinos by the Pierre Auger Observatory may help in identifying the sources
of the highest energy cosmic rays.

``type-I'' LINER galaxy. Our goal is to test the extent to which
radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models and/or scaled-down AGN
models are consistent with the observed properties of NGC 3998. The upper-limit
for narrow Fe-K emission derived from a combined fit of the XMM-Newton and
BeppoSAX spectra is 25 eV, which is one of the strictest limits to date for any
AGN. This significantly rules out Fe-K emission as is expected to be observed
in typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The lack of any reflection features suggests
that any optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk must be truncated,
probably at a radius of order 100-300 R_s. RIAF models fit the UV to X-ray
spectral energy distribution of NGC 3998 reasonably well. In these models the
mid-IR flux also constrains the emission from any outer thin disk component
that might be present. The UV to X-ray SED is also consistent with a
Comptonized thin disk with a very low accretion rate, in which case the lack of
Fe-K emission may be due to an ionized accretion disk. Accretion models in
general do not account for the observed radio flux of NGC 3998, and the radio
flux may be due to a jet. Recent jet models may also be consistent with the
nuclear fluxes of NGC 3998 in general, including the X-ray, optical/UV and
mid-IR bands. We also derive nuclear fluxes using archival HST WFPC2 data to
constrain the SED of NGC 3998. We discuss a possible OM U band and USNO-B
detection of the NGC 3998 ULX.

ultraluminous X-ray objects (ULXs). Our primary goal is to establish the
fraction of galaxies containing a ULX as a function of ULX luminosity. Our
sample is based on ROSAT HRI observations of galaxies. We find that ~ 12% of
galaxies contain at least one ULX with L_X > 10^39 erg/s and ~ 1% of galaxies
contain at least one ULX with L_X > 10^40 erg/s. These ULX frequencies are
lower limits since ROSAT HRI observation would miss absorbed ULXs (i.e., with
N_H >~ 10^21 cm^-2) and those within ~ 10"" of the nucleus (due to the
positional error circle of the ROSAT HRI). The Hubble type distribution of
galaxies with a ULX differs significantly from the distribution of types for
nearby RC3 galaxies, but does not differ significantly from the galaxy type
distribution of galaxies observed by the HRI in general. We find no increase in
the mean FIR luminosity or FIR / K band luminosity ratio for galaxies with a
ULX relative to galaxies observed by the HRI in general, however this result is
also most likely biased by the soft bandpass of the HRI and the relatively low
number of high SFR galaxies observed by the HRI with enough sensitivity to
detect a ULX.

approach, we compute the force for the specific case of a flat plate and a
plate with a rectangular corrugation. We obtain complementary analytical and
numerical results which allow us to identify two different scaling regimes for
the force as a function of the mean plate distance, corrugation amplitude and
wave length. Qualitative distinctions between transversal electric and magnetic
modes are revealed. Our results demonstrate the importance of a careful
consideration of the non-additivity of Casimir forces, especially in strongly
non-planar geometries. Non-perturbative effects due to surface edges are found.
Strong deviations from the commonly used proximity force approximation emerge
over a wide range of corrugation wave lengths, even though the surface is
composed only of flat segments. We compare our results to that of a
perturbative approach and a classical optics approximation.

constituent particles, where $N(t)$ is the total number of particles in that
realization at time $t$. When $\{k_i(t)\}$ are arranged in the ascending order
of magnitudes, the instantaneous front position can be denoted by the location
of the rightmost particle, i.e., by the extremal value
$k_f(t)=\text{max}[k_1(t),k_2(t),...,k_{N(t)}(t)]$. Due to interparticle
interactions, $\{k_i(t)\}$ at two different times for a single front
realization are naturally not independent of each other, and thus the
probability distribution $P_{k_f}(t)$ [based on an ensemble of such front
realizations] describes extreme value statistics for a set of correlated random
variables. In view of the fact that exact results for correlated extreme value
statistics are rather rare, here we show that for a fermionic front model in a
reaction-diffusion system, $P_{k_f}(t)$ is Gaussian. In a bosonic front model
however, we observe small deviations from the Gaussian.

conductors in which the electric potential is zero and it does not fluctuate,
or as good conductors in which the average electric potential is zero but the
thermal fluctuations of the potential are not zero. This latter model is more
realistic. For the ideal conductor model we find that the disjoining pressure

universal, i.e. independent of the microscopic constitution of the system. For
the good conductor boundaries the disjoining pressure is negative and it has an
exponential decay for large $W$. We also compute the density and electric

masses of the $W$, $Z$ and Higgs bosons are assumed to be degenerate. This work
is a continuation of our previous evaluation of master integrals containing at
most 1 massive propagator. The 1/\epsilon poles and the finite parts are
computed exactly in terms of a {\it new} class of 1-dimensional harmonic
polylogarithms of the variable x, with \epsilon=2-D/2 and D the pace-time
dimension. Since thresholds and pseudothresholds in s=\pm 4m^2 do appear in
addition to the old ones in s=0,\pm m^2, an extension of the basis function set
involving complex constants and radicals is introduced, together with a set of
recursion equations to reduce integrals with semi-integer powers. It is shown
that the basic properties of the harmonic polylogarithms are maintained by the
generalization. We derive small-momentum expansions |s| << m^2 of all the
6-denominator amplitudes. We also present large momentum expansions |s| >> m^2
of all the 6-denominator amplitudes which can be represented in terms of
ordinary harmonic polylogarithms. Comparison with previous results in the
literature is performed finding complete agreement.

throughout. To account for the vacuum choice ambiguity in cosmological
settings, we introduce an arbitrary boundary action representing the initial
conditions. RG flow in these spacetimes naturally affects the boundary
interactions. As a consequence the boundary conditions are sensitive to
high-energy physics through irrelevant terms in the boundary action. Using
scalar field theory as an example, we derive the leading dimension four
irrelevant boundary operators. We discuss how the known vacuum choices, e.g.
the Bunch-Davies vacuum, appear in the Lagrangian description and square with
decoupling. For all choices of boundary conditions encoded by relevant boundary
operators, of which the known ones are a subset, backreaction is under control.
All, moreover, will generically feel the influence of high-energy physics
through irrelevant (dimension four) boundary corrections. Having established a
coherent effective field theory framework including the vacuum choice
ambiguity, we derive an explicit expression for the power spectrum of
inflationary density perturbations including the leading high energy
corrections. In accordance with the dimensionality of the leading irrelevant
operators, the effect of high energy physics is linearly proportional to the
Hubble radius H and the scale of new physics L= 1/M.

The space-time sector is a generalization of the well known non-commutative

invariance, not even in the deformed sense. It is shown that this behavior
could be expected in some attempts to construct DSR theories starting from the

hamiltonian 2-form (which were classified locally in part I of this work). This
involves two components of independent interest.
  The first is the notion of a rigid hamiltonian torus action. This natural
condition, for torus actions on a Kaehler manifold, was introduced locally in
part I, but such actions turn out to be remarkably well behaved globally,
leading to a fairly explicit classification: up to a blow-up, compact Kaehler
manifolds with a rigid hamiltonian torus action are bundles of toric Kaehler
manifolds.
  The second idea is a special case of toric geometry, which we call
orthotoric. We prove that orthotoric Kaehler manifolds are diffeomorphic to
complex projective space, but we extend our analysis to orthotoric orbifolds,
where the geometry is much richer. We thus obtain new examples of
Kaehler--Einstein 4-orbifolds.
  Combining these two themes, we prove that compact Kaehler manifolds with
hamiltonian 2-forms are covered by blow-downs of projective bundles over
Kaehler products, and we describe explicitly how the Kaehler metrics with a
hamiltonian 2-form are parameterized. We explain how this provides a context
for constructing new examples of extremal Kaehler metrics - in particular a
subclass of such metrics which we call weakly Bochner-flat.
  We also provide a self-contained treatment of the theory of compact toric
Kaehler manifolds, since we need it and find the existing literature
incomplete.

and classifies and constructs all finite dimensional irreducible calibrated
representations. The primary technique is to provide indexing sets for
controlling the weight space structure of finite dimensional modules for the
affine Hecke algebra. Using these indexing sets we show that (1) irreducible
calibrated representations are indexed by skew local regions, (2) the dimension
of an irreducible calibrated representation is the number of chambers in the
local region, (3) each irreducible calibrated representation is constructed
explicitly by formulas which describe the action of the generators of the
affine Hecke algebra on a specific basis in the representation space. The
indexing sets for weight spaces are generalizations of standard Young tableaux
and the construction of the irreducible calibrated affine Hecke algebra modules
is a generalization of A. Young's seminormal construction of the irreducible
representations of the symmetric group. In this sense Young's construction has
been generalized to arbitrary Lie type.

  bottom boundary characteristics: possible implications for eddy
  parameterizations",,,,,"physics.ao-ph",,"  The Eady problem of baroclinic instability as applicable to quasi-geostrophic
oceanic flows with zero internal PV gradients is revisited by introducing a
mild slope and Ekman pumping on the lower boundary. The solution behaviour is
determined by the isopycnal slope relative to either the bottom slope or the
ratio of Ekman depth to horizontal wavenumber. Attention is paid to the
physical interpretation of the growing, decaying and stable disturbances, with
emphasis on the intimate connection between the quasigeostrophic edge waves and
Eady waves, and the role of the isopycnal slope for the stability properties as
opposed to the bottom density gradient. The disturbance structure is found to
be strongly influenced by the boundary conditions.
  For a sloping bottom boundary, the growth rate is enhanced for the most
unstable waves if the isopycnals tilt in the same direction as the bottom, but
in general non-standard boundary conditions tend to retard the growth of
disturbances. In particular, the existence of the long- and short-wave cutoffs
is found to be very sensitive to boundary conditions, both for the sloping
topography and the Ekman pumping. It is suggested that any cutoffs for the
growth rate in an Eady-like problem actually result from the chosen boundary
conditions. However, for a certain range of parameters, the maximum growth rate
is comparable to that found in the original Eady problem, which may explain the
fair success enjoyed by recent eddy parameterizations basing their timescale on
the Eady growth rate.

feedback loops based on transcriptional regulation of per, Clk (dclock), Pdp-1,
and vri (vrille). The model postulates that histone acetylation kinetics make
transcriptional activation a nonlinear function of [CLK]. Such a nonlinearity
is essential to simulate robust circadian oscillations of transcription in our
model and in previous models. Simulations suggest two positive feedback loops
involving Clk are not essential for oscillations, because oscillations of [PER]
were preserved when Clk, vri, or Pdp-1 expression was fixed. Eliminating the
negative feedback loop in which PER represses per expression abolished
oscillations. Simulations of per or Clk null mutations and of vri, Clk, or
Pdp-1 heterozygous null mutations altered model behavior in ways similar to
experimental data. The model simulated a photic phase-response curve resembling
experimental curves, and oscillations entrained to simulated light-dark cycles.
The model makes experimental predictions, some of which could be tested in
transgenic Drosophila.

confirmed at the shortest separation). An independent determination of the
accuracy of the theoretical calculations of the Casimir force and its
application to the experimental configuration is carefully made. Special
attention is paid to the sample-dependent variations of the optical tabulated
data due to the presence of grains, contribution of surface plasmons, and
errors introduced by the use of the proximity force theorem. Nonmultiplicative
and diffraction-type contributions to the surface roughness corrections are
examined. The electric forces due to patch potentials resulting from the
polycrystalline nature of the gold films are estimated. The finite size and
thermal effects are found to be negligible. The theoretical accuracy of about
1.69% and 1.1% are found at a separation 62 nm and 200 nm, respectively. Within
