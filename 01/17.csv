idea that Galactic extinction curves can be considered a 1-parameter family
characterized by their value of R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). Based on analysis of new
(i.e., 2MASS) and old (i.e., IUE) data for about 100 sightlines, I show that
the UV, optical, and IR wavelength regimes do display coherent variations, but
with too much intrinsic scatter to be considered truly correlated. A
1-parameter family can be constructed which illustrates these broad trends, but
very few individual sightlines are actually well-reproduced by such a family
and disagreement with the mean trends is not a sufficient condition for
``peculiarity.'' Only a very small number of extinction sightlines stand out as
truly peculiar. It is likely that simple variations in the mean grain size from
sightline to sightline are responsible for much of the coherent variability
seen in Galactic extinction, and might also explain the ``peculiar'' extinction
long-noted in the Magellanic Clouds.

are the prospects of investigating the gravitational field of a black
hole--disc system by analytical solutions of stationary, axially symmetric
Einstein's equations. Then, more detailed considerations are focused to middle
and outer parts of extended disc-like configurations where relativistic effects
are small and the Newtonian description is adequate.
  Within general relativity, only a static case has been analysed in detail.
Results are often very inspiring, however, simplifying assumptions must be
imposed: ad hoc profiles of the disc density are commonly assumed and the
effects of frame-dragging and completely lacking. Astrophysical discs (e.g.
accretion discs in active galactic nuclei) typically extend far beyond the
relativistic domain and are fairly diluted. However, self-gravity is still
essential for their structure and evolution, as well as for their radiation
emission and the impact on the environment around. For example, a nuclear star
cluster in a galactic centre may bear various imprints of mutual star--disc
interactions, which can be recognised in observational properties, such as the
relation between the central mass and stellar velocity dispersion.

Observations of young brown dwarfs may help distinguish among different

that the low-temperature behaviour of the n-layer ruthenates

(VHS). We consider a single band whose Fermi energy, E_F, is close to the VHS
and deduce a complex phase diagram for the magnetism as a function of
temperature, magnetic field and E_F. The location of E_F with respect to the
VHS depends on the number of layers or can be tuned by pressure. We find that
the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in this case is not of second but of
first order, with a metamagnetic quantum critical endpoint at high magnetic

uniform magnetism in the single, double and triple layer ruthenates. We would

involving dynamical spacetimes containing black holes in the presence of

fluid star from the onset of collapse to the settling of the resulting black
hole to a final stationary state. In order to evolve stably after the black
hole forms, we excise a region inside the hole before a singularity is
encountered. This excision region is introduced after the appearance of an
apparent horizon, but while a significant amount of matter remains outside the
hole. We test our code by evolving accurately a vacuum Schwarzschild black
hole, a relativistic Bondi accretion flow onto a black hole, Oppenheimer-Snyder
dust collapse, and the collapse of nonrotating and rotating stars. These
systems are tracked reliably for hundreds of M following excision, where M is
the mass of the black hole. We perform these tests both in axisymmetry and in
full 3+1 dimensions. We then apply our code to study the effect of the stellar
spin parameter J/M^2 on the final outcome of gravitational collapse of rapidly
rotating n = 1 polytropes. We find that a black hole forms only if J/M^2<1, in
agreement with previous simulations. When J/M^2>1, the collapsing star forms a
torus which fragments into nonaxisymmetric clumps, capable of generating
appreciable ``splash'' gravitational radiation.

the Maxwell wave is not the same as the maximum signal velocity determined by
the null geodesic condition, which is infinitely large near the Planck time and
monotonically decreases in time to the conventional light velocity when time
approaches infinity. This implies that, depending on the position of the

inside or outside the null cone determined by the null geodesic equation, which
may lead to the causality problem.

we compute the rate for the production of a hard jet together with missing
energy. We find a nontrivial range of graviscalar couplings to which ATLAS
could be sensitive, with experiments being more sensitive to couplings to
gluons than to quarks. Graviscalar emission increases the missing-energy signal
by adding to graviton production, and so complicates the inference of the
extra-dimensional Planck scale from an observed rate. Because graviscalar
differential cross sections resemble those for gravitons, it is unlikely that
these can be experimentally distinguished from one another should a missing

dimensions with N = 1 supersymmetry is achieved on a torus fibered Calabi-Yau
3-fold Z = X / tau_{X} with first homotopy group pi_{1}(Z) = Z_{2}. Here X is
an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 3-fold which admits two global sections and
\tau_{X} is a freely acting involution on X. The vacua in this class have net
number of three generations of chiral fermions in the observable sector and may
contain M5-branes in the bulk space which wrap holomorphic curves in Z. Vacua
with nonvanishing and vanishing instanton charges in the observable sector are
considered. The latter case corresponds to potentially viable matter Yukawa
couplings. Since pi_{1}(Z) = Z_{2}, the grand unification group can be broken
with Z_{2} Wilson lines.
  The motivation is to use the above formalism to extend realistic
free-fermionic models to the nonperturbative regime. The correspondence between
these models and Z_{2} x Z_{2} orbifold compactification of the weakly coupled
10-dimensional heterotic string identifies associated Calabi-Yau 3-folds which
possess the structure of the above Z and X. A nonperturbative extension of the
top quark Yukawa coupling is discussed.

1948 when Casimir calculated the force of attraction between parallel uncharged
plates, a phenomenon confirmed experimentally with ever increasing precision.
Casimir himself suggested that a similar attractive self-stress existed for a
conducting spherical shell, but Boyer obtained a repulsive stress. Other
geometries and higher dimensions have been considered over the years. Local
effects, and divergences associated with surfaces and edges have been
investigated by several authors. Quite recently, Graham et al. have re-examined
such calculations, using conventional techniques of perturbative quantum field
theory to remove divergences, and have suggested that previous self-stress
results may be suspect. Here we show that most of the examples considered in
their work are misleading; in particular, it is well-known that in two
dimensions a circular boundary has a divergence in the Casimir energy for
massless fields, while for general dimension $D$ not equal to an even integer
the corresponding Casimir energy arising from massless fields interior and
exterior to a hyperspherical shell is finite. It has also long been recognized
that the Casimir energy for massive fields is divergent for curved boundaries.
These conclusions are reinforced by a calculation of the relevant leading
Feynman diagram in $D$ dimensions. Divergences do occur in third order, as has
been recognized for many years, but this logarithmic divergence is of
questionable relevance to real shells.

quiver of $C$. The dual Gabriel theorem for a coalgebra with separable
coradical is obtained, which generalizes the corresponding result for a pointed
coalgebra. We also give a new description of $C_1$ of any coalgebra $C$, which
can be regarded as a generalization of the first part of the well-known
Taft-Wilson Theorem for pointed coalgebras. As applications, we give a
characterization of locally finite coalgebras via their Gabriel quivers, and a
property of the Gabriel quiver of a quasi-coFrobenius coalgebra.

through a resonant electromagnetic field. In the absence of the OL, we find

states generate periodic oscillations between the two condensate components,
which is possible only because of the linear coupling between them. We also
find four-mode states, but they are always unstable. Finally, we briefly

limits to information transmission have revealed questions such as the
possibility of superluminal data transfer or not; and whether reversible
computation (information processing) is feasible. In some respects these
uncertainties stem from the determination of whether information is inherent in
points of non-analyticity (discontinuities) or smoother functions. The close
relationship between information and entropy is also well known, e.g.
Brillouin's concept of negentropy (negative entropy) as a measure for
information. Since the leading edge of a step-discontinuity propagates in any
dispersive medium at the speed of light in vacuum as a precursor to the main
body of the dispersed pulse, we propose in this paper to treat information as
being intrinsic to points of non-analyticity (discontinuities). This allows us
to construct a theory addressing these dilemmas in a fashion consistent with
causality, and the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. A consequence of our
proposition is that the movement of information is always associated with the
dissipation of heat, and therefore that the concept of reversible classical
computation is not tenable.

webs from a variety of environments. We first perform a theoretical analysis of
the niche model of Williams and Martinez. We derive analytical expressions for
the distributions of species' number of prey, number of predators, and total
number of trophic links and find that they follow universal functional forms.
We also derive expressions for a number of other biologically relevant
parameters, including the fraction of top, intermediate, basal, and cannibal
species, the standard deviations of generality and vulnerability, the
correlation coefficient between species' number of prey and number of
predators, and assortativity. We show that our findings are robust under rather
general conditions. We then use our analytical predictions as a guide to the
analysis of fifteen of the most complete empirical food webs available. We
uncover quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the
model food webs and most of the trophic webs considered. Our results support a
strong new hypothesis that the empirical distributions of number of prey and
number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free
parameters, match our analytical predictions. Further, we find that the
empirically observed correlation coefficient, assortativity, and fraction of
cannibal species are consistent with our analytical expressions and simulations
of the niche model. Finally, we show that the average distance between nodes
and the average clustering coefficient show a high degree of regularity for
both the empirical data and simulations of the niche model. Our findings
suggest that statistical physics concepts such as scaling and universality may
be useful in the description of natural ecosystems.

experiments from the viewpoint of Bohmian mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics
particles with exactly opposite momenta will move in opposite directions. In
addition it will prove particularly usefull to use Bohmian mechanics because
