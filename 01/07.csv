hot accretion disc models: advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and
recently found luminous hot accretion flow (LHAF). We solve for the global
solution of both ADAF and LHAF to obtain the electron temperature, $T_{\rm e}$,
and Thompson optical depth, $\tau$, at the radius where most of the radiation
comes from. We adopt two kinds of electron energy equations. In one, only
synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation and their Comptonization are
considered. The other is parameterized by a constant Compton parameter to model
the case in which thermal Comptonization of external soft photon is important.
We compare the calculated $T_{\rm e}$ and $\tau$ with the observational values
obtained by fitting the average spectra of Seyfert-1 galaxies and black-hole
binaries using thermal Comptonization model. We find that the most favoured
model is an LHAF with parameterized electron energy equation, with ADAFs
predicting too high $T_{\rm e}$.

a turbulent molecular cloud, we evaluate the relevant contributions of
fragmentation and competitive accretion in determining the masses of the more
massive stars. We find no correlation between the final mass of a massive star,
and the mass of the clump from which it forms. Instead, we find that the bulk
of the mass of massive stars comes from subsequent competitive accretion in a
clustered environment. In fact, the majority of this mass infalls onto a
pre-existing stellar cluster. Furthermore, the mass of the most massive star in
a system increases as the system grows in numbers of stars and in total mass.
This arises as the infalling gas is accompanied by newly formed stars,
resulting in a larger cluster around a more massive star. High-mass stars gain
mass as they gain companions, implying a direct causal relationship between the
cluster formation process, and the formation of higher-mass stars therein.

frequencies between 430 and 2380 MHz. We used a CLEAN-based algorithm to
deconvolve interstellar pulse broadening from the measured pulse shapes. We
employed two distinct pulse broadening functions (PBFs): PBF$_1$ is appropriate
for a thin screen of scattering material between the Earth and a pulsar, while
PBF$_2$ is appropriate for scattering material uniformly distributed along the
line of sight from the Earth to a pulsar. We found that some observations were
better fit by PBF$_1$ and some by PBF$_2$. Pulse broadening times ($\tau_d$)
are derived from fits of PBFs to the data, and are compared with the
predictions of a smoothed model of the Galactic electron distribution. Several
lines of sight show excess broadening, which we model as clumps of high density
scattering material. A global analysis of all available data finds that the
pulse broadening scales with frequency, $\nu$, as $\taud \propto\nu^{-\alpha}$
where $\alpha\sim 3.9\pm 0.2$. This is somewhat shallower than the value
$\alpha=4.4$ expected from a Kolmogorov medium, but could arise if the spectrum
of turbulence has an inner cutoff at $\sim $300--800 km. A few objects follow
particularly shallow scaling laws (the mean scaling index $\meanalpha \sim 3.1

exit and compared it with a dense set of photometric observations obtained by

CasA, and reported the detection of 2-4 M_sun of cold, 18K, dust in the
remnant. Here we show that their interpretation of the observations faces
serious difficulties. Their inferred dust mass is larger than the mass of
refractory material in the ejecta of a 10 to 30 M_sun star. The cold dust model
faces even more difficulties if the 170 micron observations of the remnant are
included in the analysis, decreasing the cold dust temperature to ~ 8K, and
increasing its mass to > 20 M_sun. We offer here a more plausible
interpretation of their observation, in which the cold dust emission is
generated by conducting needles with properties that are completely determined
by the combined submillimeter and X-ray observations of the remnant. The
needles consist of metallic whiskers with <1% of embedded impurities that may
have condensed out of blobs of material that were expelled at high velocities
from the inner metal-rich layers of the star in an asymmetric explosion. The
needles are collisionally heated by the shocked gas to a temperature of 8K.
Taking the destruction of needles into account, a dust mass of only 1E-4 to
1E-3M_sun is needed to account for the observed SCUBA emission. Aligned in the
magnetic field, needles may give rise to observable polarized emission. The
detection of submillimeter polarization will therefore offer definitive proof
for a needle origin for the cold dust emission. Supernovae may still be proven
to be important sources of interstellar dust, but the evidence is still
inconclusive.

  Transition in a Dimer Model as a Paragidm of a Molecular Glass","36 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.72.011102","UATP0401","cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  We discuss the need for discretization to evaluate the configurational
entropy in a general model. We also discuss the prescription using restricted
partition function formalism to study the stationary limit of metastable
states. We introduce a lattice model of dimers as a paradigm of molecular fluid
and study metastability in it to investigate the root cause of glassy behavior.
We demonstrate the existence of the entropy crisis in metastable states, from
which it follows that the entropy crisis is the root cause underlying the ideal
glass transition in systems with particles of all sizes. The orientational
interactions in the model control the nature of the liquid-liquid transition
observed in recent years in molecular glasses.

rarefaction pulses -- in condensates: by the process of strongly nonequilibrium

depletion of the condensate density by a laser beam, and by moving a small
object with supercritical velocities. Perturbations created by such waves
colliding with vortices are studied in the context of the Gross-Pitaevskii

mechanisms: the creation of vortex line as rarefaction waves acquire
circulation in a vicinity of a vortex core and the loss of the vortex line to
sound due to Kelvin waves that are generated on vortex lines by rarefaction
pulses. When a vortex ring collides with a rarefaction wave, the ring either
stabilises to a smaller ring after emitting sound through Kelvin wave radiation
or the entire energy of the vortex ring is lost to sound if the radius of the
ring is of the order of the healing length. We show that during the time
evolution of a tangle of vortices, the interactions with rarefaction pulses
provide an important dissipation mechanism enhancing the decay of superfluid

  Normal N-body systems relax to equilibrium distributions in which classical

inverse cubic repulsion together with a linear (simple harmonic) attraction,
the system pulsates for ever. In spite of this pulsation in scale, r(t), other

has dramatic consequences in scenarios with large CP-mixing effects in the

$M_{\tilde{g}}\mu$ is $\sim 180^{\rm o} \pm 30^{\rm o}$, the lightest-sbottom
squark becomes tachyonic and, possibly, the $b$-quark Yukawa coupling
nonperturbative for values of $\tan \beta$ ranging from intermediate up to

for the production of the three neutral-Higgs bosons through $b$-quark have
rather interesting dependences on $arg(A_t\mu)$ and $arg(A_b\mu)$, and the

production channel cannot be neglected with respect to the production through
gluon fusion. For large CP-mixing effects, the lightest neutral-Higgs boson can
be mainly CP odd and the $b$-quark fusion becomes its main production
mechanism. Searches at the Tevatron and the LHC can easily detect such a Higgs

Neutrino masses and mixings are consistent with the observational data for

inverted or degenerate. For the latter type of spectra the parameter M_{ee}
probed in double beta experiments and the mass parameter probed by cosmology
