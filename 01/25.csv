pass very restrictive weak field tests of gravity and yet exhibit
non-perturbative strong field deviations away from General Relativity. This
phenomenon was called `Spontaneous Scalarization' and causes the (Einstein
frame) scalar field inside a neutron star to rapidly become inhomogeneous once
the star's mass increases above some critical value. For a star whose mass is
below the threshold, the field is instead nearly uniform (a state which
minimises the star's energy) and the configuration is similar to the General
Relativity one. Here, we show that the spontaneous scalarization phenomenon is
linked to another strong field effect: a spontaneous violation of the weak
energy condition.

normally incoherent light without any blurring of the images or altering the
order of the spectra. CREIL operates in gases having quadrupolar resonances in
the megaherz range, and it is easily confused with Doppler effects. When CREIL
is taken into account, the propagation of light in cosmic low pressure gases
involves a complex combination of absorptions and frequency shifts. Current
star theory predicts very bright accreting neutron stars. These should be
small, very hot objects surrounded by dirty atomic hydrogen. CREIL predicts
spectra for these stars that have exactly the characteristics found in the
spectra of the quasars. The intrinsic redshifting in the extended photosphere
of Quasars as defined by CREIL events drastically reduces both the size and
distance to quasars, and clearly identifies the missing neutron stars as
quasar-like objects. A full interpretation of quasar spectra does not require
jets, dark matter, a variation of the fine structure constant, or an early
synthesis of iron. CREIL is useful in explaining other astrophysical problems,
such as redshifting proportional to the path of light through the corona of the
Sun. CREIL radiation transfers may explain the blueshifting of radio signals
from Pioneer 10 and 11.

temperature T was slowly varied at the rate 0.1 K/s. Polarized PZT layers
generate a pyroelectric current as the temperature changes. The main indicator
of pyroelectric nature of the current is the sign reversal when the thermal

varied in a wide range. (i) For NFO1-PZT system the coefficient was in the
range 0.01 - 10 nC/(cm2 K), depending on the temperature. (ii) CFO-PZT and

temperature range from the room temperature to 400 K. (iv) In LSM-PZT, the
thermal current exceeded the pyroelectric current. A model is proposed for an

suppress synaptic transmission for seconds to minutes when fully engaged. This
effectively alters the synaptic strength of a connection. Much work on
neuromodulation has rested on the assumption that these effects are uniform at
every neuron. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that
presynaptic regulation may be in effect synapse-specific. This would define a
second ""weight modulation"" matrix, which reflects presynaptic receptor efficacy
at a given site. Here we explore functional consequences of this hypothesis. By
analyzing and comparing the weight matrices of networks trained on different
aspects of a task, we identify the potential for a low complexity ""modulation
matrix"", which allows to switch between differently trained subtasks while
retaining general performance characteristics for the task. This means that a
given network can adapt itself to different task demands by regulating its
release of neuromodulators. Specifically, we suggest that (a) a network can
provide optimized responses for related classification tasks without the need
to train entirely separate networks and (b) a network can blend a ""memory mode""
which aims at reproducing memorized patterns and a ""novelty mode"" which aims to
facilitate classification of new patterns. We relate this work to the known
effects of neuromodulators on brain-state dependent processing.

Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) and Chern-Simons (CS) supergravity theories in the
Hamiltonian framework: 1) The two-dimensional super WZW model coupled to
supergravity is constructed. The canonical representation of Kac-Moody algebra
is extended to the super Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras. Then, the canonical
action is constructed, invariant under local supersymmetry transformations. The
metric tensor and Rarita-Schwinger fields emerge as Lagrange multipliers of the
components of the super energy-momentum tensor. 2) In higher dimensions, CS
theories are irregular systems, that is, they have constraints which are
functionally dependent in some sectors of phase space. In these cases, the
standard Dirac procedure must be redefined, as it is shown in the simplified
case of finite number of degrees of freedom. Irregular systems fall into two
classes depending on their behavior in the vicinity of the constraint surface.
In one case, it is possible to regularize the system without ambiguities, while
in the other, regularization is not always possible and the Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian descriptions may be dynamically inequivalent. Irregularities have
important consequences in the linearized approximation of nonlinear theories.
3) The dynamics of CS supergravity theory in D=5, based on the supersymmetric
extension of the AdS algebra, su(2,2|4), is analyzed. A class of backgrounds is
found, providing a regular and generic effective theory. Some of these
backgrounds are shown to be BPS states. The charges for the simplest choice of
asymptotic conditions are obtained, and they satisfy a supersymmetric extension
of the classical WZW(4) algebra, associated to su(2,2|4).

area spectrum for the Kerr and extremal Kerr black holes. The real part of the
quasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole used for this computation is of the
form $m\Omega$ where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the black hole
horizon. The resulting spectrum is discrete but not as expected uniformly
spaced. Thus, we infer that the function describing the real part of
quasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole is not the correct one. This
conclusion is in agreement with the numerical results for the highly damped
quasinormal modes of Kerr black hole recently presented by Berti, Cardoso and
Yoshida. On the contrary, extremal Kerr black hole is shown to have a discrete
area spectrum which in addition is evenly spaced. The area spacing derived in
our analysis for the extremal Kerr black hole area spectrum is not proportional
to $\ln 3$. Therefore, it does not give support to Hod's statement that the
area spectrum $A_{n}=(4l^{2}_{p}ln 3)n$ should be valid for a generic

equations have been considered by some authors. Several interpretations have
been formulated for this magnetic spacetime. Up to now this solution has been
considered as a two--parameter self--consistent field. We point out that the
parameter related to the mass of this solution is just a pure gauge and can be
rescaled to minus one. This implies that the magnetic metric has really a
simple form and it is effectively one-parameter solution, which describes a
distribution of a radial magnetic field in a 2+1 anti--de Sitter background
space--time. We consider an alternative interpretation to the Dias--Lemos one
for the magnetic field source.

shown to arise naturally from the expectation that the Schwartz space on the

of the latter by the canonical automorphisms of orders three and six (which
does in fact happen and is shown here).

states that has the greatest probability of ocurring in the Markov chain. We
divide the space of all Markov chains into Viterbi regions in which two Markov
chains are in the same region if they have the same set of Viterbi paths. The
Viterbi paths of regions of positive measure are called Viterbi sequences. Our
main results are (1) each Viterbi sequence can be divided into a prefix,
periodic interior, and suffix, and (2) as n increases to infinity (and the
number of states remains fixed), the number of Viterbi regions remains bounded.
The Viterbi regions correspond to the vertices of a Newton polytope of a
polynomial whose terms are the probabilities of sequences of length n. We
characterize Viterbi sequences and polytopes for two- and three-state Markov
chains.

physics. Later tiltmeter studies demonstrated the usefulness of autocorrelation
for the routine study of these normally short-lived eigenmodes. More recent
studies suggest that many tilt-sensitive instruments are capable of observing
these oscillations--if the low-frequency response of their electronics is not
suppressed, as is customary with conventional designs.

Ants confined into a cell with two symmetrically located exits use both exits
in approximately equal proportions to abandon the cell in normal conditions,
but prefer one of the exits if panic is created by adding a repellent fluid.
This finding is consistent with the predictions of recent theoretical models
for the escape of humans in panic conditions, indicating that some features of
the collective behaviour of humans and ants can be similar when escaping under
panic.
