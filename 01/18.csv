reasonable agreement with the predicted contribution from type Ia supernovae
(SNIa). But the characteristic features in the SNIa gamma ray spectrum,
weakened by integration over source redshifts, are hard to measure, and
additionally the contributions from other sources in the MeV range are
uncertain, so that the SNIa origin of the MeV CGB remains unproven. Since
different CGB sources have different clustering properties and redshift
distributions, by combining the CGB spectrum and angular correlation
measurements, the contributions to the CGB could be identified and separated.
The SNIa CGB large-scale structure follows that of galaxies. Its rms
fluctuation at degree scales has a characteristic energy dependence, ranging
from $\sim 1%$ to order of unity and can be measured to several percent
precision by proposed future satellites such as the Advanced Compton Telescope.
With the identification of the SNIa contribution, the SNIa rate could be
measured unambiguously as a function of redshift up to $z \sim 1$, by combining
both the spectrum and angular correlation measurements, yielding new
constraints on the star formation rate to even higher redshifts. Finally, we
show that the gamma ray and neutrino backgrounds from supernovae should be
closely connected, allowing an important consistency test from the measured
data. Identification of the astrophysical contributions to the CGB would allow
much greater sensitivity to an isotropic high-redshift CGB contribution arising
in extra dimension or dark matter models.

  Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), and Flare/CME Model of Gamma-ray Bursts","12 pages, 2 figures; submitted to ApJ Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigated the statistical distributions of physical quantities of solar
flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We found that the
distributions of the X-ray peak fluxes of CME-related flares, their time
intervals, and speeds of associated CMEs are in good agreement with log-normal
distributions. One possible interpretation of this is that only large energetic
mass ejections can escape from the solar corona, which become CMEs in the
interplanetary space. This ``filtering effect'' may be the reason why
statistical distributions of some physical quantities are similar to log-normal
distribution. It is known that the distributions of several physical quantities
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are also log-normal distributions, and that the time
variations of gamma-ray intensity in GRBs are very similar to those of hard
X-rays of solar flares. On the basis of these similarities and physical
consideration of magnetohydrodynamic properties of an accretion disk around a
black hole, which is supposed to be situated in the central engine of a GRB, we
propose a new model of the central engine of GRBs, the {\it flare/CME model},
in which GRBs are formed by nonsteady jets consisting of intermittent ejections
of mass (like solar CMEs) associated with reconnection events (like solar
flares) in the accretion disk corona. Such nonsteady MHD jets would produce
many shocks as well as local reconnection events far from the central engine.
In this model, only large energetic mass ejections can escape from the
accretion disk corona, so that statistical distributions of some physical
quantities are similar to log-normal distributions.

addition to redshifts and associated quality assessments, our catalog also
includes photometric and astrometric measurements for all targets detected in
our R-band imaging survey of the GOODS-North region. We investigate various
sources of incompleteness and find the redshift catalog to be 53% complete at
its limiting magnitude. The median redshift of z=0.65 is lower than in similar
deep surveys because we did not select against low-redshift targets. Comparison
with other redshift surveys in the same field, including a complementary
Hawaii-led DEIMOS survey, establishes that our velocity uncertainties are as
low as 40 km/s for red galaxies and that our redshift confidence assessments
are accurate. The distributions of rest-frame magnitudes and colors among the
sample agree well with model predictions out to and beyond z=1. We will release
all survey data, including extracted 1-D and sky-subtracted 2-D spectra, thus
providing a sizable and homogeneous database for the GOODS-North field which
