The model combines the computational advantages of local cartesian geometry
with the ability to include a shear profile that resembles the sun's
differential rotation at low latitudes. It is shown that in a two-dimensional
mean field model this geometry produces cyclic solutions with dynamo waves
traveling away from the equator -- as expected for a positive alpha effect in
the northern hemisphere. In three dimensions with turbulence driven by a
helical forcing function, an alpha effect is self-consistently generated in the
presence of a finite imposed toroidal magnetic field. The results suggest that,
due to a finite flux of current helicity out of the domain, alpha quenching
appears to be non-catastrophic -- at least for intermediate values of the
magnetic Reynolds number. For larger values of the magnetic Reynolds number,
however, there is evidence for a reversal of the trend and that $\alpha$ may
decrease with increasing magnetic Reynolds number. Control experiments with
closed boundaries confirm that in the absence of a current helicity flux, but
with shear as before, alpha quenching is always catastrophic and alpha
decreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. For solar
parameters, our results suggest a current helicity flux of about 0.001 G^2/s.
This corresponds to a magnetic helicity flux, integrated over the northern
hemisphere and over the 11 year solar cycle, of about 10^{46}Mx^2.

dissipative jet flow, which is only mildly relativistic with a speed of 0.60 c.
We can also estimate that the shock waves form in the jet at a distance of
about 1 AU from the black hole.

the cross talk here appears as an additive component. Analysis of the
characteristics of this cross talk leads us to believe that when these

antenna pair pick up correlated emission from opposite sides of the main
reflector surface of the front antenna. The slots between the panels that make
up the main reflector surface provide the pathway for the coupling across the
reflector surface. This mode of cross talk may be avoided by constructing the
main reflectors of short spacing interferometers as continuous conducting
surfaces.

is an intermediate polar with a 5.7-h orbital period. V4742 Sgr is a recent
nova with no known periods. CCD unfiltered continuous photometry of these 2
objects was carried out during 56 nights in 2002-3. In TX Col, in addition to
the orbital period of 5.7 h, we found peaks at 7.1 h and 5.0 h. These are
interpreted as positive and negative superhumps correspondingly, although the
effects of the quasi-periodic oscillations at about 2 h were not taken into
consideration. In the light curve of V4742 Sgr 2 long periods are detected --
6.1 and 5.4 h as well as a short-term period at 1.6 h. This result suggests
that V4742 Sgr is an intermediate polar candidate and a permanent superhump
system with a large orbital period (5.4 h) and a superhump period excess of 13
percent. If these results are confirmed, TX Col, V4742 Sgr and TV Col form a
group of intermediate polars with extremely large superhump periods. There
seems to be now growing evidence that superhumps can occur in intermediate
polars with long orbital periods, which is very likely inconsistent with the
theoretical prediction that superhumps can only occur in systems with mass
ratios below 0.33. Alternatively, if the mass ratio in these systems is
nevertheless below the theoretical limit, they should harbour undermassive
secondaries and massive white dwarfs, near the Chandrasekhar limit, which would
make them excellent candidates for progenitors of supernovae type Ia.

periodic gaps in the light curves introduced by the Earth occultation every

over timescales of hours can not be the spurious result of periodic gaps, while
periodic gaps indeed introduces uncertainty larger than what present in the
evenly sampled data. The results also show that time lag estimates can be
substantially improved by using evenly sampled light curves with large lag to
bin-size ratio. Furthermore, we consider an XMM-Newton observation without
interruptions and re-sample the light curves using the BeppoSAX observing
windows, and then repeat the same cross correlation function (CCF) analysis on
both the real and fake data. The results also show that periodic gaps in the
light curves do not significantly distort the CCF characters, and indeed the
CCF peak ranges of the real and fake data overlap. Therefore, the lags

h^{-2}L/Lsun < 10^{12.5}. From our optical spectroscopy campaigns of the
northern ELAIS 90 mircon survey (7.4 deg^2 in total, to S(90um)>70mJy), we
obtained redshifts for 61% of the sample (151 redshifts) to B<21 identified at
7 microns, 15 microns, 20cm or with bright (B<18.5) optical identifications.
The selection function is well-defined, permitting the construction of the 90
micron luminosity function of the Final Analysis catalogue in the ELAIS
northern fields, which is in excellent agreement with our Preliminary Analysis
luminosity function in the ELAIS S1 field from paper IV. The luminosity
function is also in good agreement with the IRAS-based prediction of Serjeant &
Harrison (2004), which if correct requires luminosity evolution of (1+z)^{3.4
+/- 1.0} for consistency with the source counts. This implies an evolution in
comoving volume averaged star formation rate at z<~1 consistent with that
derived from rest-frame optical and ultraviolet surveys.

relativistic phenomena in the Universe. They are associated with supermassive
black holes in distant active galactic nuclei (AGN), accreting black holes and
neutron stars in binary systems and are believed to be responsible for
gamma-ray bursts. The physics of these jets,however, remains something of a
mystery in that their bulk velocities, compositions and energetics remain
poorly determined. Here we report the discovery of an ultra-relativistic
outflow from a binary accreting neutron star accreting gas within a binary
system. The velocity of the outflow is comparable to the fastest-moving flows
observed from active galactic nuclei, and its strength is modulated by the rate
of accretion of material onto the neutron star. Shocks are energized further
downstream in the flow, which are themselves moving with mildly relativistic
bulk velocities and are the sites of the observed synchrotron emission from the
jet. We conclude that the generation of such highly relativistic outflows does
not require properties unique to black holes, such as an event horizon.

He II changed from ~700 km/s to 1300 km/s, and one of the peaks dominated over
an orbital period in the genuine-superhump era, but the dominant peak

First, we compare the mass accretion history at z>0 with optical luminosity

of mass accretion (energy conversion efficiency and Eddington ratio) and
conclude that the constraints based on HXLFs are more adequate rather than that
based on OLFs. The sub-Eddington case is allowed only when we use HXLFs. Next,
we estimate the upper limit of the cumulative mass density of SMBHs at any
redshifts. For an application, we examine if Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) at z=3
already have SMBHs in their centers which is suggested by recent observations.
If most of LBGs already has massive SMBHs at z=3, the resultant mass density of
SMBHs at z=0 should exceed the observational estimate because such SMBHs should
further grow by accretion. We show that the special conditions should be met in
order that a large part of LBGs have SMBHs (for example, large energy
conversion efficiency and frequent mergers and/or direct formations at z>3).
The possibility that nearly all LBGs have SMBHs with large mass ratio, such as

previously published result, we find that the presence of extremely broadened
reflection features from an ionized relativistic accretion disk is required
even when one employs the latest X-ray reflection models and includes the
effect of complex absorption. The extremely broadened reflection features are
also present if the primary continuum is modeled with a thermal Comptonisation
spectrum rather than a simple power-law continuum. With this fact established,
we examine these data using a relativistic smearing function corresponding to a
``generalized thin accretion disk'' model. We find strong evidence for torquing
of the central parts of the accretion disk (presumably through magnetic
interactions with the plunging region of the disk and/or the rotating black
hole itself). We also perform a study of spectral variability within our
observation. We find that the disk reflection features maintain roughly a
constant equivalent width with respect to the observed continuum, as predicted
by simple reflection models. Taken together with other studies of MCG-6-30-15
that find disk features to possess constant intensity at higher flux states, we
suggest that the flux of disk features undergoes a saturation once the source
emerges from a Deep Minimum state.

Chandra, though two have faded below the 10^39 erg/s luminosity threshold used
to first designate these sources as ULXs. Using this same criterion, we detect
three further ULXs within the imaged regions of the galaxies. The ULXs appear
to be related to the star forming regions of the galaxies, indicating that even
in ``normal'' spiral galaxies the ULX population is predominantly associated
with young stellar populations. A detailed study of the Chandra ACIS-S spectra
of six of the ULXs shows that five are better described by a powerlaw continuum
than a multi-colour disc blackbody model, though there is evidence for
additional very soft components to two of the powerlaw continua. The measured
photon indices in four out of five cases are consistent with the low/hard state
in black hole binaries, contrary to the suggestion that powerlaw-dominated
spectra of ULXs originate in the very high state. A simple interpretation of
this is that we are observing accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes,
though we might also be observing a spectral state unique to very high mass
accretion rates in stellar-mass black hole systems. Short-term flux variability
is only detected in one of two epochs for two of the ULXs, with the lack of
this characteristic arguing that the X-ray emission of this sample of ULXs is
not dominated by relativistically-beamed jets. The observational
characteristics of this small sample suggest that ULXs are a distinctly
heterogeneous source class.

and the low temperature phase changes from the spin-density wave (SDW) to the
d-wave superconductivity (dSC) and finally, for bad nesting, to the random
antiferromagnetic state (RAF). Both SDW and dSC phases are affected by
disorder. The pair breaking depends on the imperfect nesting and is the most

neutral-ionic transition for \delta = 0 but remains finite for \delta > 0 in
dimerized chains. The Peierls or dimerization mode couples to charge
fluctuations along the stack and results in large vibrational contributions,
\alpha_{vib}, that are related to \partial P/\partial \delta and that peak
sharply at the Peierls transition. The extension of P(F) to correlated
electronic states yields the dielectric response \kappa of models with
neutral-ionic or Peierls transitions, where \kappa peaks >100 are found with
parameters used previously for variable ionicity \rho and vibrational spectra
of CT salts. The calculated \kappa accounts for the dielectric response of CT
salts based on substituted TTFs (tetrathiafulvalene) and substituted CAs
(chloranil). The role of lattice stiffness appears clearly in models: soft
systems have a Peierls instability at small \rho and continuous crossover to
large \rho, while stiff stacks such as TTF-CA have a first-order transition
with discontinuous \rho that is both a neutral-ionic and Peierls transition.
The transitions are associated with tuning the electronic ground state of

approach to the problem. The analysis allows us to deal most efficiently with
the division of space-time into a honeycomb network of cells produced by an
arbitrary arrangement of membranes of matter. We write the gravitational action
as bulk terms plus integrals over each lower dimensional intersection.
  The spin connection is discontinuous at the shared boundaries of the cells,
which are spaces of various dimensionalities. That means that at each
intersection there are more than one spin connections.
  We introduce a multi-parameter family of connections which interpolate
between the different connections at each intersection. The parameters live
naturally on a simplex. We can then write the action including all the
intersection terms in a simple way. The Lagrangian of Lovelock gravity is
generalized so as to live on the simplices as well. Each intersection term of
the action is then obtained as an integral over an appropriate simplex.
  Lovelock gravity and the associated topological (Euler) density are used as
an example of a more general formulation. In this example one finds that
singular sources up to a certain co-dimensionality naturally carry matter
without introducing conical or other singularities in spacetime geometry.

gravitational field strength. The Laser Astrometric Test Of Relativity (LATOR)
mission uses laser interferometry between two micro-spacecraft whose lines of
sight pass close by the Sun to accurately measure deflection of light in the
solar gravity. The key element of the experimental design is a redundant
geometry optical truss provided by a long-baseline (100 m) multi-channel
stellar optical interferometer placed on the International Space Station. The
geometric redundancy enables LATOR to measure the departure from Euclidean
geometry caused by the solar gravity field to a very high accuracy. LATOR will
not only improve the value of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter
gamma to unprecedented levels of accuracy of 1 part in 1e8, it will also reach
ability to measure effects of the next post-Newtonian order (1/c^4) of light
deflection resulting from gravity's intrinsic non-linearity. The solar
quadrupole moment parameter, J2, will be measured with high precision, as well
as a variety of other relativistic. LATOR will lead to very robust advances in
the tests of fundamental physics: this mission could discover a violation or
extension of general relativity, or reveal the presence of an additional long
range interaction in the physical law. There are no analogs to the LATOR
experiment; it is unique and is a natural culmination of solar system gravity
experiments.

to the existence of a minimal size of the extra dimension that is determined by
the mass parameter of the scalar potential. It was proved that imposing

allows for a starred localized extension with the transformation rule, \phi\to

symmetry on noncommutative space. We interpret the gauge theory so obtained in
terms of the gauge fields that in the commutative limit appear naturally and

vector field. The interactions are shown to be very different from those
obtained by assigning a transformation rule of \phi\to U\star\phi or \phi\star

(HPT) results over the last 40 years immediately or with little extra work give
some of the Koszul duality results that have appeared in the last decade.
  Higher homotopies typically arise when a huge object, e. g. a chain complex
defining various invariants of a certain geometric situation, is cut to a small
model, and the higher homotopies can then be dealt with concisely in the
language of sh-structures (strong homotopy structures). This amounts to precise
ways of handling the requisite additional structure encapsulating the various
coherence conditions. Given e. g. two augmented differential graded algebras A
and B, an sh-map from A to B is a twisting cochain from the reduced bar
construction of A to B and, in this manner, the class of morphisms of augmented
differential graded algebras is extended to that of sh-morphisms. In the
present paper, we explore small models for equivariant (co)homology via
differential homological algebra techniques including homological perturbation
theory which, in turn, is a standard tool to handle sh-structures.
  Koszul duality, for a finite type exterior algebra on odd positive degree
generators, then comes down to a duality between the category of sh-modules
over that algebra and that of sh-comodules over its reduced bar construction.
This kind of duality relies on the extended functoriality of the differential
graded Tor-, Ext-, Cotor-, and Coext functors, extended to the appropriate
sh-categories. We construct the small models as certain twisted tensor products
and twisted Hom-objects. These are chain and cochain models for the chains and
cochains on geometric bundles and are compatible with suitable additional
structure.

G-equivariant de Rham cohomology in terms of a suitable relative differential
graded Ext, defined on the appropriate category of (G,Cg)-modules. The meaning
of ""relative"" is made precise via the dual standard construction associated
with the monad involving the aforementioned functor and the associated
forgetful functor. The corresponding infinitesimal equivariant cohomology is
the relative differential Ext over Cg relative to g. The functor under
discussion decomposes into two functors, the functor which determines
differentiable cohomology in the sense of Hochschild-Mostow and the functor
which determines the infinitesimal equivariant theory, suitably interpreted.
This functor decomposition, in turn, entails an extension of a Decomposition
Lemma due to Bott. Appropriate models for the differential graded Ext involving
a comparison between a suitably defined simplicial Weil coalgebra and the Weil
coalgebra dual to the familiar ordinary Weil algebra yield small models for
equivariant de Rham cohomology including the standard Weil and Cartan models
for the special case where the group G is compact and connected. Koszul duality
in de Rham theory results from these considerations in a straightforward

knots are cobordant rel boundary. However, the cobordism rel boundary theory of
odd-dimensional disk knots is more subtle. Generalizing results of Levine on
cobordism of sphere knots, we define disk knot Seifert matrices and show that
two higher-dimensional disk knots with isotopic boundaries are cobordant rel
boundary if and only if their disk knot Seifert matrices are algebraically
cobordant. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions to realize a
Seifert matrix cobordism class among the disk knots corresponding to a fixed
boundary knot, assuming the boundary knot has no middle-dimensional 2-torsion.
This classification is performed by relating the Seifert matrix of a disk knot
to its Blanchfield pairing and by establishing a close connection between this
Blanchfield pairing and the Farber-Levine torsion pairing of the boundary knot
(in fact, for disk knots satisfying certain connectivity assumptions, the disk
knot Blanchfield pairing will determine the boundary Farber-Levine pairing).

compute the pagerank of all the web pages on the Internet: the eigenvector
corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 is the pagerank vector. Due to its huge
dimension, of the order of billions, the (presently) only viable method to
compute the eigenvector is the power method. For the convergence of the

setting of rational homotopy theory via differential graded Lie algebras, we
identify the long exact sequence induced on rational homotopy groups by w in

obtain a unified description of the rational homotopy theory of function
spaces, at the level of rational homotopy groups, in terms of derivations of
Quillen models and adjoints. In particular, as a natural extension of a result
of Tanre, we identify the rationalization of the evaluation subgroups of a map

question of Gottlieb, within the context of rational homotopy theory. We also
identify the rationalization of the G-sequence of f and make explicit
computations of the homology of this sequence. In a separate result of

order with entries {-1,1}. The most general upper bound on the maximal
determinant, due to Barba, can only be achieved when the order is the sum of
two consecutive squares. It is conjectured that the bound is always attained in
such cases. Apart from these, only in orders 3, 7, 9, 11, 17 and 21 has the
maximal value been established. In this paper we confirm the results for these
orders, and add order 15 to the list. We follow previous authors in
exhaustively searching for candidate Gram matrices having determinant greater
than or equal to the square of a known lower bound on the maximum. We then
attempt to decompose each candidate as the product of a {-1,1}-matrix and its
transpose. For order 15 we find four candidates, all of Ehlich block form, two
having determinant (105*3^5*2^14)^2 and the others determinant
(108*3^5*2^14)^2. One of the former decomposes (in an essentially unique way)
while the remaining three do not. This result proves a conjecture made
independently by W. D. Smith and J. H. E. Cohn. We also use our method to
compute improved upper bounds on the maximal determinant in orders 29, 33, and
37, and to establish the range of the determinant function of {-1,1}-matrices
in orders 9 and 11.

extensively at this point the notion of {\em generalized gauge transformation

can see immediately that the parallel transport can be viewed as a generalized

model of hadronic interactions. The photoproduction can be described quite well
over the entire energy range of available data by considering an $S_{11}$ and a
$P_{11}$ resonance, in addition to the $t$-channel mesonic current. The
observed angular distribution is due to the interference between the
$t$-channel and the nucleon resonance $s$- and $u$-channel contributions. Our
analysis yields positions close to 1650 MeV and 1870 MeV for the $S_{11}$ and
$P_{11}$ resonances, respectively. We argue that, at present, identifying these
states with the known $S_{11}(1650)$ resonance and the missing $P_{11}$
resonance predicted at 1880 MeV, respectively, would be premature. It is found
that the nucleonic current is relatively small and that the $NN\eta^\prime$
coupling constant cannot be much larger than $g_{NN\eta^\prime}=3$. As for the
$p p \to p p \eta^\prime$ reaction, different current contributions are
constrained by a combined analysis of this and the photoproduction reaction.
Difficulties to simultaneously account for the 47-MeV and 144-MeV angular
distributions measured by the COSY-11 and DISTO collaborations, respectively,
are addressed.

central Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions relative to scaled $pp$ collisions (the
'kink') is described well by both approaches without involving a phase
transition. However, the maximum in the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio at 20 to 30
A$\cdot$GeV (the 'horn') is missed by $\sim$ 40%. Also, at energies above
$\sim$ 5 A$\cdot$GeV, the measured $K^{\pm}$ $m_{T}$-spectra have a larger
inverse slope than expected from the models. Thus the pressure generated by
hadronic interactions in the transport models at high energies is too low. This
finding suggests that the additional pressure - as expected from lattice QCD at
finite quark chemical potential and temperature - might be generated by strong
interactions in the early pre-hadronic/partonic phase of central heavy-ion
collisions. Finally, we discuss the emergence of density perturbations in a
first-order phase transition and why they might affect relative hadron
multiplicities, collective flow, and hadron mean-free paths at decoupling.

basis of behavior is conducted contains the assumption that brain mechanisms
per se fully suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This
assumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material
particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms must therefore be
formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. One consequence of
this stance is that psychological terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or
experiential content (terms such as ""feeling,"" ""knowing,"" and ""effort"") have
not been included as primary causal factors in neuropsychological research:
insofar as properties are not described in material terms they are deemed
irrelevant to the causal mechanisms underlying brain function. However, the
origin of this demand that experiential realities be excluded from the causal
base is a theory of nature that has been known for more that three quarters of
a century to be fundamentally incorrect. It is explained here why it is
consequently scientifically unwarranted to assume that material factors alone
can in principle explain all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience. More
importantly, it is explained how a key quantum effect can be introduced into
brain dynamics in a simple and practical way that provides a rationally
coherent, causally formulated, physics-based way of understanding and using the

capacity of directed attention and mental effort to systematically alter brain

organisms. Significantly, prokaryotic species display a non-uniform species
distribution approaching the mean of 0.1177 ncDNA/tgDNA (p=1.58 x 10^-13), and
a nonlinear ncDNA/tgDNA relationship to genome size (r=0.15). Importantly, the
ncDNA/tgDNA ratio corrects for ploidy, and is not substantially affected by
variable loads of repetitive sequences. Conclusions: We suggest that the
observed noncoding DNA increases and compositional patterns are primarily a
function of increased information content. It is therefore possible that
introns, intergenic sequences, repeat elements, and genomic DNA previously
regarded as genetically inert may be far more important to the evolution and
functional repertoire of complex organisms than has been previously
appreciated.

describe some specific features of the helix-coil transition in such molecule.
The Hamiltonian of ccDNA is related to the one introduced earlier for the
linear DNA. The basic assumption is that the reduced energy of the hydrogen
bond is not constant through the transition process but depends effectively on
the fraction of already broken bonds. A transformation formula is obtained
which relates the temperature of ccDNA at a given degree of helicity during the
transition to the temperature of the corresponding linear chain at the same
degree of helicity. The formula provides a simple method to calculate the
melting curve for the ccDNA from the experimental melting curve of the linear
DNA with the same nucleotide sequence.
