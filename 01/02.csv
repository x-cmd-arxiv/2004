There is a very good agreement with deuterium observed in cosmological clouds,
which strengthens the confidence on the estimated baryonic density of the
Universe. However, there is an important discrepancy between the deduced 7Li
abundance and the one observed in halo stars of our Galaxy, supposed, until
now, to represent the primordial abundance of this isotope. The origin of this
discrepancy, observational, nuclear or more fundamental remains to be
clarified. The possible role of the up to now neglected 7Be(d,p)2\alpha and

are complex functions of discrete variable. As a concrete example we develop a
discrete analog of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, using the
dependence of the Wigner functions in terms of Kravchuk polynomials. In this
model the position operator has a discrete spectrum given by one index of the
Wigner functions, in the same way that the energy eigenvalues are given by the
other matricial index. Similar picture can be made for other models where the
differential equation and their solutions correspond to the continuous limit of
some difference operator and orthogonal polynomial of discrete variable.

perfectly if it is necessary. That the final states of environment are
completely determined by the initial states of the system allows that an easure

Therefore, the erased information can be recoverd. When there is an
irreversible process, e.g. an irreversible operation or a decoherence process,
in the erasure process, the information would be erased perpetually. We present
that quantum erasure will also give heat dissipation in environment. And a
classical limit of quantum erasure is given which coincides with Landauer's
erasure principle.
