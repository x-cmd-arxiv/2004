  Observing and Mining the Universe"", Sorrento, Sept. 2003",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the possible impact of astrophysical foregrounds on three recent
exciting results of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments: the WMAP
measurements of the temperature-polarization (TE) correlation power spectrum,
the detection of CMB polarization fluctuations on degree scales by the DASI
experiment, and the excess power on arcminute scales reported by the CBI and
BIMA groups. A big contribution from the Galactic synchrotron emission to the
TE power spectrum on large angular scales is indeed expected, in the lower
frequency WMAP channels, based on current, albeit very uncertain, models; at
higher frequencies the rapid decrease of the synchrotron signal may be, to some
extent, compensated by polarized dust emission. Recent measurements of
polarization properties of extragalactic radio sources at high radio frequency
indicate that their contamination of the CMB polarization on degree scales at
30 GHz is substantially below the expected CMB E-mode amplitude. Adding the
synchrotron contribution, we estimate that the overall foreground contamination
of the signal detected by DASI may be significant but not dominant. The excess
power on arc-min scales detected by the BIMA experiment may be due to
galactic-scale Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, if the proto-galactic gas is heated
to its virial temperature and its cooling time is comparable to the Hubble time
at the epoch of galaxy formation. A substantial contamination by radio sources
of the signal reported by the CBI group on scales somewhat larger than BIMA's
cannot be easily ruled out.

continuum provides a much better fit to the soft X-ray spectrum than a single
temperature or disk blackbody plus power law. The emission line profiles,
computed for a Kerr metric around a maximally rotating black hole, reveal a
sharply peaked disk emissivity law and inner radius smaller than 1.7 R_G. The
spectrum also includes narrow absorption and emission lines from C, N, O, Ne,
and Fe in an ionized outflow. Outflow column densities are relatively low and
do not create significant edges in the spectrum. The small amount of absorption
bolsters confidence in the detection of relativistic emission line features.
The narrow-line emitter has a large (76%) global covering fraction, leading to
strong forbidden lines and filling in of the resonance absorption lines. We
also find broad C VI Ly-alpha and very broad O VII emission from the broad-line
region. The narrow and broad-line regions span large ranges in ionization
parameter, and may arise in a disk outflow. The ionized absorber has a large
ionization range which is inconsistent with pressure equilibrium in a
multiphase medium. The mass outflow rate exceeds the accretion rate by a factor
of one thousand.

spin temperature, we investigate in detail its evolution in the presence of HI
fluctuations. For the optical depth, we find that it is affected by density
perturbations both directly and through peculiar velocities which move the
absorption features around in frequency. The latter effect, which has not been
included in earlier studies, is similar to the redshift space distortion seen
in galaxy surveys and this can cause changes of 50% or more in the birghtness

components: a black body and a hard Comptonized tail. These components have
very different angular distribution: the black body peaks along the slab normal

-> 5_05 and 5_05 -> 6_16 transitions. The heat sink is realized by absorbing
the 45 mum photons, corresponding to the 5_23 -> 4_14 transition, by cold dust.
We compute the inversion of maser level populations in the optically thick
medium as a function of the hydrogen concentration, the gas-to-dust mass ratio,
and the difference between the gas and the dust temperatures. The main results
of numerical simulations are interpreted in terms of a simplified four-level
model. We show that the maser strength depends mostly on the product of
hydrogen concentration and the dust-to-water mass ratio but not on the size
distribution of the dust particles or their type. We also suggest approximate
formulae that describe accurately the inversion and can be used for fast
calculations of the maser luminosity. Depending on the gas temperature, the
maximum maser luminosity is reached when the water concentration N_water ~
10^6-10^7 cm^-3 times the dust-to-hydrogen mass ratio, and the inversion
completely disappears at density just an order of magnitude larger. For the
dust temperature of 130 K, the 6_16 -> 5_23 transition becomes inverted already
at the temperature difference of Delta T ~1 K, while other possible masing
transitions require a larger Delta T > 30 K. We identify the region of the

occurrence of major flares that last for months. On a few occasions, the source
was intensively monitored with the more sensitive pointing instruments aboard
RXTE. The data from these observations shows the presence of X-ray flares of
much shorter durations, ranging from weeks down to less than an hour. For the
first time, we clearly resolved the sub-hour flares from Mrk 421. Moreover,
Fourier analyses reveal variability on even shorter timescales, up to about
0.01 Hz. The source appears to behave differently in its spectral properties
during different flares, large or small, which is intriguing. While significant
hysteresis is observed to be associated with spectral evolution in some cases,
little is seen in other cases. Sometimes, the shape of the X-ray spectrum
hardly varies across a flare. Therefore, the phenomenology is complex. The
observed hierarchical structure of the X-ray flares seems to imply the
scale-invariant nature of the phenomenon, perhaps similar to solar flares or
rapid X-ray flares observed of stellar-mass black holes in this regard.
Combined with other results, the observed flaring timescales seriously
constrain the physical properties of X-ray emitting regions in the jets of Mrk

population synthesis technique. Results from the latest, detailed models for
BDs have been incorporated into the population synthesis code. For our models,
we find that ZACVs with BD secondaries have orbital periods in the range 46 min
to 2.5 hrs. We also find that ZACVs with BD secondaries comprise 18% of the
total, present-day ZACV population. In addition, we find that 80% of ZACVs with
BD secondaries have orbital periods < 78 minutes. This implies that 15% of the
present-day ZACV population should have orbital periods shorter than the
observed orbital period minimum for CVs. We also investigate the dependence of
the present-day formation rate of CVs with BD secondaries on the assumed value
of the common envelope efficiency parameter, alpha_CE, for three different
assumed mass ratio distributions in ZAMS binaries. Surprisingly, we find that
the common envelope process must be extremely inefficient (alpha_CE < 0.1) in
order for CVs with BD secondaries not to be formed. Finally, we find that the
progenitor binaries of ZACVs with BD secondaries have ZAMS orbital separations
< 3 AU and ZAMS primary masses between ~1-10 M_sun, with ~75% of the primary
masses less than ~1.6 M_sun. Interestingly, these ranges in orbital separation

4.2+/-0.1x10^-13 and 1.8+/-0.1x10^-13 erg/cm^2/s respectively, decaying very
slowly according to a power-law with an index of -0.55+/-0.05. The prompt soft
X-ray flux, inferred from a detection of the dust echo of the prompt emission,
strongly implies that this burst is very soft and should be classified as an
X-ray flash (XRF) and further, implies a steep temporal slope (<~-1.7) between
the prompt and afterglow phases or in the early afterglow, very different from
the later afterglow decay slope. A power-law (Gamma=1.90+/-0.05) with

the afterglow spectrum well. A bright, low-redshift (z=0.105) galaxy lies

this redshift, GRB031203 is the closest GRB or XRF known after GRB980425. It
has a very low equivalent isotropic gamma-ray energy in the burst (~3x10^49

orders of magnitude less than typical bursts, though higher than either the

consistent with the low X-ray continuum flux level of Mrk 279 at the time of
the observation. Due to low signal-to-noise ratios in the Chandra spectrum, no
O VII or O VIII absorption features are observable in the Chandra data, but the
UV spectra reveal strong and complex absorption from HI and high-ionization
species such as O VI, N V, and C IV, as well as from low-ionization species
such as C III, N III, C II, and N II in some velocity components. The far-UV
spectral coverage of the FUSE data provides information on high-order Lyman
series absorption, which we use to calculate the optical depths and line and
continuum covering fractions in the intrinsic HI absorbing gas in a
self-consistent fashion. The UV continuum flux of Mrk 279 decreases by a factor
of ~7.5 over the time spanning these observations and we discuss the
implications of the response of the absorption features to this change. From
arguments based on the velocities, profile shapes, covering fractions and
variability of the UV absorption, we conclude that some of the absorption
components, particularly those showing prominent low-ionization lines, are
likely associated with the host galaxy of Mrk 279, and possibly with its

the thick disk but should be confirmed with a larger sample. Finally we have
identified 2 new candidates of the HR1614 moving group.

Nevertheless, even the modest far-IR and submillimeter observations obtained in

further underscored the scientific necessity of observations in this wavelength

case of a repulsive pairwise interaction. The low-density (dilution) expansions
for the kinetic and interaction energies of the system in question are
calculated up to the third order in the dilution parameter. Similar to the
recent results for a Bose gas, the calculated quantities turn out to depend on
a pairwise interaction through the two characteristic lengths: the former, $a$,
is the well-known s-wave scattering length, and the latter, $b$, is related to
$a$ by $b=a-m (\partial a/\partial m)$, where $m$ stands for the fermion mass.
To take control of the results, calculations are fulfilled in two independent
ways. The first involves the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, taken in conjunction
with a helpful variational theorem for the scattering length. This way is used
to derive the kinetic and interaction energies from the familiar low-density
expansion of the total system energy first found by Huang and Yang. The second

the quantities of interest``from the scratch'', with no use of the total

interaction of fermions makes an essential contribution to their kinetic
energy. Moreover, there is a complicated and interesting interplay of these

devoted to show that the inflationary scenario provides a valuable dynamical
``bridge'' between a generic Kasner-like regime and a homogeneous and isotropic
Universe in the horizon scale. This result is achieved by solving the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a Bianchi IX model in the presence of a
cosmological space-dependent term. In this respect, we construct a
quasi-isotropic inflationary solution based on the expansion of the Einstein
equations up to first-two orders of approximation, in which the isotropy of the
Universe is due to the dominance of the scalar field kinetic term; the first
order of approximation corresponds to the inhomogeneous corrections and is
driven by the matter evolution. We show how such a quasi-isotropic solution

impossibility for the classical origin of density perturbations, due to the

supersymmetric particles can be observed as resonances even if they are heavier
than the top quark due to the significant off-shell top-quark mass effects. The
approach where the top quark is produced on-mass-shell and then decays into 2-

distributions and rates. The rates of the 2 -> 4 process with top quark
production and RPV 3-body decay depend on the total width of the heavy
intermediate sfermion which could,therefore, be measured indirectly.

overdetermined $4\times 4$-matrix linear system with a spectral parameter. The
remaining part of the field equations are expressed as the conditions of
existence for this linear system of two $4\times 4$-matrix integrals of special
structures. This provides a convenient base for a generalization to these
equations of various solution generating methods developed earlier in General
Relativity.

math.DG/0010036 and math.DG/0012060 on special Lagrangian 3-folds in C^3. The
two methods described involve the use of an affine evolution equation with
affine evolution data and the area of ruled submanifolds.
  We first give a derivation of an evolution equation for associative 3-folds
from which we derive an affine evolution equation using affine evolution data.
We then use this on an example of such data to construct a 14-dimensional
family of associative 3-folds. One of the main result of the paper is then an
explicit solution of the system of differential equations generated in a
particular case to give a 12-dimensional family of associative 3-folds. We also
find that there is a straightforward condition that ensures that the
associative 3-folds constructed are closed and diffeomorphic to S^1xR^2, rather
than R^3.
  In the final section we define ruled associative 3-folds and derive an
evolution equation for them. This then allows us to characterise a family of
ruled associative 3-folds using two real analytic maps that must satisfy two
partial differential equations. We finish by giving a means of constructing

paper math.DG/0012060 by Joyce on ruled special Lagrangian 3-folds in C^3 and
the work of the author in math.DG/0401123 on ruled associative 3-folds in R^7.
We say that a 2-ruled 4-fold M is r-framed if we are given an oriented basis
for each fibre in a smooth manner, and in such circumstances we may write M in
terms of orthogonal smooth maps phi_1,phi_2:Sigma-->S^(n-1) and a smooth map
psi:Sigma-->R^n. We focus on 2-ruled Cayley 4-folds since coassociative and
special Lagrangian 4-folds can be considered as special cases.
  The main result is on non-planar, r-framed, 2-ruled Cayley 4-folds in R^8,
which characterises the Cayley condition in terms of a coupled system of
nonlinear, first-order, partial differential equations that phi_1 and phi_2
satisfy, and another such equation on psi which is linear in psi. We deduce
that, for a fixed non-planar, r-framed, 2-ruled Cayley cone M_0, the space of
r-framed 2-ruled Cayley 4-folds M which have asymptotic cone M_0 has the
structure of a vector space.
  We give a means of constructing 2-ruled Cayley 4-folds M starting from a
2-ruled Cayley cone M_0, satisfying a certain condition, using holomorphic
vector fields such that M_0 is the asymptotic cone of M. We use this to
construct explicit examples of U(1)-invariant 2-ruled Cayley 4-folds asymptotic
to a U(1)^3-invariant 2-ruled Cayley cone. Examples are also given based on
ruled calibrated 3-folds in C^3 and R^7 and complex cones in C^4.

A 69, 042104 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.69.042104",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the effect of imperfections in realistic detectors upon the
problem of quantum state and parameter estimation by continuous monitoring of
an open quantum system. Specifically, we have reexamined the system of a
two-level atom with an unknown Rabi frequency introduced by Gambetta and
Wiseman [Phys. Rev. A 64, 042105 (2001)]. We consider only direct
photodetection and use the realistic quantum trajectory theory reported by
Warszawski, Wiseman, and Mabuchi [Phys. Rev. A 65, 023802 (2002)]. The most
significant effect comes from a finite bandwidth, corresponding to an
uncertainty in the response time of the photodiode. Unless the bandwidth is
significantly greater than the Rabi frequency, the observer's ability to obtain
information about the unknown Rabi frequency, and about the state of the atom,
is severely compromised. This result has implications for quantum control in
the presence of unknown parameters for realistic detectors, and even for ideal
detectors, as it implies that most of the information in the measurement record
is contained in the precise timing of the detections.

on a 1+1 null lattice. We use our simulations to compare and contrast two
possible interpretations of the models, one in which the field values are real
and the other in which the state vector is real. We suggest that a procedure of
coarse graining and renormalising the fundamental field can overcome its
noisiness and argue that this coarse grained renormalised field will show
interesting structure if the state vector does on the coarse grained scale.
