fundamental problems. First, the model continues to depend wholly on two pieces
of undiscovered physics, namely dark energy and cold dark matter. Then, the
implied dark energy density is so small that it is unstable to quantum
correction and its size is fine-tuned to the almost impossible level of one
part in ~10^102; it is also difficult to explain the coincidence between the
dark energy, dark matter and baryon densities at the present day. Moreover, any
model with a positive cosmological constant also creates fundamental
difficulties for superstring theories of quantum gravity. We also review the
significant number of astrophysical observations which are now in contradiction
with the LCDM model. On the grounds that the SNIa Hubble diagram is prone to
evolutionary corrections and also that the CMB power spectrum may be
contaminated by the effects of foreground ionised gas, we argue that the
existence of such systematics could still allow more satisfactory, alternative,
models to appear. We suggest that if H_0<50kms^-1Mpc^-1 then a simpler,
inflationary model with Omega_baryon=1 might still be allowed with no need for
dark energy or cold dark matter.

the supermassive black hole source Sgr A* is strongly variable in the IR. The
timescale for the variability, $\sim 30$ min, is comparable to that of the
X-ray flares observed by {\em Chandra} and {\em XMM}, suggesting a common
physical origin. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the IR emission in
the context of models recently proposed to interpret the X-ray flares. We show
that the IR emission in Sgr A* can be well explained by nonthermal synchrotron
emission if a small fraction of the electrons in the innermost region of the
accretion flow around the black hole are accelerated {into a broken power-law
distribution}, perhaps due to transient events such as magnetic reconnection.
The model predicts differences in the variability amplitudes of flares in the
IR and X-rays, in general agreement with observations. It also predicts that
the IR emission should be linearly polarized, as has indeed been observed
during one epoch. IR and X-ray flares analogous to those observed in Sgr A* may
be detectable from other accreting SMBHs, provided $L \lsim 10^{-8} L_{EDD}$;
at higher luminosities the flaring emission is dominated by thermal
synchrotron-self Compton emission, which is likely to be less variable.

different underlying star formation histories and additional bursts of star
formation. Our results are robust in a relative sense under the assumption that
our galaxies shared a similar underlying star formation history and that no
bursts involving more than ~10% of the galaxy mass have occurred in the past
1-2 Gyr. We find strong correlations in age and metallicity with Hubble-type,
rotational velocity, total magnitude, and central surface brightness in the
sense that earlier-type, faster rotating, more luminous, and higher surface
brightness galaxies are older and more metal-rich, suggesting an early and more
rapid star formation history for these galaxies. The increasing trends with
rotational velocity and total magnitude level off for V_rot > 120 km/s and M_K
< -23 mag respectively. This effect is stronger for metallicity (than age)
which could reflect a threshold potential above which all metals are retained
and thus metallicity saturates at the yield. Trends in gradients with galaxy
parameters are compared with model predictions: these trends do not agree with
predictions of semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation, possibly
due to the effect of bar-induced radial flows. The observed trends are in
agreement with chemo-spectrophotometric models of spiral galaxy evolution based
on CDM-motivated scaling laws but none of the hierarchical merging
characteristics, implying a strong dependence of the star formation history of
spiral galaxies on the galaxy potential and halo spin parameter.

observations at approximately 1, 2, and 6 core-radii were obtained with the
WFPC2 camera on the HST. The multi-epoch observations allowed us to clean the
data on the basis of proper motion. In all the fields the cluster main sequence
can be traced to at least V = 27.0 but there remains a trail of stars to the
limit of the data near V = 30 in the deepest outer field. There is no evidence
that we have reached the end of the hydrogen burning main sequence in any of
our fields, however, there is some indication that very few stars remain to be
detected in the deepest data.
  The scatter about the cluster main sequence yields a surprisingly small and
variable binary fraction; f_b = 2% in the inner parts of the cluster falling to
the 1% range outside. For the currently visible main sequence stars, the
cluster mass function is very flat (alpha =0.1) in the outer field and flattens
further in the inner fields suggesting well developed mass segregation. The
observed variation in the mass function is broadly consistent with isotropic,
multi-mass Michie-King models. Because we have a large sample of white dwarfs
in the outer field we are able to show that the cluster IMF above 0.8Msun was
considerably steeper than the present day mass function for low mass stars.

analysis on the shapelet coefficients to reduce the dimensionality of the
spectral morphological parameter space. We give a description of each of the
first ten principal component's contribution to a galaxy's spectral morphology.
We find that galaxies of different broad Hubble type separate cleanly in the
principal component space. We apply a mixture of Gaussians model to the
2-dimensional space spanned by the first two principal components and use the
results as a basis for classification. Using the mixture model, we separate
galaxies into three classes and give a description of each class's physical and
morphological properties. We find that the two dominant mixture model classes
correspond to early and late type galaxies, respectively. The third class has,
on average, a blue, extended core surrounded by a faint red halo, and typically
exhibits some asymmetry. We compare our method to a simple cut on $u-r$ color
and find the shapelet method to be superior in separating galaxies.
Furthermore, we find evidence that the $u-r=2.22$ decision boundary may not be
optimal for separation between early and late type galaxies, and suggest that
the optimal cut may be $u-r \sim 2.4$.

investigate the host galaxies of typical QSOs at z~2. Our aim is to study the
host galaxies of typical, L*_qso QSOs at the epoch of peak QSO and star
formation activity. The large database of faint QSOs provided by the 2dF QSO
Redshift Survey allows us to select a sample of QSOs at z=1.75-2.5 which have
nearby (<12 arcsecond separation) bright stars suitable for use as AO guide
stars. We have observed a sample of 9 QSOs. The images of these sources have AO
corrected full-width at half-maximum of between 0.11 and 0.25 arcseconds. We
use multiple observations of point spread function (PSF) calibration star pairs
in order to quantify any uncertainty in the PSF. We then factored these
uncertainties into our modelling of the QSO plus host galaxy. In only one case
did we convincingly detect a host (2QZ J133311.4+001949, at z=1.93). This host
galaxy has K=18.5+-0.2 mag with a half-light radius, r_e=0.55+-0.1'',
equivalent to ~3L*_gal assuming a simple passively evolving model. From
detailed simulations of our host galaxy modelling process, we find that for
four of our targets we should be sensitive to host galaxies that are equivalent
to ~2L*_gal (passively evolved). Our non-detections therefore place tight
constraints on the properties of L*_qso QSO host galaxies, which can be no
brighter (after allowing for passive evolution) than the host galaxies of
L*_qso AGN at low redshift, although the QSOs themselves are a factor of ~50
brighter. This implies that either the fueling efficiency is much greater at
high redshift, or that more massive black holes are active at high redshift.

uncertainties, both observational and theoretical, on the determination of the
cluster age from the white dwarf cooling sequence. These include uncertainties
in the distance to the cluster and the extinction along the line of sight, as
well as the white dwarf mass, envelope and core compositions and the white
dwarf --main sequence mass relation. We find that fitting to the full
two-dimensional colour-magnitude diagram offers a more robust method for age
determination than the traditional method of fitting the one-dimensional white
dwarf luminosity function.
  After taking into account the various uncertainties, we find a best fit age
of 12.1 Gyr, with a 95% lower limit of 10.3 Gyr. We also perform fits using two
other sets of cooling models from the literature. The models of Chabrier et al

al (2000) do not provide as good a fit. Our results support our previous
determination of a delay between the formation of the Galactic halo and the

existence of an instability in two- and three-dimensional models of the solar

baroclinic instability for two-dimensional flat accretion disk models. As a
result linear theory predicts a transient linear instability that will amplify
perturbations only for a limited time or up to a certain finite amplification.
This can be understood as a result of the growth time of the instability being
longer than the shear time which destroys the modes which are able to grow. So
only non-linear effects can lead to a relevant amplification. Nevertheless, a
lower limit on the entropy gradient ~beta = 0.22 for the transient linear
instability is derived, which can be tested in future non-linear simulations.
This would help to explain the observed instability in numerical simulations as
an ultimate result of the transient linear instability, i.e. the Global
Baroclinic Instability.

to 0.4 dex. That is, our derived O abundances are likely overestimates: effects
from thermal inhomogeneities due to convection may require that the abundances
should be reduced by 0.3-0.4 dex or even more. Radial velocity data for
HE0107-5240 based on high-resolution spectra show that over a time span of 373

the measurements of 0.5 km/s. However, it can not yet be ruled out that
HE0107-5240 is a very long period and/or low amplitude binary. These results
provide new constraints on scenarios for the origin of the abundance pattern of

CNO have been produced in a medium-mass AGB star which later evolved to a white
dwarf. The oxygen abundance of HE0107-5240 is significantly smaller than the
prediction of Umeda & Nomoto (2003) from calculated yields of a ~25 solar mass
Population III star exploding as a supernova of low explosion energy (E_exp = 3

involving two Population III supernovae, predicts an oxygen abundance of [O/Fe]

iota Ori is an eccentric (e=0.8) binary moving with a velocity of about 10 km/s

properties of the system suggest that a strong dynamical encounter occurred in
the Trapezium cluster about 2.5 Myr ago. Curiously enough, the two binary

that their ages must be quite different. This observation leads to the
hypothesis that an exchange interaction occurred in which an older star was
swapped into the original iota Orionis binary. We test this hypothesis by a
combination of numerical and theoretical techniques, using N-body simulations
to constrain the dynamical encounter, binary evolution calculations to
constrain the high orbital eccentricity of iota Orionis and stellar evolution
calculations to constrain the age discrepancy of the two binary components. We
find that an encounter between two low eccentricity (0.4<e<0.6) binaries with
comparable binding energy, leading to an exchange and the ionization of the
wider binary, provides a reasonable solution to this problem.

very slightly with mass or metallicity. It can thus be used as a standard
candle. Here, we review the main difficulties in measuring this location in any
real dataset and develop an empirical approach to optimise it for tip of the
red giant branch (TRGB) analysis. We go on to present a new algorithm for the
identification of the TRGB in nearby metal poor stellar systems. Our method
uses a least-squares fit of a data-adaptive slope to the luminosity function in
1 magnitude windows. This finds the region of the luminosity function that
shows the most significant decline in star counts as we go to brighter
magnitudes; the base of this decline is attributed as the location of the tip.
This technique then allows for the determination of realistic uncertainties
which reflect the quality of the luminosity function used, but which are
typically ~0.02 mags rms + ~ 0.03 mags systematic, a significant improvement
upon previous methods that have used the tip as a standard candle. Finally, we

populations. This is because it is sensitive to metallicity via the opacity
effect but relatively insensitive to the effective main sequence turn-off
temperature of the population (and thus to age) when Teff ~ 7000-12000K, that
is, when the Balmer Jump is strong. This flat U-B vs Teff relation is a result
of the fact that the blueing effect of the optical continuum with increasing
temperature is temporarily stopped by the Balmer Jump which becomes greater
with temperature in this range. In this study we use U-B and B-V as metallicity
and age indicators, respectively. We first show that the use of the U-B vs B-V
two-colour diagram roughly yields the metallicities and ages of the Milky Way
globular clusters independently determined, and then apply the technique to the
clusters in NGC 5128. There is a large range in U-B, which corresponds to
[Fe/H] of -2.0 through over +0.3. The large uncertainties from the data and the
models currently prevent us from pinning down their ages and metallicities.
Although a constant age for all these clusters cannot be ruled out, there is a
hint of the metal-rich clusters being younger. Significance of these results

implement it in the parallel TreePM/SPH-code GADGET-2. We consider only
isotropic conduction and assume that magnetic suppression can be described in
terms of an effective conductivity, taken as a fixed fraction of the
temperature-dependent Spitzer rate. We also account for saturation effects in
low-density gas. Our formulation manifestly conserves thermal energy even for
individual and adaptive timesteps, and is stable in the presence of small-scale
temperature noise. This allows us to evolve the thermal diffusion equation with
an explicit time integration scheme along with the ordinary hydrodynamics. We
use a series of simple test problems to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy
of our method. We then apply our code to spherically symmetric realizations of
clusters, constructed under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and a
local balance between conduction and radiative cooling. While we confirm that
conduction can efficiently suppress cooling flows for an extended period of
time in these isolated systems, we do not find a similarly strong effect in a
first set of clusters formed in self-consistent cosmological simulations.
However, their temperature profiles are significantly altered by conduction, as
is the X-ray luminosity.

a primary in a white dwarf instability strip, making it the first multi-mode,
nonradially-pulsating star known to be accreting. The primaries of CVs,
embedded in hot, bright accretion discs, are difficult to study directly.
Applying the techniques of asteroseismology to GW Librae could therefore give
us an unprecedented look at a white dwarf that has undergone ~10^9 years of
accretion. However, an accreting white dwarf may have characteristics
sufficiently different from those of single pulsating white dwarfs to render
the standard models of white dwarf pulsations invalid for its study. This paper
presents amplitude spectra of GW Lib from a series of observing campaigns
conducted during 1997, 1998 and 2001. We find that the dominant pulsation modes
cluster at periods near 650, 370 and 230 s, which also appear in linear
combinations with each other. GW Lib's pulsation spectrum is highly unstable on
time-scales of months, and exhibits clusters of signals very closely spaced in
frequency, with separations on the order of a few microHz.

an inner high density region. In the inner part, the rotational velocity
increases from the center to a transition radius where separates the inner and

believe that this estimate is uncertain by a factor of 2, owing to the

flattening, and thus reducing the apparent brightness temperature of the radio
nucleus, has thus far not been explicitly discussed. Here we point out that
such an effect may in fact be quite significant for the parsec-scale,
superluminal emission regions associated with the inner radio jets. This is
because the observed frequency of the spectral turnover arising from the LEC
increases linearly with the bulk Doppler factor (\delta) of the jet flow,
whereas the frequency of synchrotron self-absorption (the well known cause of
spectral flattening and turnover at low frequencies) shows a mild decrease as
\delta rises. For an observationally relevant range of source parameters, we
investigate here the role of the LEC. We argue that some statistical trends
revealed by the recent VLBI surveys can in fact be understood in terms of
effects arising from LEC, including the faster superluminal motion found in the
VLBI surveys at higher frequencies, and the apparent inability of most radio
cores to even attain the brightness temperatures consistent with the
equipartition condition. We also point out some possible implications of the
LEC for X-ray observations of the kiloparsec scale relativistic jets of

  November, 2003",,"10.1063/1.1781035",,"astro-ph",,"  Observations with NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have resulted in
the discovery of fast (200 - 600 Hz), coherent X-ray intensity oscillations
(hereafter, ""burst oscillations"") during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 12 low
mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). It is now beyond doubt that these oscillations
result from spin modulation of the thermonuclear burst flux from the neutron
star surface. Among the new timing phenomena revealed by RXTE the burst
oscillations are perhaps the best understood, in the sense that many of their
properties can be explained in the framework of this relatively simple model.
Because of this, detailed modelling of burst oscillations can be an extremely
powerful probe of neutron star structure, and thus the equation of state (EOS)
of supra-nuclear density matter. The new discoveries have spurred much new
theoretical work on thermonuclear burning and propagation on neutron stars, so
that in the near future it is not unreasonable to think that detailed physical
models of the time dependent flux from burning neutron stars will be available
for comparison with the observed pulse profiles from a future, large collecting
area X-ray timing observatory. In addition, recent high resolution burst
spectroscopy with XMM/Newton suggests the presence of redshifted absorption
lines from the neutron star surface during bursts. This leads to the
possibility of using large area, high spectral resolution measurements of X-ray
bursts as a precise probe of neutron star structure. In this work I will
explore the precision with which constraints on neutron star structure, and
hence the dense matter EOS, can be made with the implementation of such
programs.

classical molecular dynamics (MD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to a
simulation consisting only of molecular dynamics. The hybrid code is composed
of three regions: a classical MD region, a continuum domain where the dynamical
equations are solved by standard CFD methods, and an overlap domain where
transport information from the other two domains is exchanged. The exchange of
information in the overlap region ensures that momentum, energy and mass are
conserved. The validity of the hybrid code is demonstrated by studying a single
polymer tethered to a hard wall immersed in explicit solvent and undergoing
shear flow. In classical molecular dynamics simulation a great deal of
computational time is devoted to simulating solvent molecules, although the
solvent itself is of no direct interest. By contrast, the hybrid code simulates
the polymer and surrounding solvent explicitly, whereas the solvent farther
away from the polymer is modeled using a continuum description. In the hybrid
simulations the MD domain is an open system whose number of particles is
controlled to filter the perturbative density waves produced by the polymer
motion.We compare conformational properties of the polymer in both simulations
for various shear rates. In all cases polymer properties compare extremely well
between the two simulation scenarios, thereby demonstrating that this hybrid
method is a useful way to model a system with polymers and under nonzero flow
conditions. There is also good agreement between the MD and hybrid schemes and
experimental data on tethered DNA in flow. The computational cost of the hybrid
protocol can be reduced to less than 6% of the cost of updating the MD forces,
confirming the practical value of the method.

is supported by detailed numerical investigations of filling within a more
microscopic Landau-like density functional theory. For sufficiently
short-ranged forces mean-field predictions for the filling critical exponents
and covariance are destroyed by pseudo-one-dimensional interfacial
fluctuations. In this filling fluctuation regime we argue that the critical
exponents describing the divergence of lengthscales are related to values of
the interfacial wandering exponent $\zeta(d)$ defined for planar interfaces in
(bulk) two-dimensional ($d=2$) and three-dimensional ($d=3$) systems,
recovering the known results for pure (thermal disorder) systems and predicting
universal critical exponents for the case of random-bond disorder. Finally we
revisit the transfer matrix theory of three-dimensional filling based on an

between relaxation time and configurational entropy, are displayed by orbits
with vanishing Lyapunov exponent. The known properties in control-parameter

distributions initially become narrower and then widen as the system
equilibrates. For deep quenches, fluctuations in the glassy system differ
significantly from those observed in equilibrium. Simulation results are
partially captured by theoretical predictions only when the final temperature
is higher than the mode coupling temperature.

in the renormalon model that the conformal expansion converges but it does not

on the internal space, and the patterns of intersections govern the chiral
fermion spectra. We discuss how the open string spectra in intersecting brane
models are constructed, how the Standard Model can be embedded, and also how
supersymmetry can be realized in this class of string vacua. After the general
considerations we specialize the discussion to the case of orbifold backgrounds
with intersecting D6-branes and to the quintic Calabi-Yau manifold. Then, we
discuss parts of the effective action of intersecting brane world models.
Specifically we compute from the Born-Infeld action of the wrapped D-branes the
tree-level, D-term scalar potential, which is important for the stability of
the considered backgrounds as well as for questions related to supersymmetry
breaking. Second, we review the recent computation concerning of gauge coupling
unification and also of one-loop gauge threshold corrections in intersecting
brane world models. Finally we also discuss some aspects of proton decay in
intersecting brane world models.

dimensional normed space. That is, embeddings that respect the order among the
distances in the original space. Our main interest is in embeddings into
Euclidean spaces. We observe that any metric on $n$ points can be embedded into
$l_2^n$, while, (in a sense to be made precise later), for almost every
$n$-point metric space, every monotone map must be into a space of dimension
$\Omega(n)$.
  It becomes natural, then, to seek explicit constructions of metric spaces
that cannot be monotonically embedded into spaces of sublinear dimension. To
this end, we employ known results on {\em sphericity} of graphs, which suggest
one example of such a metric space - that defined by a complete bipartitegraph.
We prove that an $\delta n$-regular graph of order $n$, with bounded diameter
has sphericity $\Omega(n/(\lambda_2+1))$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second
largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph, and $0 < \delta \leq
\half$ is constant. We also show that while random graphs have linear
sphericity, there are {\em quasi-random} graphs of logarithmic sphericity.
  For the above bound to be linear, $\lambda_2$ must be constant. We show that
if the second eigenvalue of an $n/2$-regular graph is bounded by a constant,
then the graph is close to being complete bipartite. Namely, its adjacency
matrix differs from that of a complete bipartite graph in only $o(n^2)$
entries. Furthermore, for any $0 < \delta < \half$, and $\lambda_2$, there are
only finitely many $\delta n$-regular graphs with second eigenvalue at most
$\lambda_2$.

from the stretching of the color field. The initial energy density is well
above the one considered necessary for the formation of the Quark Gluon Plasma,
QGP. The production of charged particles of various masses is consistent with
chemical and thermal equilibrium. Recently, a suppression of the high
transverse momentum component of hadron spectra has been observed in central
Au+Au collisions. This can be explained by the energy loss experienced by
leading partons in a medium with a high density of unscreened color charges. In
contrast, such high $p_t$ jets are not suppressed in d+Au collisions suggesting
that the high $p_t$ suppression is not due to initial state effects in the

depth of effective detection can be reached with the chemical administration of

spatial localization of the output signal offered by a confocal probe. A
solution of glycerol is taken in the capacity of innocuous osmotic agent.
Diffusion of this bio-compatible chemical agent into the skin temporarily
pushes water out of the tissues and results in the matching of the refractive
indices of skin structural elements. This temporarily decreases scattering and
increases transparency of topical skin layers, which allows for unrestricted
light to permeate deeper into the skin. The results of simulation show that
signal spatial localization offered by a confocal probe in the skin tissues
during their clearing is usable for the monitoring of deep reticular dermis and
improving the image contrast and spatial resolution. A discussion of the

procedure to transform the HF canonical molecular orbitals. Two extreme cases

error propagation together with the existence of on-line decoding. Finally, we
provide a maximum likelihood error estimation algorithm with linear classical

  2004",,,"quant-ph",,"  An efficient technique to generate ensembles of spins that are highly
polarized by external magnetic fields is the Holy Grail in Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Since spin-half nuclei have steady-state
polarization biases that increase inversely with temperature, spins exhibiting
high polarization biases are considered cool, even when their environment is
warm. Existing spin-cooling techniques are highly limited in their efficiency
and usefulness. Algorithmic cooling is a promising new spin-cooling approach
that employs data compression methods in open systems. It reduces the entropy
of spins on long molecules to a point far beyond Shannon's bound on reversible
entropy manipulations (an information-theoretic version of the 2nd Law of
Thermodynamics), thus increasing their polarization. Here we present an
efficient and experimentally feasible algorithmic cooling technique that cools
spins to very low temperatures even on short molecules. This practicable
algorithmic cooling could lead to breakthroughs in high-sensitivity NMR
spectroscopy in the near future, and to the development of scalable NMR quantum
computers in the far future. Moreover, while the cooling algorithm itself is
classical, it uses quantum gates in its implementation, thus representing the
first short-term application of quantum computing devices.

Casimir entropy in the framework of the Lifshitz formula combined with the
Drude dielectric function. An earlier result that the Casimir entropy at zero
temperature is not equal to zero and depends on the parameters of the system is
confirmed, i.e. the third law of thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem) is
violated. We illustrate the resolution of this thermodynamical puzzle in the
context of the surface impedance approach by several calculations of the
thermal Casimir force and entropy for both real metals and dielectrics.
Different representations for the impedances, which are equivalent for real
photons, are discussed. Finally, we argue in favor of the Leontovich boundary
condition which leads to results for the thermal Casimir force that are
consistent with thermodynamics.

methods, either on a classical or on a quantum basis. The system is represented
by a chain of trapped ions. The ion to be searched is a member of that chain,
consists, however, of an isotopic species different to the others. It is shown
that the classical imaging may lead as fast to the final result as the quantum
imaging. However, for the discussed case the quantum method gives more
flexibility and higher precision when the number of ions considered in the
chain is increasing. In addition, interferences are observable even when the
distances between the ions is smaller than half a wavelength of the incident
light.
