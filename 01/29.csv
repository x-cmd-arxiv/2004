is compatible with an angle distribution between 2 and 15 grades. Our best
constrained GRB formation rate histories increase from z=0 to z=2 by a factor
of ~30 and then continue increasing slightly. We connect these histories to
that of the cosmic star formation history, and compare with observational
inferences up to z~6. GRBs could be tracing the cosmic rates of both the normal

the Milky Way of ~5 10^-5 yr^-1, and compare it with the birthrate of massive
close WR+BH binaries with orbital periods of hours. The agreement is rather
good suggesting that these systems could be the progenitors of the long GRBs.

galaxies, we argue against the presence of substantial intermediate-age stellar
populations in the all of the galaxies surveyed with the exception of And VII.
We discuss these results in the context of the origin of the Andromeda dSphs

formation long before the main merger events in M31. The M31 dSphs therefore
show less diversity in star formation histories than the Galactic dSph
companions, or the M31 dE companions, as illustrated by NGC147 which was
surveyed as a calibration object. All of our dSph targets except And V have
candidate carbon stars below the tip of the RGB, which resemble CH stars found
in globular clusters. We estimate that 0.3% of stars in the dSphs are CH stars,
presumably as a result of C pollution from a binary companion. Comparisons with
CH star frequencies in globular clusters could constrain the impact of dense
environments on the frequency of this form of binary star evolution.

distribution that can be much wider than what is expected from the average
linear polarization and the off-pulse instrumental noise. Contrary to our
limited understanding of the emission mechanism, the excess dispersion in PA
implies that pulsar PAs vary in a random fashion. An eigenvalue analysis of the
measured Stokes parameters is developed to determine the origin of the excess
PA dispersion. The analysis is applied to sensitive, well-calibrated
polarization observations of PSR B1929+10 and PSR B2020+28. The analysis
clarifies the origin of polarization fluctuations in the emission and reveals
that the excess PA dispersion is caused by the isotropic inflation of the data
point cluster formed by the measured Stokes parameters. The inflation of the
cluster is not consistent with random fluctuations in PA, as might be expected
from random changes in the orientation of the magnetic field lines in the
emission region or from stochastic Faraday rotation in either the pulsar
magnetosphere or the interstellar medium. The inflation of the cluster, and
thus the excess PA dispersion, is attributed to randomly polarized radiation in
the received pulsar signal. The analysis also indicates that orthogonal
polarization modes (OPM) occur where the radio emission is heavily modulated.
In fact, OPM may only occur where the modulation index exceeds a critical value
of about 0.3.

molecular gas masses by the use of a modified value of the CO-to-H_2 conversion
factor X. The average dust mass is reduced by 25-38 per cent, which has no
bearing on earlier conclusions concering the shapes of the dust mass luminosity
function derived from the SLUGS. The value of X found from the CO survey, when

In order to assess under which circumstances the scaling properties of the
velocity field can be retrieved from velocity centroids, we compare two point
statistics (structure functions and power-spectra) of velocity centroids with
those of the underlying velocity field and analytic predictions presented in a
previous paper (Lazarian & Esquivel 2003). We tested a criterion for recovering
velocity spectral index from velocity centroids derived in our previous work,
and propose an approximation of the early criterion using only the variances of
``unnormalized'' velocity centroids and column density maps. It was found that
both criteria are necessary, however not sufficient to determine if the
centroids recover velocity statistics. Both criteria are well fulfilled for
subsonic turbulence. We find that for supersonic turbulence with sonic Mach
numbers > 2.5 centroids fail to trace the spectral index of velocity.
Asymptotically, however, we claim that recovery of velocity statistics is
always possible provided that the density spectrum is steep and the observed
inertial range is sufficiently extended. In addition, we show that velocity
centroids are useful for anisotropy studies and determining the direction of
magnetic field, even if the turbulence is highly supersonic, but only if it is
sub-Alfvenic. This provides a tool for mapping the magnetic field direction,
and testing whether the turbulence is sub-Alfvenic or super-Alfvenic.

bright globular clusters (18<V<21 mag) were observed spectroscopically. 54 new
Fornax members were discovered, plus five of the seven already known UCDs.
Their distribution in radial velocity, colour, magnitude and space was
investigated. It is found that bright compact objects (V<20 or M_V<-11.4 mag),
including the UCDs, have a higher mean velocity than faint compact objects
(V>20 mag) at 96% confidence. The mean velocity of the bright compact objects
is consistent with that of the dwarf galaxy population in Fornax, but
inconsistent with that of NGC 1399's globular cluster system at 93.5%
confidence. The compact objects follow a colour magnitude relation with a slope
very similar to that of normal dEs, but shifted about 0.2 mag redwards. The
magnitude distribution of compact objects shows a fluent transition between
UCDs and GCs with an overpopulation of 8 +/- 4 objects for V<20 mag with
respect to the extrapolation of NGC 1399's GC luminosity function. The spatial
distribution of bright compact objects is in comparison to the faint ones more
extended at 88% confidence. All our findings are consistent with the threshing
scenario (Bekki et al. 2003), suggesting that a substantial fraction of compact
Fornax members brighter than V~20 mag could be created by threshing dE,Ns.
Fainter than V~20 mag, the majority of the objects seem to be genuine GCs. Our
results are also consistent with merged stellar super-clusters (Fellhauer &

Oxygen-to-hydrogen (O/H) abundance ratios are estimated using the ""strong-line""
method, which relates the strength of bright emission lines (parameters R23 and
O32) to O/H. We confirm the existence of the luminosity-metallicity relation
over a large range of abundances (~ 2 dex) and luminosities (~ 9 magnitudes).
We find a linear relation between the gas-phase oxygen abundance and both the
""raw"" and extinction-corrected absolute B-band magnitude with a rms of 0.27. A
similar relation, with nearly the same scatter, is found in the R band. This
relation is in good agreement with the one derived by Melbourne & Salzer (2002)
using the KISS data. However, our L-Z relation is much steeper than previous
determinations using samples of ""normal"" irregular and spiral galaxies. This
difference seems to be primarily due to the choice of the galaxy sample used to
investigate the L-Z relation rather than any systematic error affecting the O/H
determination. We anticipate that this luminosity-metallicity relation will be
used as the local ""reference"" for future studies of the evolution with cosmic

superconductivity (SC) and a d Charge-Density Wave (d-CDW).The partial
destruction of the Fermi surface by the d-CDW and the resulting density of
states are discussed. Furthermore, c-axis conductances for incoherent and
coherent tunneling are calculated, considering both an isotropic and an
anisotropic in-plane momentum dependence of the hopping matrix element between
the planes. The influence of self-energy effects on the conductances is also
considered using a model where the electrons interact with a dispersionless,
low-lying branch of bosons. We show that available tunneling spectra from
break-junctions are best explained by assuming that they result from incoherent
tunneling with a strongly anisotropic hopping matrix element of the form
suggested by band structure calculations. The conductance spectra are then
characterized by one single peak which evolves continuously from the
superconducting to the d-CDW state with decreasing doping. The intrinsic c-axis
tunneling spectra are, on the other hand, best explained by coherent tunneling.
Calculated spectra show at low temperatures two peaks due to SC and d-CDW. With
increasing temperature the BCS-like peak moves to zero voltage and vanishes at
T$_c$,exactly as in experiment.Our results thus can explain why break junction

support a scenario of two competing order parameters in the underdoped region

epidemics and discuss why superspreaders emerged and why SARS spread especially
in hospitals, which were key factors of the recent outbreak. We suggest that
superspreaders are biologically contagious patients, and they may amplify the
spreads by going to potentially contagious places such as hospitals. To avoid
mass transmission in hospitals, it may be a good measure to treat suspected
cases without hospitalizing them. Finally, we indicate that SARS probably
propagates in small-world networks associated with human contacts and that the
biological nature of individuals and social group properties are factors more
important than the heterogeneous rates of social contacts among individuals.
This is in marked contrast with epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases or

or in the thermodynamic limit, a pseudogap is present and its energy diverges
as Tc is approached from above; this is an unphysical manifestation of using an

the thermodynamic limit any pseudogap predicted by this formulation will remain
finite. We have applied our method to the attractive Hubbard model on a
three-dimensional simple cubic lattice, and find that for intermediate coupling
a prominent pseudogap is found in the single-particle density of states, and
this gap persists over a large temperature range. In addition, we also show
that for weak coupling a pseudogap is also present. The pseudogap energy at the

use the recipe to derive a static spherically symmetric exact solution with
constant energy density, regular centre and finite radius, having a nontrivial
parameter that can be varied to yield a mass-radius curve from which stability
can be read off. It turns out that the solution is stable down to a tenuity R/M

capable of reducing the quantum noise contribution to the detector noise floor
to values that surpass the so-called Standard-Quantum-Limit (SQL). In
particular, squeezed light is useful for the detection of gravitational waves
at high frequencies where interferometers are typically shot-noise limited,
although the SQL might not be beaten in this case. We theoretically analyze the
quantum noise of the signal-recycled laser interferometric gravitational-wave
detector GEO600 with additional input and output optics, namely
frequency-dependent squeezing of the vacuum state of light entering the dark
port and frequency-dependent homodyne detection. We focus on the frequency
range between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, where, although signal recycled, the detector
is still shot-noise limited. It is found that the GEO600 detector with present
design parameters will benefit from frequency dependent squeezed light.
Assuming a squeezing strength of -6 dB in quantum noise variance, the
interferometer will become thermal noise limited up to 4 kHz without further
reduction of bandwidth. At higher frequencies the linear noise spectral density
of GEO600 will still be dominated by shot-noise and improved by a factor of
10^{6dB/20dB}~2 according to the squeezing strength assumed. The interferometer
might reach a strain sensitivity of 6x10^{-23} above 1 kHz (tunable) with a
bandwidth of around 350 Hz. We propose a scheme to implement the desired

and the associated Euclidean Dirichlet boundary-value problem are studied for
four and higher dimensions in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. For such boundary
conditions classically there always exists a unique hot AdS solution and two or
no Schwarzschild-AdS black-hole solutions depending on whether or not the
temperature of the cavity-wall is above a minimum value, the latter being a
function of the radius of the cavity. Assuming the standard area-law of
black-hole entropy, it was known that larger and smaller holes have positive
and negative specific heats and hence are locally thermodynamically stable and
unstable respectively. In this paper we present the first derivation of this by
showing that the standard area law of black-hole entropy holds in the
semi-classical approximation of the Euclidean path integral for such boundary
conditions. We further show that for wall-temperatures above a critical value a
phase transition takes hot AdS to the larger Schwarzschild-AdS within the
cavity. The larger hole thus can be globally thermodynamically stable above
this temperature. The phase transition can occur for a cavity of arbitrary
radius above a (corresponding) critical temperature. In the infinite cavity
limit this picture reduces to that considered by Hawking and Page. The case of
five dimensions is found to be rather special since exact analytic expressions
can be obtained for the masses of the two holes as functions of cavity radius
and temperature thus solving exactly the Euclidean Dirichlet problem. This
makes it possible to compute the on-shell Euclidean action as functions of them
from which other quantities of interest can be evaluated exactly.

$\mathcal{T} \approx 1/2\pi \ell$, the thermodynamics of the localized black
hole undergo a transition with its character changing from a 6D Schwarzschild
black hole type to a 6D black string type. The specific heat of the localized
black holes is negative, and the entropy is greater than or nearly equal to
that of the 6D black strings with the same thermodynamic mass. The large
localized black holes show flattened horizon geometries, and the intrinsic
curvature of the horizon four-geometry becomes negative near the brane. Our
results indicate that the recovery mechanism of lower-dimensional Einstein

parabolic analogues of the Nekrasov partition function (introduced by Nekrasov

These functions count (roughly speaking) principal G-bundles on the projective
plane with a trivialization at infinity and with a parabolic structure at the
horizontal line. When the above parabolic subgroup is a Borel subgroup we show
that the corresponding partition function is basically equal to the Whittaker
matrix coefficient in the universal Verma module over certain affine Lie
algebra - namely, the one whose root system is dual to that of the affinization
of Lie(G). We explain how one can think about this result as the affine
analogue of the results of Givental and Kim about Gromov-Witten invariants
(more precisely, equivariant J-functions) of flag manifolds. Thus the main
result of the paper may considered as the computation of the equivariant
J-function of the affine flag manifold associated with G (in particular, we
reprove the corresponding results for the usual flag manifolds) via the
corresponding ""Langlands dual"" affine Lie algebra. As the main tool we use the

domains separated by a hypersurface having both space- and time-like parts is

correct system of the hydro+cascade equations to model the relativistic nuclear
collision process. Remarkably, the conservation laws on the boundary between
domains conserve separately both the incoming and outgoing components of
energy, momentum and baryonic charge. Thus, the relativistic kinetic theory
generates twice the number of conservation laws compared to traditional
hydrodynamics. Our analysis shows that these boundary conditions between
domains, the three flux discontinuity, can be satisfied only by a special
superposition of two cut-off distribution functions for the ``out'' domain. All
these results are applied to the case of the phase transition between quark
gluon plasma and hadronic matter. The possible consequences for an improved
hydro+cascade description of the relativistic nuclear collisions are discussed.

from a reduction of a unitary evolution of a system coupled to a reservoir. In
such a case the reduced dynamics for the system alone will always yield
completely positive maps of the density operator. We show that, for Markovian
Bloch maps, the requirement of complete positivity imposes some Bloch
inequalities on the phenomenological damping constants. For non-Markovian Bloch
maps some kind of Bloch inequalities involving eigenvalues of the damping basis
can be established as well. As an illustration of these general properties we
use the depolarizing channel with white and colored stochastic noise.

- the relative and contingent reality of spatiotemporal distinctions and the
extrinsic and finite spatiotemporal differentiation of the physical world -
which in turn makes it possible to arrive at an unqualified objective
existence. Contrary to a widespread misconception, viewing the quantum
formalism as being fundamentally a probability algorithm does not imply that
quantum mechanics is concerned with states of knowledge rather than states of
Nature. On the contrary, it makes possible a complete and strongly objective
description of the physical world that requires no reference to observers. What
objectively exists, in a sense that requires no qualification, is the
trajectories of macroscopic objects, whose fuzziness is empirically irrelevant,
the properties and values of whose possession these trajectories provide
indelible records, and the fuzzy and temporally undifferentiated states of
affairs that obtain between measurements and are described by counterfactual
probability assignments.

unjustified. In order to demonstrate that Born's rule arises noncircularly from
deterministically evolving quantum states, it is not sufficient to assume that
quantum states are somehow associated with probabilities and then prove that
these probabilities are given by Born's rule. One has to show how irreducible
probabilities can arise in the context of an ontological no-collapse
interpretation of quantum states. It is argued that the reason why all attempts
to do this have so far failed is that quantum states are fundamentally
algorithms for computing correlations between possible measurement outcomes,
rather than evolving ontological states.
