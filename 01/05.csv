- the nearest known `fossil group'. The group is dominated by an optically
luminous giant elliptical galaxy and all other known group members are at least
two magnitudes fainter. The global X-ray properties (luminosity, temperature,
extent) of NGC 6482 fall within the range of other groups, but the detailed
properties show interesting differences. We derive the gas temperature and
total mass profiles for the central 30 kpc using ACIS spatially resolved
spectroscopy. The temperature profile shows a continuous decrease outward,
dropping to 0.63 of its central value at 0.1 r_200. The derived total mass
profile is strongly centrally peaked, suggesting an early formation epoch.
These results support a picture in which fossil groups are old, giving time for
the most massive galaxies to have merged to produce a central giant elliptical
galaxy.
  Although the cooling time within 0.1 r_200 is less than a Hubble time, no
decrease in central temperature is detected. The entropy of the system lies
toward the low side of the distribution seen in poor groups, and it drops all
the way into the centre of the system, reaching very low values. No isentropic
core, such as those predicted in simple preheating models, is present. Given
the lack of any central temperature drop in the system, it seems unlikely that
radiative cooling can be invoked to explain this low central entropy. We find
that the centrally peaked temperature profile is consistent with a steady-state
cooling flow solution with an accretion rate of 2 solar mass per year, given
the large PdV work arising from the cuspy mass profile. However, solutions
involving distributed or non-steady heating cannot be ruled out.

the calculation of the transition rate the interference of first and second
orders of perturbation theory turns out to be essential. It leads to a
suppression of relaxation at long phonon wavelengths, when the confining
potential moves together with the nuclei embedded in the lattice. At higher
frequencies (or for a fixed confining potential), the zero-temperature rate is
proportional to the frequency of the emitted phonon. We address both the
transition between Zeeman sublevels of a single electron ground state as well

study the phase diagram of a 2D Josephson junction array, that is one of the

stiffness shows a reentrant behavior at lowest temperatures, driven by strong
nonlinear quantum fluctuations. Such a reentrance is removed if the dissipation

the PDE governing the wave propagation, with the resulting radial ODE an
incarnation of the confluent Heun equation. For a given angular index l the
ROBC feature integral convolution between a time-domain radiation boundary
kernel (TDRK) and each of the corresponding 2l+1 spherical-harmonic modes of
the radiating wave. The TDRK is the inverse Laplace transform of a
frequency-domain radiation kernel (FDRK) which is essentially the logarithmic
derivative of the asymptotically outgoing solution to the radial ODE. We
numerically implement the ROBC via a rapid algorithm involving approximation of
the FDRK by a rational function. Such an approximation is tailored to have
relative error \epsilon uniformly along the axis of imaginary Laplace
frequency. Theoretically, \epsilon is also a long-time bound on the relative
convolution error. Via study of one-dimensional radial evolutions, we
demonstrate that the ROBC capture the phenomena of quasinormal ringing and
decay tails. Moreover, carrying out a numerical experiment in which a wave
packet strikes the boundary at an angle, we find that the ROBC yield accurate
results in a three-dimensional setting. Our work is a partial generalization to
Schwarzschild wave propagation and Heun functions of the methods developed for
flatspace wave propagation and Bessel functions by Alpert, Greengard, and
Hagstrom.

method is applied to point vortices systems on a sphere and on the plane, but
works for other surfaces with isotropy (cylinder, ellipsoid, ...). The method
permits also to determine some relative equilibria and heteroclinic cycles
connecting these relative equilibria.

chaotic saddle is described by binary or ternary horseshoes. We are interested
in parameters of the system for which a stable island, associated with the
inner fundamental periodic orbit of the system exists and is large, but chaos
around this island is well developed. In this situation, in classical systems,
decay from the interaction region is algebraic, while in quantum systems it is
exponential due to tunneling. In both cases, the most surprising effect is a
periodic response to an incoming wave packet. The period of this self-pulsing
effect or scattering echoes coincides with the mean period, by which the
scattering trajectories rotate around the stable orbit. This period of rotation
is directly related to the development stage of the underlying horseshoe.
Therefore the predicted echoes will provide experimental access to topological
information. We numerically test these results in kicked one dimensional models
and in open billiards.

  NSS/93-8 that was presented at the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium, in San
  Francisco, on Oct. 30-Nov. 6, 1993",,,,"physics.acc-ph",,"  A design concept and characteristics for an epithermal breeder controlled by
variable feedback and external neutron source intensity are presented. By
replacing the control rods with neutron sources, we could improve safety and
perform radioactive waste burning in high flux subcritical reactors (HFSR). To
increase neutron source intensity the HFSR is divided into two zones: a booster
and a blanket operating with solid and liquid fuels. Use of a liquid actinide
fuel permits transport of the delayed-neutron emitters from the blanket to the
booster where they can provide additional neutrons or all the necessary
excitation. With blanket and booster multiplication factors of k=0.95 and 0.98,
respectively, an external photoneutron source rate of at least 10.sup.15 n/s
(electron beam power 2.5MW) is needed to control the HFSR that produces 300MWt.
An inexpensive method of obtaining large neutron fluxes is target-distributed
accelerators (TDA), in which a fission electrical cell (FEC) compensates for
lost beam energy in the thin photon production targets. The FEC is essentially
a high-voltage power source that directly converts the kinetic energy of the
fission fragments into electrical potential of about 2 MV.

  Huckle (Virginia Tech)","Acid-mediated tumor invasion: How does vasculature affect the growth
  characteristics?","26 pages, 8 fig (1 figure replaced, minor changes in text)",,,,"q-bio.CB q-bio.QM",,"  We study the growth of an implanted a-vascular tumor seed in two-dimensions
based on a model where the mechanism of invasion is centered on tumor-induced
acidification of the micro-environment and consequent death of normal cells.
The spatial distribution of the acid density around the tumor is found using
mean-field analysis. By assuming that the viability of both normal and tumor
cells falls sharply below certain threshold values of the local pH, we
determine the conditions for the formation of a necrotic core at the center, as
well as its radius as a function of the tumor radius. We show that the mean
micro-vessel density (MVD) plays a pivotal role in determining the growth
characteristics of the tumor. When the MVD is sufficiently small, accumulation
of excess acid inside the tumor leads to the formation of a necrotic core,
which occupies a significant fraction of the total area in large tumors.
However, necrosis is reduced when the mean MVD inside the tumor is larger than
outside because of the more efficient removal of excess acid. At sufficiently
high MVD, necrosis is absent in the tumor, or confined to small regions mostly
devoid of micro-vessels. Quantitative estimates of MVD for these different
phases of growth are obtained, and verified using explicit cellular automaton
simulations. Recent experimental studies on the correlation between necrosis
and MVD support our main conclusions.

volume, analogous to the situation inside a cell where the cell boundary forms
a natural barrier to growth. We show that the dynamical equations for growing
and shrinking microtubules predict the existence of two steady states, with
either exponentially decaying or exponentially increasing distribution of
microtubule lengths. We identify the regimes in parameter space corresponding
to these steady states. In the latter case, the apparent catastrophe frequency
near the boundary was found to be significantly larger than that in the
interior. Both the exponential distribution of lengths and the increase in the
catastrophe frequency near the cell margin is in excellent agreement with
recent experimental observations.

equivalent to that of cryptographic one-way functions. In the quantum

would be necessary. In this paper, we affirmatively settle their conjecture and
complete a necessary and sufficient for quantum one-way permutations. The
necessary and sufficient condition can be regarded as a universal test for
quantum one-way permutations, since the condition is described as a collection
of stepwise tests similar to the next bit test for pseudorandom generators.
