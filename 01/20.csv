fraction of the swept-up circumstellar magnetic field is dynamically compressed
to approximate equipartition at the contact discontinuity separating the SN
progenitor's wind (or the ISM) and the ejecta. We propose that the thin
non-thermal X-ray filaments observed by the Chandra satellite in several young
SNRs are associated with such ``pile-up'' of the magnetic field. We use a
one-dimensional diffusion-convection transport equation to describe the
propagation of non-thermal electrons near the contact discontinuity of a young
SNR and to calculate spatially resolved emission spectra in the X-ray and TeV
bands. The results suggest that the high-energy electrons are possibly
accelerated at the forward shock, and emitting efficiently only when they
diffuse into regions of high magnetic field near the contact discontinuity.
Much more likely, though, is that they are locally accelerated at the contact
discontinuity, in which case the acceleration cannot be related to Fermi-type
processes and should occur due to other plasma mechanisms. As a consequence,
the forward shock in young SNRs is inconspicuous and often unobservable,
similar to that in the Crab nebular.

passed through the core of the cluster, their interstellar gas should have been
lost through ram pressure stripping by the hot X-ray emitting gas of the
cluster. We analyze the positions of these HI-deficient and other spiral
galaxies in velocity-distance plots, in which we include our compilation of
velocity-distance data on 61 elliptical galaxies, and compare with simulated
velocity-distance diagrams obtained from cosmological N-body simulations. We
find that ~20% relative Tully-Fisher distance errors are consistent with the
great majority of the spirals, except for a small number of objects, whose
positions in the velocity-distance diagram suggest grossly incorrect distances,
which implies that the Tully-Fisher error distribution function has
non-gaussian wings. Moreover, we find that the distance errors may lead to an
incorrect fitting of the Tolman-Bondi solution that can generate significant
errors in the distance and especially the mass estimates of the cluster. We
suggest 4 possibilities for the outlying HI-deficient spirals (in decreasing
frequency): 1) they have large relative distance errors and are in fact close
enough (at distances between 12.7 and 20.9 Mpc from us) to the cluster to have
passed through its core and seen their gas removed by ram pressure stripping;
2) their gas is converted to stars by tidal interactions with other galaxies;
3) their gas is heated during recent mergers with smaller galaxies; and 4) they
are in reality not HI-deficient (e.g. S0/a's misclassified as Sa's).

Instantaneous Doppler maps show how the stream impact moves in velocity space

region emission is distorted, and the spiral density wave emission is
uppressed. A significant radial velocity modulation of the whole line profile

could account for the high inclinations of the Kuiper belt, as originally
proposed by Ida, Larwood and Burkert, however we consider encounters with

entering the solar system on a nearly parabolic, low inclination, retrograde
orbit with perihelion of 50 AU can scatter ~30% of the Kuiper belt into
moderate inclination (i>10 degrees) and eccentricity orbits, while leaving the
rest of the belt at low eccentricities and inclinations. This scenario provides
a possible explanation for the dichotomy of the Kuiper belt, accounting for the
scattered and classical populations, including objects with high eccentricities
and inclinations. High eccentricity objects that were not placed into resonance
with Neptune are more likely to be removed from the system by subsequent long
timescale evolution. Consequently this scenario suggests that some Plutinos
could have originally been objects in circular orbits which were scattered into
resonant high eccentricity and high inclination orbits by the stellar
encounter. Objects could have been placed into stable resonant regions with
Neptune by the encounter. However long lived regions of dynamical stability
should differ from those selected by resonance capture. This scenario predicts
the presence of objects in resonances with Neptune that are unlikely to have
been captured via Neptune's migration.

results from the five field E/S0 lens galaxies at z=0.5-1.0 analyzed as part of
the LSD Survey. We find: (i) Constant M/L models are ruled out at >99% CL for
all five E/S0s. The projected dark-matter mass fractions inside the Einstein
(effective) radius is f_DM=0.37-0.72 (0.15-0.65) for isotropic models. (ii) The
average power-law slope of the total mass distribution is <\gamma'>=1.75+-0.10

central stellar velocity dispersion and that from the best-fit SIE lens model
is <f_SIE>=<\sigma/\sigma_SIE>=0.87+-0.04 with 0.08 rms. Considering that
\gamma'>2 and f_SIE>1 have been reported for other systems, we conclude that
there is a significant intrinsic scatter in the density slopes of E/S0s (rms
\~15%). Hence, the isothermal approximation is not sufficiently accurate for
applications that depend critically on the slope of the mass density profile
(i.e. measuring H_0). (iii) The inner power-law slope of the dark-matter halo
is constrained to be <\gamma>=1.3(+0.2/-0.4) (68% CL) for the isotropic model
or an upper limit of \gamma<0.6, if the galaxies are radially anisotropic
(r_i=R_e). This is consistent with numerical simulations only for an isotropic
velocity ellipsoid and if baryonic collapse and star-formation do not steepen
dark-matter density profiles. (iv) The average stellar M/L evolves as
d\log(M_*/L_B)/dz =-0.72+-0.10, obtained via the FP. Based on lensing and
dynamics we find d\log(M_*/L_B)/dz=-0.75+-0.17, indicating that the M/L ratio

that M31 is visible. The two fields of view straddle the central bulge,
northwards and southwards. We have calculated the locations, periods and
amplitudes of 35414 variable stars in M31 as a by-product of our microlensing
search. The variables are classified according to their period and amplitude of
variation. They are classified into population I and II Cepheids, Miras and
semi-regular long-period variables. The population I Cepheids are associated
with the spiral arms, while the central concentration of the Miras and
long-period variables varies noticeably, the stars with brighter (and shorter)
variations being much more centrally concentrated. A crucial role in the
microlensing experiment is played by the asymmetry signal. It was initially
assumed that the variable stars would not be a serious problem as their
distributions would be symmetric. We demonstrate that this assumption is not
correct. We find that differential extinction associated with the dust lanes
causes the variable star distributions to be asymmetric. The size and direction
of the asymmetry of the variable stars is measured as a function of period and
amplitude of variation. The implications of this discovery for the successful
completion of the microlensing experiments towards M31 are discussed.

M > 140 Msun). We review the two major lines of evidence for the existence of
VMS: (1) that the relative metal abundances of extremely metal-poor Galactic
halo stars show evidence of VMS enrichment, and (2) that the high
electron-scattering optical depth (tau_e) to the CMB found by WMAP requires VMS
for reionization in a concordance LambdaCDM cosmology. The supernova yield
patterns of VMS are incompatible with the Fe-peak and r-process abundances in
halo stars. Models including Type II supernovae and/or ``hypernovae'' from
metal-free progenitors with 8 - 40 Msun can better explain the observed trends.
With a simple metal-transport model, we estimate that halo enrichment curtails
metal-free star formation after ~10^8 yr at z ~ 20. Because the ionizing photon
efficiency of metal-free stars peaks at ~120 Msun and declines at higher mass,
an IMF with a lower bound at M ~ 10 - 20 Msun and no VMS can maximize the
ionizing photon budget and still be consistent with the nucleosynthetic
evidence. An IMF devoid of low-mass stars is justified independently by models
of the formation of primordial stars. Using a semi-analytic model for H I and
He II reionization, we find that such an IMF can reproduce tau_e = 0.10 - 0.14,
consistent with the range from WMAP. We conclude, on the basis of these
results, that VMS are not necessary to meet the existing constraints commonly
taken to motivate them.

rate of n_r^-0.5. The cause of this read noise behavior is uncertain, but may
be due to heating of the array as a result of the multiple read outs. Such
behavior may be generic to arrays that employ correlated or multiple correlated
double sampling readouts.

shifts toward higher altitudes with the increase of energy; the separation
between the LT emission centroids at two different photon energies is
anti-correlated with the FP flux. Non-uniformity of the reconnecting magnetic

that a Schwarzschild black hole may act as a retro-lens (Holz & Wheeler

deflects light ray paths to large bending angles so that the light may reach
the observer. Here, by considering the strong field limit in the deflection
angle and confining our analysis to the black hole equatorial plane, we extend
the Holz-Wheeler results to slowly spinning Kerr black holes. By considering

find that the inclusion of rotation does not substantially change the

group finding algorithm, which can efficiently identify halos located even at
crowded regions. This method combines two physical criteria such as the tidal
radius of a halo and the total energy of each particle to find member
particles. Two hierarchical meshes are used to increase the speed and the power
of halo identification in the parallel computing environments. First, a coarse
mesh with cell size equal to the mean particle separation $l_{\rm mean}$ is
used to obtain the density field over the whole simulation box. Mesh cells
having density contrast higher than a local cutoff threshold $\delta_{\rm LOC}$
are extracted and linked together for those adjacent to each other. This
produces local-cell groups. Second, a finer mesh is used to obtain density
field within each local-cell group and to identify halos. If a density shell
contains only one density peak, its particles are assigned to the density peak.
But in the case of a density shell surrounding at least two density peaks, we
use both the tidal radii of halo candidates enclosed by the shell and the total
energy criterion to find physically bound particles with respect to each halo.
Similar to DENMAX and HOP, the \hfind method can efficiently identify small
halos embedded in a large halo, while the FoF and the SO do not resolve such
small halos. We apply our new halo finding method to a 1-Giga particle
simulation of the $\Lambda$CDM model and compare the resulting mass function
with those of previous studies. The abundance of physically self-bound halos is
larger at the low mass scale and smaller at the high mass scale than proposed

constraints on most parameters. The most important result is that the outer
boundary of the synchrotron emission region must lie between 500 and 2200
stellar radii. This means that shocks must persist up to that distance. We also
find that relatively weak shocks (with a compression ratio < 3) are needed to
produce the observed radio spectrum. These results are compatible with current
hydrodynamical predictions. Most of our models also show a relativistic
electron fraction that increases outwards. This points to an increasing
efficiency of the acceleration mechanism, perhaps due to multiple acceleration,

  in a polymer glass at low temperatures","28 pages including 6 figures (in all 302 kb); submitted to Phys. Rev.
  B (5 December 2003)",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  Irreversible broadening of spectral holes in chlorin-doped polystyrene glass
was studied for the first time in the temperature cycling experiments under
high pressure (by raising the temperature from 5 K to various magnitudes up to
18 K and turning back to 5 K at several fixed pressures between 0 and 5 kbar).
At all pressures the increment in the hole width observed after completing a
temperature cycle exhibits a slightly superlinear (proportional to T to the
power 3/2) dependence on the cycling temperature. The magnitude of this
increment is essentially reduced under high pressure (e.g., at 4.9 kbar it
makes up less than 2/3 of its initial value obtained at ambient pressure). The
residual broadening of holes is interpreted as a result of irreversible
thermally induced spectral diffusion arising from interaction of the electronic
transition in a dopant molecule with two-level systems (TLSs) which perform
thermally activated overbarrier jumps between two possible states of a TLS. The
pressure effects are treated theoretically within the scope of the soft
anharmonic potential model with asymmetric distribution of the cubic
anharmonicity parameter. It is shown that more abundant are TLSs with such
double-well potentials where the minimum, corresponding to a larger glass
volume, is placed at a higher energy than the minimum, corresponding to a
smaller volume. In this case, applied pressure reduces the number of almost
symmetric TLSs (having very small energy difference between the two minima),
which provide the largest contribution to the residual broadening of spectral
holes after a temperature cycle. Our earlier results on isothermal hole burning
at various fixed pressures [V. Hizhnyakov et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 11296
(2000)] also qualitatively fit into this picture.

been known for some time now that these fluctuations may have observable
consequences for the propagation of cosmic ray particles over cosmological
distances. While invoked as a possible explanation for the detection of the
puzzling cosmic rays with energies in excess of the threshold for photopion
production (the so-called super-GZK particles), we demonstrate here that lower
energy observations may provide strong constraints on the role of a fluctuating
space-time structure. We note also that the same fluctuations, if they exist,
imply that some decay reactions normally forbidden by elementary conservation
laws, become kinematically allowed, inducing the decay of particles that are
seen to be stable in our universe. Due to the strength of the prediction, we
are led to consider this finding as the most severe constraint on the classes
of models that may describe the effects of gravity on the structure of
space-time. We also propose and discuss several potential loopholes of our
approach, that may affect our conclusions. In particular, we try to identify
the situations in which despite a fluctuating energy-momentum of the particles,
the reactions mentioned above may not take place.

and inflation occur concurrently. I then discuss recent, detailed, quantum

described by singular Lagrangians and by Dirac-Bergmann theory of Hamiltonian
constraints. As a consequence a subset of the original configuration variables
are {\it gauge variables}, not determined by the equations of motion. Only at
the Hamiltonian level it is possible to separate the gauge variables from the
deterministic physical degrees of freedom, the {\it Dirac observables}, and to
formulate a well posed Cauchy problem for them both in special and general
relativity. Then the requirement of {\it causality} dictates the choice of {\it
retarded} solutions at the classical level. However both the problems of the
classical theory of the electron, leading to the choice of ${1\over 2}
(retarded + advanced)$ solutions, and the regularization of quantum field
teory, leading to the Feynman propagator, introduce {\it anticipatory} aspects.
The determination of the relativistic Darwin potential as a semi-classical
approximation to the Lienard-Wiechert solution for particles with
Grassmann-valued electric charges, regularizing the Coulomb self-energies,
shows that these anticipatory effects live beyond the semi-classical
approximation (tree level) under the form of radiative corrections, at least
for the electro-magnetic interaction.

Rigorous versions of this result are obtained in a continuous time--lattice

the role of the Lie bracket and the linking number replaces the invariant form.

behavior of light from stellar and local sources, in relation to speed-induced
aberration. A small laser is set at the center of the objective lens of a

positions are recorded during a yearly earth orbit, so stellar aberration can
be visualized as a tiny circle. But no aberration has been observed from local
sources, hence the laser spot should remain still. The simultaneous recording
of both spots allows highlighting their different behavior. Einstein related
aberration to the transverse speed between light source and observer, and since
for local sources it is null, no aberration ensues. Despite this explanation
conforms with the correct result for local sources, it cannot however be
retained since stellar aberration does not vary although relative speed differs
for each star. Consequently, the null transverse velocity cannot be considered
the cause of the null aberration from local sources. A causal approach to this
different behavior between stellar and local light is advanced, based on the
combined effects of a speed-induced deflection of emitted light rays and a
speed-induced aberration upon detection.

provide a new way to ratify the first order optical equivalency of inertial
systems and to sound its causal groundwork. The type of test provided applies
to any device using beams, but here it has been adapted for an up-dated
check-up of Michelson's experiment and to bear out the interpretation derived
from its null result. Rather than searching for a speed-induced phase-shift as
Michelson's experiment was conceived for, the present set-up would instead
detect any deviation from first-order equivalency through any speed-induced
lateral-shift between the two split beams on recombining. In effect, any
eventual slight shift would affect the beam path and hence the interferometric
performances. Taking into account the conceptual transcendence of the
deductions derived from this experiment and that it constitutes, through the
invariance of its result, one of the most relevant historical experimental
proofs considered to back the theory of special relativity, and in particular
its first postulate on the exhaustive equivalency of inertial systems, it
cannot be superfluous to carefully update its performances and the derived
deductions. So, the presence as well as the absence of speed-induced beam
deflection have been considered, and their respective implications analyzed and
related to the null result of this archetypal interferometric experiment, which
is still much adequate for a conceptual analysis. A causal approach to the

a flat potential energy surface. Increased Na coverage results in a weak

the surface in the cases of Na_3, Na_4, Na_5, and the (2x2) Na overlayer. The
binding is weak for Na_2, which has a full valence electron shell. The presence

positivity decoherence condition of Goldstein and Page. A quantum theory of
closed systems requires two elements; 1) a condition specifying which sets of
histories may be assigned probabilities that are consistent with the rules of
probability theory, and 2) a rule for those probabilities. The linear
positivity condition of Goldstein and Page is the weakest of the general
conditions proposed so far. Its general properties relating to exact
probability sum rules, time-neutrality, and conservation laws are explored. Its
inconsistency with the usual notion of independent subsystems in quantum
mechanics is reviewed. Its relation to the stronger condition of medium
decoherence necessary for classicality is discussed. The linear positivity of
histories in a number of simple model systems is investigated with the aim of
exhibiting linearly positive sets of histories that are not decoherent. The
utility of extending the notion of probability to include values outside the
range of 0 to 1 is described. Alternatives with such virtual probabilities
cannot be measured or recorded, but can be used in the intermediate steps of
calculating real probabilities. Virtual probabilities give a simple and general
way of formulating quantum theory.
