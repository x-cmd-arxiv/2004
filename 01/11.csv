  Astronomical Jourmal","Astron.J.127:2002,2004","10.1086/382723",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the [OII] emission-line as a star formation rate (SFR)
indicator using integrated spectra of 97 galaxies from the Nearby Field
Galaxies Survey (NFGS). The sample includes all Hubble types and contains SFRs
ranging from 0.01 to 100 Msun/yr. We compare the Kennicutt [OII] and H-alpha
SFR calibrations and show that there are two significant effects which produce
disagreement between SFR[OII] and SFR(H-alpha): reddening and metallicity.
Differences in the ionization state of the ISM do not contribute significantly
to the observed difference between SFR([OII]) and SFR(H-alpha) for the NFGS
galaxies with metallicities log(O/H)12>8.5. The Kennicutt [OII]-SFR relation
assumes a typical reddening for nearby galaxies; in practice, the reddening
differs significantly from sample to sample. We derive a new SFR([OII])
calibration which does not contain a reddening assumption. Our new SFR([OII])
calibration also provides an optional correction for metallicity. Our SFRs
derived from [OII] agree with those derived from H-alpha to within 0.03-0.05
dex. We apply our SFR([OII]) calibration with metallicity correction to two
samples: high-redshift 0.8<z<1.6 galaxies from the NICMOS H-alpha survey, and
0.5<z<1.1 galaxies from the Canada-France Redshift Survey. The SFR([OII]) and
SFR(H-alpha) for these samples agree to within the scatter observed for the
NFGS sample, indicating that our SFR([OII]) relation can be applied to both
local and high-z galaxies. Finally, we apply our SFR([OII]) to estimates of the
cosmic star formation history. After reddening and metallicity corrections, the
star formation rate densities derived from [OII] and H-alpha agree to within
30%.

below photon energies of 2 keV, can be fitted with a multi-temperature plasma
model and is uneclipsed. The hard component, dominant above 3 keV, can be

of growing interest in fundamental and applied soft-condensed-matter science. A
common feature of all such systems is the presence of a mesoscopic structural
length scale intermediate between atomic and macroscopic scales. This
mesoscopic structure of complex fluids is often fragile and sensitive to
external perturbations. Complex fluids are frequently viscoelastic (showing a
combination of viscous and elastic behaviour) with their dynamic response
depending on the time and length scales. Recently, non-invasive methods to
infer the rheological response of complex fluids have gained popularity through
the technique of microrheology, where the diffusion of probe spheres in a
viscoelastic fluid is monitored with the aid of light scattering or microscopy.
Here we propose an alternative to traditional microrheology that does not
require doping of probe particles in the fluid (which can sometimes drastically
alter the molecular environment). Instead, our proposed method makes use of the
phenomenon of ""avoided crossing"" between modes associated with the structural
relaxation and critical fluctuations that are spontaneously generated in the
system.

lattices do not preserve rigid geometric structures in the sense of Gromov. The
actions considered are the ""exotic"" examples obtained by Katok and Lewis and
the first author, by blowing up closed orbits in the well known actions on
homogeneous spaces. The actions on homogeneous spaces all preserve affine
connections, whereas the action along the exceptional divisor preserves a
projective structure. The fact that these structures cannot in some way be
""glued together"" to give a rigid structure on the entire space is not obvious.
  We also define the notion of an almost rigid structure. The paradigmatic
example of a rigid structure is a global framing and the paradigmatic example
of an almost rigid structure is a framing that is degenerate along some
exceptional divisor. We show that the actions discussed above do possess an
invariant almost rigid structure.
  Gromov has shown that a manifold with rigid geometric structure invariant
under a topologically transitive group action is homogeneous on an open dense
set. How generally this open dense set can be taken to be the entire manifold
is an important question with many dynamical applications. Our results indicate
one way in which the geometric structure cannot degenerate off the open dense

Extended published version","Apeiron 12 (2005) 144-177",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Gravitational anomalies such as the mine/borehole g anomaly, the
near-flatness of the spiral galaxy rotation-velocity curves, currently
interpreted as a `dark matter' effect, the absence of that effect in ordinary
elliptical galaxies, and the ongoing problems in accurately determining
Newton's gravitational constant G_N are explained by a generalisation of the
Newtonian theory of gravity to a fluid-flow formalism with one new
dimensionless constant. By analysing the borehole data this constant is shown
to be the fine structure constant alpha=1/137. The spiral galaxy `dark matter'
effect and the globular cluster `black hole' masses are then correctly
predicted. This formalism also explains the cause of the long-standing
uncertainties in G_N and leads to the introduction of a fundamental
gravitational constant G not = G_N with value G=(6.6526 +/- 0.013)x 10^-11
m^3s^{-2}kg^{-1}. The occurrence of alpha implies that space has a quantum
structure, and we have the first evidence of quantum gravity effects.

momentum. Here, a mathematically equivalent and simple non-relativistic
interpretation shows that the Compton frequency shift is equal to the de
Broglie frequency associated with the moving charged particle (e.g., an
electron). In this work, the moving electron is considered as a particle and
the electromagnetic energy associated with it is shown to be proportional to
the de Broglie frequency. This energy is released when its motion is arrested,
as for example on a diffraction screen, where it causes the observed
interfernce patterns. Thus, electrons transport electromagnetic energy from a
source to a sink.

found in applications, where there is a control parameter which determines
whether the population quickly becomes extinct, or rather persists for a long
time. We give an exact expression for the discrete case and its asymptotic
expansion for large values of the population. We have results below the
threshold, at the threshold, and above the threshold (where there is a
quasi-stationary state and the extinction time is very long.) We show that the
Fokker-Planck approximation is valid only quite near the threshold. We compare
our analytical results to numerical simulations for the SIS epidemic model,
which is in the class that we treat. This is an interesting example of the
delicate relationship between discrete and continuum treatments of the same
problem.

proteins by making the contact interactions dependent on the proximity to the
native conformation. The kinetic universality classes are found to remain the
same as in the absence of cooperativity. For a fixed native geometry, small
changes in the effective contact map may affect the folding times in a chance
way and to the extent that is comparable to the shift in the folding times due
to cooperativity. The contact order controlls folding scenarios: the average
times necessary to bring pairs of amino acids into their near native
separations depend on the sequential distances within the pairs. This
dependence is largely monotonic, regardless of the cooperativity, and the
dominant trend could be described by a single parameter like the average
contact order. However, it is the deviations from the trend which are usually
found to set the net folding times.

coupled to a faster data bus whose frequency is much larger than the energy
spacing of the qubits and thus the BO approximation is valid. Then the
adiabatic separation of qubits from the data bus can induce an effective
potential to couple the two qubits, which can be utilized to create a quantum
logic gate. We also discuss the quantum decoherence caused by the adiabatic
entanglement between the two qubits and the external field.
