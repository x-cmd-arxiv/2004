information. However, this information is encoded in non-trivial ways in a
signal that is difficult to observe. The resulting challenges in extracting
this information from CMB data sets have created a new frontier. In this talk I
will discuss the challenges of CMB data analysis. I review what cosmological
information is contained in the CMB data and the problem of extracting it. CMB
analyses can be divided into two types: ``canonical'' parameter extraction
which seeks to obtain the best possible estimates of cosmological parameters
within a pre-defined theory space and ""hypothesis testing"" which seeks to test
the assumption on which the canonical tests rest. Both of these activities are
fundamentally important. In addition to mining the CMB for cosmological
information cosmologists would like to strengthen the analysis with data from
other cosmologically interesting observations as well as physical constraints.
This gives an opportunity 1) to test the results from these separate probes for
concordance and 2) if concordance is established to sharpen the constraints on
theory space by combining the information from these separate sources.

and signal reconstruction for Gaussian random fields (MAGIC Allows Global
Inference of Covariance). It solves a long-standing problem in the field of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) data analysis but is in fact a general
technique that can be applied to noisy, contaminated and incomplete or censored
measurements of either spatial or temporal Gaussian random fields. In this talk
I will phrase the method in a way that emphasizes its general structure and
applicability but I comment on applications in the CMB context. The method
allows the exploration of the full non-Gaussian joint posterior density of the
signal and parameters in the covariance matrix (such as the power spectrum)
given the data. It generalizes the familiar Wiener filter in that it
automatically discovers signal correlations in the data as long as a noise
model is specified and priors encode what is known about potential
contaminants. The key methodological difference is that instead of attempting
to evaluate the likelihood (or posterior density) or its derivatives, this
method generates an asymptotically exact Monte Carlo sample from it. I present
example applications to power spectrum estimation and signal reconstruction
from measurements of the CMB. For these applications the method achieves
speed-ups of many orders of magnitude compared to likelihood maximization
techniques, while offering greater flexibility in modeling and a full
characterization of the uncertainty in the estimates.

capture on nucleons provide the dominant mechanisms for heating and cooling the
material between the protoneutron star and the stalled shock in a core-collapse
supernova. Observations suggest that some neutron stars are born with magnetic
fields of at least 10^15 G while theoretical considerations give an upper limit
of 10^18 G for the protoneutron star magnetic fields. We calculate the rates
for the above neutrino processes in strong magnetic fields of 10^16 G. We find
that the main effect of such magnetic fields is to change the equations of
state through the phase space of electron and positron, which differs from the
classical case due to quantization of the motion of electron and positron
perpendicular to the magnetic field. As a result, the cooling rate can be
greatly reduced by magnetic fields of 10^16 G for typical conditions below the
stalled shock and a nonuniform protoneutron star magnetic field (e.g., a dipole
field) can introduce a large angular dependence of the cooling rate. In
addition, strong magnetic fields always lead to an angle-dependent heating rate
by polarizing the spin of nucleons. The implications of our results for the
neutrino-driven supernova mechanism are discussed.

investigate whether the abundance enhancements inferred from single-dish

ice mantles by shocks in the inner envelope. A scenario in which the H2CO
abundance drops in the cold dense part of the envelope where CO is frozen out
but is undepleted in the outermost region provides good fits to the single-dish

longer baselines is best reproduced if the H2CO abundance is increased by about
an order of magnitude from ~1E-10 to ~1E-9 in the inner parts of the envelope
due to thermal evaporation when the temperature exceeds ~50K. Other scenarios,

the other at ~6.9 keV in the source rest frame. When modeled by Gaussians, the
lower energy peak is resolved by the HEG at >99% confidence, whilst the higher
energy peak is resolved at only <90% confidence. The best-fitting widths are
\~21,000km/s and ~4000km/s FWHM for the ~6.3 keV and ~6.9 keV peaks
respectively. If the peaks correspond to two distinct emission lines, then the
peak energies are redshifted with respect to the expected line energies of Fe I
Ka and Fe XXVI Lya by at least 650 km/s and 950 km/s respectively.
Alternatively, the Fe K line profile may be due to a single line from a
relativistic accretion disk. In that case the inclination angle of the disk is
required to be 24^{+9}_{-1} degrees, the outer radius constrained to several
tens of gravitational radii, and the radial line emissivity flatter than
r^{-0.7}. Another possibility is that both peaks are due to distinct lines but
each one relativistically broadened by a disk. In that case the lower energy
peak could correspond to emission from Fe in a low ionization state, and the
high-energy peak to Fe XXVI Lya emission. Then, the inclination angle is even
less, restricted to a few degrees. However, the radial emissivity law is
allowed to be steeper (~r^{-2.5}) and the outer radius does not have to be
fine-tuned. Yet another scenario is that the lower energy peak originates in a
disk but the higher energy peak originates in more distant matter.

about 0.002 or better, which is a challenging but feasible requirement for a
low-resolution spectrograph. However, we find that accurate redshifts for z<0.1

the results against even relatively large redshift errors at high z. For the
future cluster number-count surveys such as the South Pole Telescope, Planck or

redshift bin (which is determined by the filter set), depending on the sky
coverage and details of the definition of the minimal mass of the survey.

black hole surrounded by a compact disk or torus. This forms an energetic
MeV-nucleus inside a remnant He-core, powered by black hole-spin energy. The
output produces a GRB-supernova, while most of the energy released is in
gravitational radiation. The intrinsic gravitational-wave spectrum is
determined by multipole mass-moments in the torus. Quadrupole gravitational
radiation is radiated at about twice the Keplerian frequency of the torus,
which is non-axisymmetric when sufficiently slender, representing a ``{\em
black hole-blob}"" binary system or a ""{\em blob-blob}"" binary bound to the
central black hole. We here discuss line-broadening in the observed spectrum
due to Lense-Thirring precession, which modulates the orientation of the torus
to the line-of-sight. This spectral feature is long-lived, due to weak damping
of precessional motion. These events are believed to occur perhaps once per
year within a distance of 100Mpc, which provides a candidate source for
Advanced LIGO.

network of nodes joined by connectors. The nodes carry generalized charge that
may be randomly transferred from one node to another. Our goal is to find the
time evolution of the probability distribution of charges in the network. The
building blocks of our theoretical approach are (1) known probability
distributions for the connector currents, (2) physical constraints such as
local charge conservation, and (3) a time-scale separation between the slow
charge dynamics of the nodes and the fast current fluctuations of the
connectors. We derive a stochastic path integral representation of the
evolution operator for the slow charges. Once the probability distributions on
the discrete network have been studied, the continuum limit is taken to obtain
a statistical field theory. We find a correspondence between the diffusive
field theory and a Langevin equation with Gaussian noise sources, leading
nevertheless to non-trivial fluctuation statistics. To complete our theory, we
demonstrate that the cascade diagrammatics, recently introduced by Nagaev,
naturally follows from the stochastic path integral. We extend the
diagrammatics to calculate current correlation functions for an arbitrary
network. One primary application of this formalism is that of full counting
statistics (FCS). We stress however, that the formalism is suitable for general
classical stochastic problems as an alternative to the traditional master
equation or Doi-Peliti technique. The formalism is illustrated with several
examples: both instantaneous and time averaged charge fluctuation statistics in
a mesoscopic chaotic cavity, as well as the FCS and new results for a
generalized diffusive wire.

zigzag Heisenberg chains are investigated by means of the bond operator mean
field approximation. In the absence of the interchain coupling, this model is
known to have a plateau at half of the saturation magnetization accompanied by
the spontanuous translational symmetry breakdown. The parameter regime in which
the plateau appears is reproduced well within the present approximation. In the
presence of the interchain coupling, this plateau is shown to be suppressed.
This result is also supported by the numerical diagonalization calculation.

degree distribution dominated by a power-law behavior with a model-dependent,

network grows, a newly added node establishes $m$ new links to existing nodes
with a probability $p$ based on popularity of the existing nodes and a
probability $1-p$ based on fitness of the existing nodes. An explicit form of
the degree distribution $P(p,k)$ is derived within a mean field approach. For
reasonably large $k$, $P(p,k) \sim k^{-\gamma(p)}{\cal F}(k,p)$, where the
function ${\cal F}$ is dominated by the behavior of $1/\ln(k/m)$ for small
values of $p$ and becomes $k$-independent as $p \to 1$, and $\gamma(p)$ is a
model-dependent exponent. The degree distribution and the exponent $\gamma(p)$
are found to be in good agreement with results obtained by extensive numerical

parameter. The Drinfel'd-double and the Poisson-Lie structure underlying the

groups are obtained as quantizations of such Poisson-Lie algebras. As a
consequence, the non-commutative (2+1)D spacetimes that generalize the

noncommutative 4D spaces of (time-like) geodesics can be defined, and they can
be interpreted as a novel possibility to introduce non-commutative worldlines.
Furthermore, quantum (anti-)de Sitter algebras are presented both in the known
basis related with 2+1 quantum gravity and in a new one which generalizes the
bicrossproduct one. In this framework, the quantum deformation parameter is
related with the Planck length, and the existence of a kind of ""duality""

nucleon. A model of scalar $q \bar{q}$ ($^3P_0$) fluctuation in the non-trivial
QCD vacuum is used to calculate pion and kaon momentum distributions (MD) in
these channels.

of weakly-bound nuclei consisting of two halo neutrons and a core is performed
using a renormalized zero-range model. The radii are obtained from a universal
scaling function that depends on the mass ratio of the neutron and the core, as
well as on the nature of the subsystems, bound or virtual. Our calculations are
qualitatively consistent with recent data for the neutron-neutron
root-mean-square distance in the halo of $^{11}$Li and $^{14}$Be nuclei.

Department of Biological Systems Physics at the E. Andronikashvili Institute of
Physics, Georgian Academy of Sciences. This is the method of absolute heat
capacity measurement of the differential calorimetric ampoule sample and
reference cells and the adiabatic shell temperature difference registration
while stepwise alteration of temperature (increase or decrease) of system
occurs. The new method makes possible to determine both the heat capacities of
the sample and reference cells and their difference. The method of cell
temperature difference compensation is used in order to decrease in the time of
equilibrium establishment. The proposed method of absolute heat capacity
measurement was implemented in the model of the virtual differential pulse
reversible calorimeter.

by a continuous-time, linear, time invariant, finite dimensional system (LTI)
at steady state. In particular, we deal with the problem of network
reconstruction in the typical practical situation in which the number of
available data is largely insufficient to uniquely determine the network. In
order to try to remove this ambiguity, we will exploit the biologically a
priori assumption of network sparseness, and propose a new algorithm for
network reconstruction having a very low computational complexity (linear in
the number of genes) so to be able to deal also with very large networks (say,
thousands of genes). Its performances are also tested both on artificial data
(generated with linear models) and on real data obtained by Gardner et al. from
the SOS pathway in Escherichia coli.

self-assembly instructions. It may retain structure as it passes from one
individual to another, but does not replicate it. The cultural replicator is
not an idea but an associatively-structured network of them that together form
an internal model of the world, or worldview. A worldview is a primitive,
uncoded replicator, like the autocatalytic sets of polymers widely believed to
be the earliest form of life. Primitive replicators generate self-similar
structure, but because the process happens in a piecemeal manner, through
bottom-up interactions rather than a top-down code, they replicate with low
fidelity, and acquired characteristics are inherited. Just as polymers catalyze
reactions that generate other polymers, the retrieval of an item from memory
can in turn trigger other items, thus cross-linking memories, ideas, and
concepts into an integrated conceptual structure. Worldviews evolve idea by
idea, largely through social exchange. An idea participates in the evolution of
culture by revealing certain aspects of the worldview that generated it,
thereby affecting the worldviews of those exposed to it. If an idea influences
seemingly unrelated fields this does not mean that separate cultural lineages
are contaminating one another, because it is worldviews, not ideas, that are
the basic unit of cultural evolution.
