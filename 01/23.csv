into volume limited subsamples in order to examine the dependence of the higher

of the averaged p-point galaxy correlation functions, xibar_p, up to p=6. The
hierarchical amplitudes, S_p = xibar_p/xibar_2^{p-1}, are approximately
independent of the cell radius used to smooth the galaxy distribution on small

strongly affected by the presence of rare, massive superstructures in the

approximated by a linear dependence on log luminosity. We discuss the
implications of our results for simple models of linear and non-linear bias

4-15M_sun. This is compared with the mass distribution for black holes in
massive close binaries, which can be manifest as ultraluminous X-ray sources
(L_x > 10^39 erg/s) observed in other galaxies. If the X-ray luminosities of
these objects correspond to the Eddington limit, the black-hole mass
distribution should be described by a power law, which is incompatible with the
flat shape derived dynamically from observations of close binaries in our
Galaxy. One possible explanation of this discrepancy is the rapid evaporation
of stellar-mass black holes predicted in recent multi-dimensional models of

bright points through the analysis of Zeeman polarization in molecular CH
lines. To this end we solve the equations of polarized radiative transfer in
the G band through a standard plane-parallel model of the solar atmosphere with
an imposed magnetic field, and through a more realistic snapshot from a
simulation of solar magneto-convection. This region of the spectrum is crowded
with many atomic and molecular lines. Nevertheless, we find several instances
of isolated groups of CH lines that are predicted to produce a measurable
Stokes V signal in the presence of magnetic fields. In part this is possible
because the effective Land\'{e} factors of lines in the stronger main branch of
the CH A$^{2}\Delta$--X$^{2}\Pi$ transition tend to zero rather quickly for
increasing total angular momentum $J$, resulting in a Stokes $V$ spectrum of
the G band that is less crowded than the corresponding Stokes $I$ spectrum. We
indicate that, by contrast, the effective Land\'{e} factors of the $R$ and $P$
satellite sub-branches of this transition tend to $\pm 1$ for increasing $J$.
However, these lines are in general considerably weaker, and do not contribute
significantly to the polarization signal. In one wavelength location near 430.4
nm the overlap of several magnetically sensitive and non-sensitive CH lines is
predicted to result in a single-lobed Stokes $V$ profile, raising the
possibility of high spatial-resolution narrow-band polarimetric imaging. In the
magneto-convection snapshot we find circular polarization signals of the order
of 1% prompting us to conclude that measuring magnetic field strength in
small-scale elements through the Zeeman effect in CH lines is a realistic
prospect.

investigated, both theoretically and observationally. It appeared possible to
deduce this formula from general relativity, e. g., by application of a special
interpretation of gravito-magnetic theory. More consequences of the latter
theory for pulsars will be considered in this work. As an example, the standard
quadrupolar charge density for pulsars can be deduced from the gravito-magnetic
theory. Moreover, a new magnetic dipole moment from electromagnetic origin is
found, generated in the basic magnetic field from gravito-magnetic origin. In
general, for thirteen accreting, slowly rotating, binary pulsars the agreement
between the observed magnetic field and the gravito-magnetic prediction is
better than between the observed value and the value from the standard magnetic
dipole radiation model. At present, an analogous comparison for five isolated
pulsars appears to be difficult. For a sample of 100 pulsars the averaged
(gravito-)magnetic field, extracted from the magnetic dipole spin-down model,
is in fair agreement with the gravito-magnetic prediction. Unfortunately, the

consequence of heat flowing from the inner regions of the cluster both to its
outer parts and into its innermost resolved regions, the entropy profile is
altered as well. This effect is almost negligible for the cold cluster, as
expected based on the strong temperature dependence of the conductivity. Our
results demonstrate that while thermal conduction can have a significant

common on kpc-scales, with over half radio jets exhibiting at least one X-ray
knot on the Chandra images. The distributions of the radio-to-X-ray and
radio-to-optical spectral indices for the detected jets are similar to the
limits for the non-detections,suggesting all bright radio jets have X-ray
counterparts which will be visible in longer observations. Comparing the radio
and X-ray morphologies shows that the majority of the X-ray jets have
structures that closely map the radio. Analysis of the SED of the jet knots
suggest the knots in which the X-ray and radio morphologies track each other
produce X-rays by IC scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The
remaining knots produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. Spectral changes are
detected along the jets, with the ratio of the X-ray-to-radio and
optical-to-radio flux densities decreasing from the inner to the outer regions.
This suggests the presence of an additional contribution to the X-ray flux in
the jet's inner part, either from synchrotron or IC of the stellar light.
Alternatively, in a pure IC/CMB scenario, the plasma decelerates as it flows
from the inner to the outer regions. Finally, the X-ray spectral indices for
the brightest knots are flat, indicating that the bulk of the luminosity of the
jets is emitted at GeV energies, and raising the interesting possibility of
future detections with GLAST.

October as a moderately strong X-ray source that exhibited 18.7 s pulsations,
leading to an identification with the BATSE source GRO J1948+32, last detected
in 1994. We have analyzed Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations taken during
the 2000-01 outburst, as well as additional observations taken during a smaller
outburst in July 2002. Orbital Doppler shifts are apparent in the temporal
variation of the pulse frequency. A joint fit of the RXTE data together with
BATSE measurements from an outburst in 1994 yields the orbital period P_orb =
40.415+/-0.010 d, the projected orbital radius a_x sin i = 137+/-3 lt-s, and
the eccentricity e = 0.033+/-0.013. This degree of eccentricity is unexpectedly
low for such a wide orbit. Pulse timing results also show that the intrinsic
pulse frequency increased from 53.30 to 53.47 mHz at a rate approximately
proportional to the X-ray flux. This is about the degree of spin up expected
from the accretion torques that must be present when the X-ray luminosity
reaches ~10^38 ergs/s. On one occasion during the 2000-01 outburst, the pulse
frequency increased by ~1.8x10^-6 Hz in less than approximately 10 hr over and
above the mean trend seen around that time, without any indication of a
correspondingly large increase in X-ray flux. The fractional change in
frequency of 3.7x10^-5 during this event is significantly larger than the
values observed in the glitches in radio pulsars and anomalous X-ray pulsars.

Assuming the standard N(H2)/N(CO) ratio of 10^4, we find N(o-H2O)/N(H2) = 8.1 x
10^-8 - 4 x 10^-7 for three clouds with optically thin water lines. In three
additional clouds, the H$_2$O lines are saturated so we have used observations
of the H218O ground-state transition to find upper limits to the water
abundance of 8.2x 10^-8 - 1.5x10^-6. We measure the OH abundance from the
average of the 1665 and 1667 MHz observations and find N(OH)/N(H2) = 2.3x10^-7

line-of-sight water absorption features towards W51 and Sgr B2 but are higher
than those seen from water emission lines in molecular clouds. However, the
clouds towards W49 have lower ratios of OH relative to H2O column densities
than are predicted by simple models which assume that dissociative
recombination is the primary formation pathway for OH and H2O. Building on the
work of Neufeld et al. (2002), we present photo-chemistry models including
additional chemical effects, which can also explain the observed OH and H2O
column densities as well as the observed H2O/CO abundance ratios.

between pairs of knots at nearly equal distances from PV Ceph imply an E-W
motion of the source, and a plasmon model fit to the knot positions gives a
good fit of 22 km/s motion for the star. The second bit of damning evidence
comes from a redshifted ""trail"" of molecular gas, pointing in the same E-W
direction implied by the HH knot geometry. The third exhibit we offer in
accusing PV Ceph of speeding involves the tilt apparent in the high-velocity
molecular jet now emanating from the star. This tilt is best explained if the
true, current, jet direction is N-S, as it is in HST images, and the star is
moving at roughly 20 km/s. Tracing the motion of PV Ceph backward in time, to
the nearest cluster from which it might have been ejected, we find that it is
very likely to have been thrown out of the massive star-forming cluster NGC
7023 (more than 10 pc away). We propose that PV Ceph was ejected, at a speed
large enough to escape NGC 7023, at least 100,000 years ago, but that it did
not enter the molecular cloud in which it now finds itself until more like
35,000 years ago. Our calculations show that the currently-observable molecular
outflow associated with PV Ceph is about 10,000 years old, so that the flow has
had plenty of time to form while in its current molecular cloud. But, the
question of what PV Ceph was doing, and what gas/disk it took along with it in
the time it was traveling through the low-density region between NGC 7023 and

model atmospheres. The best fit was found for Teff=14000K, log g = 3.5, and v
sin i = 170km/s. These values together with a Hipparcos parallax lead to a
stellar mass M=4.8+-0.8 M_solar and radius R=6.4+-0.5 R_solar. Long-term
variations of kappa Dra were analysed using measurements of equivalent widths,
central intensities, peak intensities of emission lines and emission peak
velocity differences for H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta, and some helium,
silicon, and iron lines. It turned out that the previously reported period of
23 years in the variation of the emission strength is probably a cyclic, not a
strictly periodic phenomenon. An attempt to find out a period from all
available records of the H-beta emission strength led to a value of 8044+-167
days (22.0 years) but the phase plots show that each cycle has a different
shape and length. For the moment, the nature and origin of the disk around
kappa Dra still remains unknown. From the comparison of the electronic spectra
obtained at different phases of the long-term cycle and synthetic spectra it
appears that there are no detectable changes in the photospheric part of the
Balmer lines related to variations in the Balmer emission strength which could
be attributed to an extended photosphere corresponding to inner parts of the
disk, optically thick in continuum.

past has been significantly underestimated. The width of the Main Sequence is
mainly interpreted in terms of differential reddening, and indeed the stars'
color excess $E_{B-V}$ ranges from 0.43 to 0.65, implying the presence of a
significant and evenly distributed dust component. We cross-correlate our
optical photometry with near infrared from 2MASS, and by means of spectral
classification we are able to build up extinction curves for an handful of
bright members. We find that the reddening slope and the total to selective
absorption ratio $R_V$ toward NGC 6996 are anomalous. Moreover the reddening
corrected colors and magnitudes allow us to derive estimates for the cluster
distance and age, which turn out to be $760 \pm 70 pc$ ($V_{0}-M_{V} = 9.4 \pm
0.2$) and $\sim 350$ Myr, respectively. Basing on our results, we suggest that

those with an almost flat spectral energy distribution in the mid-infrared
(`group I'), and those with a strong decline towards the far-infrared (`group
II'). In this paper we show that the group I vs. II distinction can be
understood as arising from flaring vs. self-shadowed disks. We show that these
two types of disks are natural solutions of the 2-D radiation-hydrostatic
structure equations. Disks with high optical depth turn out to be flaring and
have a strong far-IR emission, while disks with an optical depth below a
certain threshold drop into the shadow of their own puffed-up inner rim and are
weak in the far-IR. In spite of not having a directly irradiated surface layer,
self-shadowed disks still display dust features in emission, in agreement with
observations of group II sources. We propose an evolutionary scenario in which
a disk starts out with a flaring shape (group I source), and then goes through
the process of grain growth, causing the optical depth of the disk to drop and
the disk to become self-shadowed (group II source). We show that this scenario
predicts that the (sub-)millimeter slope of the disk changes from steep (small
grains) to Rayleigh-Jeans-like (large grains) in the early stages of evolution,
so that all group II sources are expected to have Rayleigh-Jeans-like slopes,
while some group I sources may still have steep (sub-)millimeter slopes.

spectra similar to those of Seyfert 2 galaxies in which polarized broad-lines

far-field scattering in the polar illumination cones of the circum-nuclear
torus. We estimate that they represent between 10 and 30 per cent of the
Seyfert 1 population; they are found amongst all the main spectroscopic
sub-types, including narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. We have shown elsewhere
that Seyfert 1 nuclei more commonly have polarization characteristics that can
be attributed to scattering by a compact 'equatorial' scattering region located
inside the torus. We propose that both equatorial and polar scattering regions
are present in all Seyfert galaxies and argue that the observed range of
polarization properties can be broadly understood as an orientation effect. In
this scheme, polar-scattered Seyfert 1 galaxies represent the transition
between unobscured (the majority of type 1) and obscured (type 2) Seyferts.
They are viewed through the upper layers of the torus and are thus subject to
moderate extinction (Av ~1-4 mag) sufficient to suppress polarized light from
the equatorial scattering region, but not the broad wings of the Balmer lines.
The orientation of the polarization position angle relative to the radio source
is broadly consistent with the two-component scattering model. More generally,
we find that amongst Seyferts 1 galaxies, parallel, perpendicular and
intermediate orientations of the polarization PA relative to the radio axis
occur roughly in the proportions 2:1:1.

that the spin modulation of the neutron star is weak or absent in the low state

higher intensity, we observe a substructure in the broad soft X-ray modulation
below ~1keV, revealing the presence of separate peaks which reflect the
structure seen at higher energies. The strong fluorescence emission line at
~6.4keV is detected in all observations (apart from one taken in the middle of
eclipse), with higher line energy, width and normalisation during the main-on
state. In addition, we report the detection of a second line near 7keV in 10 of
the 15 observations taken during the low-intensity states of the system. This
feature is rather weak and not significantly detected during the main-on state,
when the strong continuum emission dominates the X-ray spectrum. Spin resolved
spectroscopy just after the rise to the main-on state shows that the variation
of the Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV is correlated with the soft X-ray emission.
This confirms our past finding based on the XMM-Newton observations made
further into the main-on state, and indicates the common origin for the thermal
component and the Fe Kalpha line detected at these phases. We also find that
the normalisation of the 6.4keV line during the low state is correlated with
the binary orbital phase, having a broad maximum centered near phi_(orbit) ~
0.5. We discuss these observations in the context of previous observations,
investigate the origin of the soft and hard X-rays and consider the emission
site of the 6.4keV and 7keV emission lines.

the small spread in the [el/Fe] ratios in the metallicity range from

Significant evolutionary effects were found for redshifts 2 < z < 4. Most
conspicuous are the increase of the average C IV absorption strength, of the
dust reddening, and of the intrinsic UV luminosity, and the decrease of the
average Ly alpha emission strength with decreasing redshift. In part the
observed evolutionary effects can be attributed to an increase of the
metallicity of the galaxies with cosmic age. Moreover, the increase of the
total star-formation rates and the stronger obscuration of the starburst cores
by dusty gas clouds suggest the occurrence of more massive starbursts at later
cosmic epochs.

found also at the three UMRAO frequencies and the Scargle (1982) method yields
an extremely low false-alarm probability. On the other hand, the 22 and 37 GHz
periodicities of 0224+671 and 0945+408 (which were less extensively monitored
at Metsahovi and for which we get a significant false-alarm probability) are
not confirmed by the UMRAO database, where some indications of ill-defined
periods about a factor of two longer are retrieved. We have also investigated
the variability index, the structure function, and the distribution of
intensity variations of the most extensively monitored sources. We find a
statistically significant difference in the distribution of the variability
index for BL Lac objects compared to flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), in
the sense that the former objects are more variable. For both populations the
variability index steadily increases with increasing frequency. The
distribution of intensity variations also broadens with increasing frequency,
and approaches a log-normal shape at the highest frequencies. We find that
variability enhances by 20-30% the high frequency counts of extragalactic
radio-sources at bright flux densities, such as those of the WMAP and Planck

every cluster contains between 40 and 400 blue stragglers. The population does
not correlate with either stellar collision rate (as would be expected if all
blue stragglers were formed via collisions) or total mass (as would be expected
if all blue stragglers were formed via the unhindered evolution of a subset of
the stellar population). In this paper, we support the idea that blue
stragglers are made through both channels. The number produced via collisions
tends to increase with cluster mass. In this paper we show how the current
population produced from primordial binaries decreases with increasing cluster
mass; exchange encounters with third, single, stars in the most massive
clusters tend to reduce the fraction of binaries containing a primary close to
the current turn-off mass. Rather their primaries tend to be somewhat more
massive (~1-3 M_sun) and have evolved off the main sequence, filling their
Roche lobes in the past, often converting their secondaries into blue
stragglers (but more than 1 Gyr or so ago and thus they are no longer visible
as blue stragglers). We show that this decline in the primordial blue straggler
population is likely to be offset by the increase in the number of blue
stragglers produced via collisions. The predicted total blue straggler
population is therefore relatively independent of cluster mass, thus matching
the observed population. This result does not depend on any particular assumed
blue straggler lifetime.

V~100 km/s. Smaller galaxies tend to be blue disks of young populations. They
define a ""fundamental line"" of decreasing surface brightness, metallicity and
velocity with decreasing M_*, which extends to the smallest dwarf galaxies.
Galaxies above the critical scale are dominated by red spheroids of old
populations, with roughly constant high surface brightens and metallicity, and
they tend to host AGNs. A minimum in the virial M/L is obtained at the same
magic scale. This bi-modality can be the combined imprint of several different
physical processes. On smaller scales, disks are built by cold flows, and
supernova feedback is effective in regulating star formation. On larger scales,
the infalling gas is heated by a virial shock and star formation can be
suppressed by AGN feedback. Another feedback mechanism -- gas evaporation due
to photo-ionization -- may explain the existence of totally dark halos below
V~30 km/s. The standard cooling barriers are responsible for the loose upper

the standard assumption that dark energy does not cluster on the scales of

that the predictions of the spherical collapse model depend on the potential
used. We also investigate the dependence on the initial conditions. Secondly,
we investigate in how far perturbations in the quintessence field affect the
predictions of the spherical collapse model. In doing so, we assume that the
field collapses along with the dark matter. Although the field is still
subdominant at the time of virialisation, the predictions are different from
the case of a homogeneous dark energy component. This will in particular be
true if the field is non--minimally coupled. We conclude that a better
understanding of the evolution of dark energy in the highly non--linear regime
is needed in order to make predictions using the spherical collapse model in

metastable solubility limit for which only few experimental data are available.
The purpose of this study is to obtain by ab-initio calculations the solubility
limit of Zr in Al for the stable as well as the metastable phase diagrams. The
formation energies of several ordered compounds AlxZr(1 x), all based on an fcc
underlying lattice, were calculated using the FP-LMTO (Full Potential Linear Mu
n Tin Orbital) method. Taking into account all the relaxations allowed by the
symmetry, we found the DO23 structure to be the stable one for Al3Zr. This set
of results was then used with the cluster expansion in order to fit a
generalized Ising model through the inverse method of Connolly-Williams. Di
erent ways to consider volume relaxations were examined. This allowed us to
calculate in the Bragg-Williams approximation the configurational free energy
at finite temperature. According to the previous FP-LMTO calculations the free
energy due to electronic excitations can be neglected. For the vibrational free
energy of ordered structures we compared results obtained from a calculation of
the elastic constants used with the Debye model and results obtained from a
calculation of the phonon spectrum. All these di erent steps lead to a
calculation of the solubility limit of Zr in Al which is found to be lower than
the experimental one. The solubility limit in the metastable phase diagram is
calculated in the same way and can thus be compared to the stable one.

We show that for growth models in the MBE universality class, the nonlinearity
of the underlying dynamical equation is clearly reflected in the difference
between the measured values of the positive and negative persistence exponents
in both transient and steady-state regimes. For the MBE universality class, the
positive and negative persistence exponents in the steady-state are found to be

reduction technique is applied on some of the (1+1)-dimensional models in order
to obtain accurate values of the persistence exponents. We show analytically
that a relation between the steady-state persistence exponent and the dynamic
growth exponent, found earlier to be valid for linear models, should be
satisfied by the smaller of the two steady-state persistence exponents in the
nonlinear models. Our numerical results for the persistence exponents are
consistent with this prediction. We also find that the steady-state persistence
exponents can be obtained from simulations over times that are much shorter
than that required for the interface to reach the steady state. The dependence
of the persistence probability on the system size and the sampling time is
shown to be described by a simple scaling form.

  Single Crystal LiNiPO$_4$",,,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.207201",,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  Neutron scattering studies of single-crystal LiNiPO$_4$ reveal a spontaneous
first-order commensurate-incommensurate magnetic phase transition. Short- and
long-range incommensurate phases are intermediate between the high temperature
paramagnetic and the low temperature antiferromagnetic phases. The modulated
structure has a predominant antiferromagnetic component, giving rise to
satellite peaks in the vicinity of the fundamental antiferromagnetic Bragg
reflection, and a ferromagnetic component giving rise to peaks at small
momentum-transfers around the origin at $(0,\pm Q,0)$. The wavelength of the
modulated magnetic structure varies continuously with temperature. It is argued
that the incommensurate short- and long-range phases are due to
spin-dimensionality crossover from a continuous to the discrete Ising state.
These observations explain the anomalous first-order transition seen in the
magnetoelectric effect of this system.

leads to ambiguities of whether classical or dressed ones should be employed at

generalization to the Standard Model of the procedure recently applied to the

techniques, II. the mathematically rigorous framework of Algebraic Quantum
Field Theory (AQFT) and III. the theory of integrable systems resulting in the
invariant Pohlmeyer Charges in order to set up the general representation
theory (superselection theory) for the closed bosonic quantum string on flat
target space. While we do not solve the, expectedly, rich representation theory
completely, we present a, to the best of our knowledge new, non -- trivial
solution to the representation problem. This solution exists 1. for any target
space dimension, 2. for Minkowski signature of the target space, 3. without
tachyons, 4. manifestly ghost -- free (no negative norm states), 5. without
fixing a worldsheet or target space gauge, 6. without (Virasoro) anomalies
(zero central charge), 7. while preserving manifest target space Poincar\'e
invariance and 8. without picking up UV divergences. The existence of this
stable solution is exciting because it raises the hope that among all the
solutions to the representation problem (including fermionic degrees of
freedom) we find stable, phenomenologically acceptable ones in lower
dimensional target spaces, possibly without supersymmetry, that are much
simpler than the solutions that arise via compactification of the standard Fock
representation of the string. Moreover, these new representations could solve
some of the major puzzles of string theory such as the cosmological constant
problem. The solution presented in this paper exploits the flatness of the
target space in several important ways. In a companion paper we treat the more
complicated case of curved target spaces.

q^*(n)=\max_{i\le n}q(i), which is the least monotone nondecreasing function
bounding q(n) from above, we have q^*(n)=(1+o(1))\log^*n, where \log^*n equals
the minimum number of iterations of the binary logarithm sufficient to lower n

  We show an upper bound q(n)<\log^*n+5 even under the restriction of the class

both significant improvement in baseline length repeatability and noticeable
reduction in the amplitude of the residual harmonic site position variations at

reduction in the observed mean square deviations achieves 80 of the maximum

of the molecules have significantly different infrared and Raman signatures,
and so these spectra could be used in situ to non-destructively identify the
monomeric content of macromolecules. It is hoped that this may be a helpful
