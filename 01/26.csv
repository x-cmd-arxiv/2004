This starts from previous works, leading to the tentative identification of the
Accretion-Ejection Instability as the source of the low-frequency
Quasi-Periodic Oscillation of microquasars and other accreting sources. We
follow the physics of this instability: its conditions (the magnetic field and
geometry adapted to MHD jet models), its instability criterion, and its
consequences (cooling down of the disk, heating and excitation of the corona).
Comparing them to the observed properties of the source, in particular the
detailed properties of its spectral states, we first derive a model for the
$\sim$ 30 minutes cycles often exhibited by GRS 1915+105. In our model this is
a limit cycle determined by the advection of poloidal magnetic flux to the
inner region of the disk, and its destruction by reconnection (leading to
relativistic ejections) with the magnetic flux trapped in the vicinity of the
central source. We show how it leads to natural explanations for observed
behaviors of GRS 1915+105, including the three basic states of Belloni et al
(2000). We then discuss how this could be extrapolated further to understand
the longer-term variability of this and other microquasars.

sequence in the Color Magnitude Diagram of omega Cen. This feature appears as a
narrow, well-defined Sub Giant Branch (SGB-a), which merges into the Main
Sequence of the dominant cluster population at a magnitude significantly
fainter than the cluster Turn-Off (TO). The simplest hypothesis assumes that
the new feature is the extension of the anomalous Red Giant Branch (RGB-a)
metal-rich population discovered by Lee et al. (1999) and Pancino et al.
(2000). However, under this assumption the interpretation of the SGB-a does not
easily fit into the context of a self-enrichment scenario within omega Cen. In
fact, its TO magnitude, shape and extension are not compatible with a young,
metal-rich population, as required by the self-enrichment process. The TO level
of the SGB-a suggests indeed an age as old as the main cluster population,
further supporting the extra-cluster origin of the most metal rich stars, as
suggested by Ferraro, Bellazzini & Pancino (2002). Only accurate measurements
of radial velocities and metal abundances for a representative sample of stars
will firmly establish whether or not the SGB-a is actually related to the RGB-a
and will finally shed light on the origin of the metal rich population of omega
Cen.

formation scenario in which seed holes of intermediate mass form far up in the

z=20 to the present in a LCDM cosmology. MBHs get incorporated through halo
mergers into larger and larger structures, sink to the center owing to
dynamical friction against the DM background, accrete cold material in the
merger remnant, and form MBH binary systems. Stellar dynamical interactions
cause the hardening of the binary at large separations, while gravitational
wave emission takes over at small radii and leads to the final coalescence of
the pair. The integrated emission from inspiraling MBH binaries results in a
gravitational wave background (GWB). The characteristic strain spectrum has the
standard h_c(f)\propto f^{-2/3} behavior only in the range 1E-9<f<1E-6 Hz. At
lower frequencies the orbital decay of MBH binaries is driven by the ejection
of background stars, and h_c(f) \propto f. At higher frequencies, f>1E-6 Hz,
the strain amplitude is shaped by the convolution of last stable circular orbit
emission. We discuss the observability of inspiraling MBH binaries by the
planned LISA. Over a 3-year observing period LISA should resolve this GWB into
discrete sources, detecting ~60 (~250) individual events above a S/N=5 (S/N=1)

derive analytic expressions for these power spectra in the linear and nonlinear

the linear regime, redshift distortions enhance the 1D power spectra only on
small scales, and do not affect the power on large scales. This is in contrast
to the effect of distortions on three-dimensional (3D) power spectra estimated
from data in 3D space, where the enhancement is independent of scale. For CDM
cosmologies, the 1D power spectra in redshift and real space are similar for
wavenumbers $q<0.1h/Mpc$ where both have a spectral index close to unity,
independent of the details of the 3D power spectrum. Nonlinear corrections
drive the 1D power spectrum in redshift space into a nearly universal shape
over scale $q<10h/Mpc$, and suppress the power on small scales as a result of
the strong velocity shear and random motions. The redshift space, 1D power
spectrum is mostly sensitive to the amplitude of the initial density
perturbations. Our results are useful in particular for power spectra computed
from the SDSS quasars sample.

allows to overcome a fundamental ambiguity contained in the canonical approach
to quantum gravity: the possibility of performing a (3+1)-slicing of

provides also a procedure to solve the problems connected to the so called
""frozen formalism"". In particular we fix the reference frame (i.e. the lapse
function and the shift vector) by introducing the so called ""kinematical
action""; as a consequence, the new hamiltonian constraints become parabolic, so
arriving to evolutive (Schroedinger-like) equations for the quantum dynamics.
The kinematical action can be interpreted as the action of a pressureless, but,
in general, non geodesic perfect fluid, so in the semi classical limit our
theory leads to the dynamics of the gravitational field coupled to a dust which
represents the material reference frame we have introduced fixing the slicing.
We also investigate the cosmological implications of the presence of the dust,
which, in the WKB limit of a cosmological problem, makes account for a ""dark

contribution to the center-edge asymmetry, whereas at the LHC, the dominant
contribution comes from gluon fusion via graviton exchange, which has no
analogue at e^+ e^- colliders. We find that spin-2 and spin-1 exchange can be
distinguished up to an ADD cut-off scale, M_H, of about 5 TeV, at the 95% CL.
In the RS scenario, spin-2 resonances can be identified in most of the favored
parameter space.

relic anti-neutrinos (and vice versa) into Z-bosons leads to sizable absorption
dips in the neutrino flux to be observed at Earth. The high-energy edges of
these dips are fixed, via the resonance energies, by the neutrino masses alone.
Their depths are determined by the cosmic neutrino background density, by the
cosmological parameters determining the expansion rate of the universe, and by
the large redshift history of the cosmic neutrino sources. We investigate the
possibility of determining the existence of the cosmic neutrino background
within the next decade from a measurement of these absorption dips in the
neutrino flux. As a by-product, we study the prospects to infer the absolute
neutrino mass scale. We find that, with the presently planned neutrino
detectors (ANITA, Auger, EUSO, OWL, RICE, and SalSA) operating in the relevant
energy regime above 10^{21} eV, relic neutrino absorption spectroscopy becomes
a realistic possibility. It requires, however, the existence of extremely
powerful neutrino sources, which should be opaque to nucleons and high-energy
photons to evade present constraints. Furthermore, the neutrino mass spectrum
must be quasi-degenerate to optimize the dip, which implies m_{nu} >~ 0.1 eV
for the lightest neutrino. With a second generation of neutrino detectors,
these demanding requirements can be relaxed considerably.

information-theoretic arguments. The nonlinearities are controlled by an
intrinsic length scale and involve derivatives to all orders thus making the
equation mildly nonlocal. The nonlinear equation is homogeneous, separable,
conserves probability, but is not invariant under spacetime symmetries.
Spacetime symmetries are recovered when a dimensionless parameter is tuned to
vanish, whereby linearity is simultaneously established and the length scale
becomes hidden. It is thus suggested that if, in the search for a more basic
foundation for Nature's Laws, an inference principle is given precedence over
symmetry requirements, then the symmetries of spacetime and the linearity of
quantum theory might both be emergent properties that are intrinsically linked.
Supporting arguments are provided for this point of view and some testable
phenomenological consequences highlighted. The generalised Klien-Gordon and
Dirac equations are also studied, leading to the suggestion that nonlinear
quantum dynamics with intrinsically broken spacetime symmetries might be
relevant to understanding the problem of neutrino mass(lessness) and
oscillations: Among other observations, this approach hints at the existence of
a hidden discrete family symmetry in the Standard Model of particle physics.

data files co-located with the CPUs where the analysis is meant to take place.
Large I/O intensive data analyses may thus be efficiently conducted on multiple

this Scheduler was developed specifically for the STAR Collaboration at

adapted to virtually any other data analysis tasks carried out by large

conversion is delayed the energy released can power a Gamma Ray Burst. A delay
between the Supernova and the subsequent Gamma Ray Burst is possible, in
agreement with the delay proposed in recent analysis of astrophysical data.

dependence of S factors of astrophysically relevant two-body reactions. This is
accomplished by studying closely related three-body reactions under quasi-free
scattering conditions. The basic theory of the Trojan-Horse method is developed
starting from a post-form distorted wave Born approximation of the T-matrix
element. In the surface approximation the cross section of the three-body
reaction can be related to the S-matrix elements of the two-body reaction. The
essential feature of the Trojan-Horse method is the effective suppression of
the Coulomb barrier at low energies for the astrophysical reaction leading to
finite cross sections at the threshold of the two-body reaction. In a modified
plane wave approximation the relation between the two-body and three-body cross
sections becomes very transparent. Applications of the Trojan Horse Method are
discussed. It is of special interest that electron screening corrections are
negligible due to the high projectile energy.

  Trends in International Fusion Research: A Review"" March 24-28, 2003,
  Washington, D.C V.2 corrected typos",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  Fusion with p11B has many advantages, including the almost complete lack of
radioactivity and the possibility of direct conversion of charged particle
energy to electricity, without expensive steam turbines and generators. But two
major challenges must be overcome to achieve this goal: obtaining average ion
energies well above 100keV and minimizing losses by bremsstrahlung x-rays.
Recent experimental and theoretical work indicates that these challenges may be
overcome with the dense plasma focus. DPF experiments at Texas A&M University
have demonstrated ion and electron average energies above 100keV in
several-micron-sized hot-spots or plasmoids. These had
density-confinement-time-energy products as high as 5.0 x10^15 keVsec/cm^3. In
these experiments we clearly distinguished between x-rays coming from the
hot-spots and the harder radiation coming from electron beam collisions with
the anode. In addition, new theoretical work shows that extremely high magnetic
fields, which appear achievable in DPF plasmoids, will strongly reduce
collisional energy transfer from ions to electrons. This reduction has been
studied in the context of neutron stars and occurs when ion velocities are too
small to efficiently excite electron transitions between Landau levels. It
becomes a major effect for fields above 5 gigagauss. This effect will allow
average electron energies to stay far below average ion energies and will thus
reduce x-ray cooling of p11B. In this case, fusion power will very
significantly exceed x-ray emitted power. While fields of only 0.4 gigagauss
have so far been demonstrated with the DPF, scaling laws indicate that much
higher fields can be reached.

accommodated within our scheme. The geometry of our N x N phase space also
leads naturally to a method of constructing a complete set of N+1 mutually
