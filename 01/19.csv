sources, which are now observed at radio, optical and X-ray frequencies, in
order to determine the origin of their X-ray radiation and the nature of the
particle acceleration responsible for their multiwavelength emission. We show
that modeling knots of the these objects as stationary regions of energy
dissipation within the uniform and continuous jet flow leads to several
problems. Such problems are especially pronounced if the observed X-ray
emission is due to inverse-Compton scattering of the CMB radiation. We explore
another possibility, namely that the knots represent moving and separate
portions of the jet matter, with excess kinetic power. We suggest a possible
connection between this scenario and the idea of intermittent/highly modulated
jet activity. The proposed model can explain some morphological properties of
quasar jets -- like high knot-to-interknot brightness contrasts,
frequency-independent knot profiles and almost universal extents of the knot
regions -- independently of the exact emission mechanism responsible for
producing the X-rays. In this context, we consider different possibilities for
the production of such X-ray radiation, and discuss the related issue of
particle acceleration. We conclude that the appropriate process cannot be
designated for certain yet. We suggest, however, that X-ray observations of the
jet in 3C 120 (in which intermittent jet activity is quite distinct) already
seem to support the synchrotron origin of the X-ray emission, at least in this
object.

generalize the calculations for arbitrary lens velocities and show that, to

discuss the seeming inconsistency of relativistic light deflection with the
classical picture of moving test particles by generalizing the lens effect to
test particles of arbitrary velocity, including light as a limiting case. We
show that the effect of radial motion of the lens is very different for slowly
moving test particles and light and that a critical test particle velocity
exists for which the motion of the lens has no effect on the deflection angle
to first order. An interesting and not immediately intuitive result is obtained
in the limit of a highly relativistic motion of the lens towards the observer,
where the deflection angle of light reduces to zero. This phenomenon is
elucidated in terms of moving refractive media. Furthermore, we discuss the
dragging of inertial frames in the field of a moving lens and the corresponding
Lense-Thirring precession, in order to shed more light on the geometrical
effects in the surroundings of a moving mass. In a second part we discuss the
effect of transversal motion on the observed redshift of lensed sources. We
demonstrate how a simple kinematic calculation explains the effects for
arbitrary velocities of the lens and test particles. Additionally we include
the transversal motion of the source and observer to show that all three
velocities can be combined into an effective relative transversal velocity
similar to the approach used in microlensing studies.

clumpiness of the inner-most hot dust in the envelopes, and to measure the
diameters of the underlying stars themselves. We find evidence for large-scale
inhomogeneities in some dust shells and also significant deviations from
uniform brightness for the photospheres of the most evolved M-stars. Deviations
from spherically-symmetric mass loss in the red supergiant NML Cyg could be
related to recent evidence for dynamically-important magnetic fields and/or
stellar rotation. We point out that dust shell asymmetries, like those observed
here, can qualitatively explain the difficulty recent workers have had in
simultaneously fitting the broad-band spectral energy distributions and
high-resolution spatial information, without invoking unusual dust properties
or multiple distinct shells (from hypothetical ``superwinds''). This paper is
the first to combine optical interferometry data from multiple facilities for

the exponential profiles of normal galaxies. Although the most extreme of the
linear objects look like beaded filaments, they are all probably edge-on disks
that will evolve to late Hubble type galaxies. The lack of an exponential
profile is either the result of a dust scale height that is comparable to the
stellar scale height, or an intrinsically irregular structure. Examples of
galaxies that could be face-on versions of linear galaxies are shown. They have
an irregular clumpy structure with no central bulge and with clump colors and
magnitudes that are comparable to those in the linears. Radiative transfer
solutions to the magnitudes and surface brightnesses of inclined dusty galaxies
suggest that edge-on disks should become more prominent near the detection

edge-on galaxies in this field confirm this selection effect. The star

probability of default (PD) in different economic sectors. Often, PD
correlations have to be estimated from relatively short time series of default
rates, and the resulting estimation error hinders the detection of a signal. We
present statistical evidence that PD correlations are well described by a
(one-)factorial model. We suggest a method of parameter estimation which avoids
in a controlled way the underestimation of correlation risk. Empirical evidence
is presented that, in the framework of the CreditRisk+ model with integrated
correlations, this method leads to an increased reliability of the economic

frequency near the CN. The system exhibits vacuum-field Rabi oscillations, a
principal signature of strong atom-vacuum-field coupling, when the atom is
close enough to the nanotube surface and the atomic transition frequency is in
the vicinity of the resonance of the photonic density of states. Caused by
decreasing the atom-field coupling strength, the non-exponential decay dynamics
gives place to the exponential one if the atom moves away from the CN surface.
Thus, atom-field coupling and the character of the spontaneous decay dynamics,
respectively, may be controlled by changing the distance between the atom and

routes for new challenging nanophotonics applications of atomically doped CN

wormholes in the presence of a generic cosmological constant. We find that for
large positive values of the cosmological constant, i.e., the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter solution, the regions of stability significantly increase relatively to
the Schwarzschild case, analyzed by Poisson and Visser. Secondly, we construct
static thin shell solutions by matching an interior wormhole solution to a
vacuum exterior solution at a junction surface. In the spirit of minimizing the
usage of exotic matter we analyze the domains in which the weak and null energy
conditions are satisfied at the junction surface. The characteristics and
several physical properties of the surface stresses are explored, namely, we
determine regions where the sign of tangential surface pressure is positive and
negative (surface tension). An equation governing the behavior of the radial
pressure across the junction surface is deduced. Specific dimensions of the
wormhole, namely, the throat radius and the junction interface radius, are
found by taking into account the traversability conditions, and estimates for
the traversal time and velocity are also determined.

is asymptotically ""no"". For finite numbers of spins, N, we do not know the
answer. We also show that any frame of reference which we can consider to be
classical must use some resource which is exponentially large in N. This gives
a quantitative meaning to the idea that classical objects are big.

A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.70.032702",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider a pair of identical two-level atoms interacting with a scalar
field in one dimension, separated by a distance $x_{21}$. We restrict our
attention to states where one atom is excited and the other is in the ground
state, in symmetric or anti-symmetric combinations. We obtain exact collective
decaying states, belonging to a complex spectral representation of the
Hamiltonian. The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues give the decay rates, and
the real parts give the average energy of the collective states. In one
dimension there is strong interference between the fields emitted by the atoms,
leading to long-range cooperative effects. The decay rates and the energy
oscillate with the distance $x_{21}$. Depending on $x_{21}$, the decay rates
will either decrease, vanish or increase as compared with the one-atom decay
rate. We have sub- and super-radiance at periodic intervals. Our model may be
used to study two-cavity electron wave-guides. The vanishing of the collective
decay rates then suggests the possibility of obtaining stable configurations,
where an electron is trapped inside the two cavities.

coherent and squeezed states of light are representations of the Lorentz group.
The Lorentz group is also the basic underlying language for classical ray

The operation of the proposed logic gates involves metastable states of the

extended to produce multiparticle entanglement.

the rotation gate. Error probability was estimated to be 0.01 per qubit, which
corresponded to error-free operation on 100 qubits. The error probability can
be further reduced by taking the majority of the accumulated results. The
reduction of error probability resulted in a successful QFT demonstration on

in three dimensions. In this model, the ""gauge coupling"" for each plaquette is
a quenched random variable that takes the value \beta with the probability 1-p
and -\beta with the probability p. This model is relevant for the recently
proposed quantum memory of toric code. The parameter p is the concentration of
the plaquettes with ""wrong-sign"" couplings -\beta, and interpreted as the error
probability per qubit in quantum code. In the gauge system with p=0, i.e., with
the uniform gauge couplings \beta, it is known that there exists a second-order
phase transition at a certain critical ""temperature"", T(\equiv \beta^{-1}) =
T_c =1.31, which separates an ordered(Higgs) phase at T<T_c and a
disordered(confinement) phase at T>T_c. As p increases, the critical
temperature T_c(p) decreases. In the p-T plane, the curve T_c(p) intersects
with the Nishimori line T_{N}(p) at the certain point (p_c, T_{N}(p_c)). The
value p_c is just the accuracy threshold for a fault-tolerant quantum memory
and associated quantum computations. By the Monte-Carlo simulations, we
calculate the specific heat and the expectation values of the Wilson loop to
obtain the phase-transition line T_c(p) numerically. The accuracy threshold is
estimated as p_c \simeq 0.033.

interacting fermions in the light of strength functions and their participation
ratio and information entropy. For weakly interacting fermions in a mean-field
with random two-body interactions of increasing strength $\lambda$, the
strength functions $F_k(E)$ are well known to change, in the regime where level
fluctuations follow Wigner's surmise, from Breit-Wigner to Gaussian form. We
propose an ansatz for the function describing this transition which we use to
investigate the participation ratio $\xi_2$ and the information entropy $S^{\rm
info}$ during this crossover, thereby extending the known behavior valid in the
Gaussian domain into much of the Breit-Wigner domain. Our method also allows us
to derive the scaling law for the duality point $\lambda = \lambda_d$, where
$F_k(E)$, $\xi_2$ and $S^{\rm info}$ in both the weak ($\lambda=0$) and strong
mixing ($\lambda = \infty$) basis coincide as $\lambda_d \sim 1/\sqrt{m}$,
where $m$ is the number of fermions. As an application, the ansatz function for
strength functions is used in describing the Breit-Wigner to Gaussian
transition seen in neutral atoms CeI to SmI with valence electrons changing
from 4 to 8.
