over the years to explain the QPOs and the rich phenomenology accompanying

conflict with the most recent observations. We here propose a new, simple model
in which the QPOs result from basic p-mode oscillations of a non-Keplerian disc
of finite size. We show that within this new model all of the key properties of
the QPOs: a) harmonic ratios of frequencies even as the frequencies change; b)
variations in the relative strength of the frequencies with spectral energy

intensity ratio of a given pair of jet to counter-jet knots is over-predicted
by the above formalism compared with the intensity ratio actually measured from

predicts an intensity ratio of about 185, whereas the observed intensity ratio
at one single epoch is about 3. Mirabel and Rodriguez (1999) have refined the
original formalism, and suggested measuring the intensity ratio of knots when
they are at equal angular separations from the nucleus. This method is only
applicable where there is sufficient time-sampling with sufficient physical
resolution to interpolate the intensities of the knots at equal distances from
the nucleus, and can therefore be difficult to apply to microquasars and is
impossible to apply to quasars. Accounting for both the light-travel time
between the knots and the simple evolution of the knots themselves reconciles
this over-prediction and renders the original formalism obsolete.

matter with a phase transition to quark matter at very high densities. Binary
equilibrium sequences close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are
calculated to determine the GW frequencies just before merger. It is found that
EoS effects begin to play a role for gravitational masses larger than
$M_\infty\simeq1.5M_\odot$. The difference in the gravitational wave frequency
at the ISCO grows to up to $\simeq 10%$ for the maximal allowed mass given by
the EoSs used. Then, we perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations for each EoS
varying the initial mass and determine the characteristic GW frequencies of the
merger remnants. The implications of quark matter show up mainly in a different
collapse behaviour of the merger remnant. If the collapse does not take place
immediately after merger, we find a phase difference between two EoS's in the
post-merger GW signal. We also compare the GW frequencies emitted by the merger
remnant to values from simulations using a polytropic EoS and find an imprint
of the non-constant adiabatic index of our EoSs. All calculations are based on
the conformally flat (CF) approximation to general relativity and the GW signal

Sedov-Taylor model for outflows, we are able to make robust statements about
their impact of on structure formation. As large regions of the IGM are heated
above a critical entropy of approximately 100 keV cm^2, cooling become
impossible within them, regardless of changes in density. On quasar scales,
this has the effect of inhibiting further formation, resulting in the observed
fall-off in their number densities below z = 2. On galaxy scales, quasar
feedback fixes the turn-over scale in the galaxy luminosity function (L_*) as
the nonlinear scale at the redshift of strong feedback. The galaxy luminosity
function then remains largely fixed after this epoch, consistent with recent
observations and in contrast to the strong evolution predicted in more standard
galaxy-formation models. Finally, strong quasar feedback explains why the
intracluster medium is observed to have been pre-heated to entropy levels just
above S_crit, the minimum excess that would not have been erased by cooling.
The presence of such outflows is completely consistent with the observed
properties of the Lyman-alpha forest at z ~ 2, but is expected to have a

form stars and become galaxies. We analyze the dynamical evolution of the
satellite halos in a high-resolution cosmological simulation of MW sized halos

the present masses <10^8-10^9 Msun (circular velocities Vmax<30 km/s) had
considerably larger masses and circular velocities when they formed at
redshifts z>2. After the initial period of mass accretion in isolation, these
objects experience dramatic mass loss due to tidal stripping, in some cases

smallest dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the LG were able to build up a sizable
stellar mass in their seemingly shallow potential wells. We propose a new model
in which all of the luminous dwarf spheroidals in the Local Group are

  Variations are seen in the ranges and average values of age, metallicity and
$\alpha$-element abundance ratios for galaxies in different environments. Age
distributions support the hierarchical formation prediction that field galaxies
are on average younger than their cluster counterparts. However, the ages of
HCG galaxies are shown to be more similar to those of cluster galaxies than
those in the field, contrary to the expectations of current hierarchical
models. A trend for lower velocity dispersion galaxies to be younger was also
seen. This is again inconsistent with hierarchical collapse models, but is
qualitatively consistent with the latest N-body-SPH models based on monolithic
collapse in which star formation continues for many Gyr in low mass halos.

observed between black holes and neutron stars, I discuss on the most likely
accretion geometry and emission processes associated with hard and soft
spectral states. For black holes, in the hard state, the accretion geometry is
more likely made of a truncated disk and a hot inner flow, in which thermal
Comptonization takes place. The truncated disk is likely to be the dominant
source of seed photons, and the site for the production of the reflection
component observed. In soft states, the disk now extends closer to the compact
object and is brighter in X-rays. The hard X-ray emission occurs through
Comptonization of disk photons on a thermal/non-thermal electron distribution,
generated in magnetic flares above the accretion disk. For neutron stars,
similar accretion geometry and emission mechanisms may apply but the
unavoidable radiation from the neutron star surface adds yet another component
in the X-ray spectrum. It also acts as an additional source of cooling for the
Comptonizing cloud, leading to softer spectra in neutron stars than in black
holes.

while longer ones will induce the condensation of the ambient medium. At fixed

1/P. It scales as f^(1/2), where f is the factor by which the magnetic field
depresses the thermal conductivity below Spitzer's benchmark value. For
plausible values of f, l_crit is similar to the lengths of observed filaments.
In a cluster such as Perseus, the value of l_crit increases by over an order of
magnitude between the centre and a radius of 100 kpc. If the spectrum of seed
filament lengths l is strongly falling with l, as is natural, then these
results explain why filaments are only seen within a few kiloparsecs of the

calculate the differential emission measure as a function of temperature for
the interface between filaments and ambient gas of various temperatures. We

where they eventually sink to the core, annihilate and produce e.g. neutrinos
that can be searched for with neutrino telescopes. The Earth is believed to
capture WIMPs not dominantly from the Milky Way halo directly, but instead from
a distribution of WIMPs that have diffused around in the solar system due to
gravitational interactions with the planets in the solar system. Recently,
doubts have been raised about the lifetime of these WIMP orbits due to solar
capture. We here investigate this issue by detailed numerical simulations.
  Compared to earlier estimates, we find that the WIMP velocity distribution is
significantly suppressed below about 70 km/s which results in a suppression of
the capture rates mainly for heavier WIMPs (above ~100 GeV). At 1 TeV and above
the reduction is almost a factor of 10.
  We apply these results to the case where the WIMP is a supersymmetric
neutralino and find that, within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM), the annihilation rates, and thus the neutrino fluxes, are reduced even
more than the capture rates. At high masses (above ~1 TeV), the suppression is
almost two orders of magnitude.
  This suppression will make the detection of neutrinos from heavy WIMP
annihilations in the Earth much harder compared to earlier estimates.

rise to two additional emission components, one produced inside the GRB blast
wave and one associated with an escaping beam of ultra-high energy (UHE; >
10^{14} eV) neutrons, gamma rays, and neutrinos. The first component extending
to ~ 100 MeV is from a pair-photon cascade induced by photomeson processes with
the internal synchrotron photons coincident with the prompt radiation. The
outflowing UHE neutral beam can undergo further interactions with external
photons from the backscattered photon field to produce a beam of
hyper-relativistic electrons that lose most of their energy during a fraction

measured masses and 5 GHz and 2-10 keV core luminosities, together with a few
galactic black holes simultaneously observed in the radio and X-ray bands,
Merloni, Heinz, & Di Matteo (2003) showed that the sources are correlated
through a ``fundamental plane'' relationship in the three-dimensional (log L_R,
log L_X, log M) space. Here I elaborate on how such a relationship can be used
to infer directly mass and accretion rate of any black hole given its radio and
X-ray fluxes, complementing the information obtained from optical/UV surveys.
As an example, I show how the local X-ray and radio luminosity functions,
coupled with the black hole mass function derived from the M-\sigma relation,
provide us with an accretion rate function. It is found that the typical X-ray
Eddington ratio of an active black hole at redshift zero is about 5 \times
10^{-4}.

population of X-ray bright, optically normal galaxies (XBONGs) at moderate
redshifts. We propose that many XBONGs are powered by an inner radiatively
inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) plus an outer radiatively efficient thin
accretion disk. The absence of optical/UV activity in XBONGs is explained by
the truncation of the thin disk near the black hole, while the relatively
strong X-ray emission is explained as inverse Compton emission from the hot
RIAF. As an example, we show that the spectra of two XBONGs can be fit fairly
well with such a model. By comparing these two sources to other accreting black
holes, we argue that XBONGs are intermediate in their characteristics between
distant luminous active galactic nuclei and nearby low-luminosity nuclei.

possible topological states of the system are distinguished using the Gauss
linking number as a topological invariant, the partition function of an
ensemble of N closed polymers coincides with the 2N point function of a field
theory containing a set of N complex replica fields and Abelian Chern-Simons
fields. Thanks to this mapping to field theories, some quantitative predictions
on the behavior of topologically entangled polymers have been obtained by
exploiting perturbative techniques. In order to go beyond perturbation theory,
a connection between polymers and anyons is established here. It is shown in
this way that the topological forces which maintain two polymers in a given
topological configuration have both attractive and repulsive components. When
these opposite components reach a sort of equilibrium, the system finds itself
in a self-dual point similar to that which, in the Landau-Ginzburg model for
superconductors, corresponds to the transition from type I to type II
superconductivity. The significance of self-duality in polymer physics is
illustrated considering the example of the so-called $4-plat$ configurations,
which are of interest in the biochemistry of DNA processes like replication,
transcription and recombination. The case of static vortex solutions of the

arrays of underdamped Josephson junctions placed in a single-mode resonant
cavity. Starting from a well-defined model Hamiltonian, which includes the
effects of driving current and dissipative coupling to a heat bath, we write
down the Heisenberg equations of motion for the variables of the Josephson
junction and the cavity mode. In the limit of many photons, these equations
reduce to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved
numerically. We present a review of some characteristic numerical results,
which show many features similar to experiment. These include self-induced
resonant steps (SIRS's) at voltages $V = n\hbar\Omega/(2e)$, where $\Omega$ is
the cavity frequency, and $n$ is generally an integer; a threshold number $N_c$
of active rows of junctions above which the array is coherent; and a
time-averaged cavity energy which is quadratic in the number of active
junctions, when the array is above threshold. When the array is biased on a
SIRS, then, for given junction parameters, the power radiated into the array
varies as the square of the number of active junctions, consistent with
expectations for coherent radiation. For a given step, a two-dimensional array
radiates much more energy into the cavity than does a one-dimensional array.
Finally, in two dimensions, we find a strong polarization effect: if the cavity
mode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a
square array, then it does not couple to the array and no power is radiated
into the cavity.

applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review
including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model
problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate,
blocking electrodes which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the
electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are
first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and
numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear''
limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions
in the small parameter $\epsilon = \lambda_D/L$, where $\lambda_D$ is the
screening length and $L$ the electrode separation. At leading order, the system
initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of $\lambda_D L / D$
(not $\lambda_D^2/D$), where $D$ is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity
violates this common picture and introduce multiple time scales. The charging
process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the
double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, $L^2/D$. In the
``strongly nonlinear'' regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter
resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration
gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article
concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface
conduction, multi-component electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.

investigate the recent criterion obtained in ref. [20] which should be
fulfilled by any static and spherically symmetric solution in the state of
hydrostatic equilibrium. It is seen that this criterion is fulfilled only by
(i) the regular solutions having a vanishing surface density together with the
pressure, and (ii) the singular solutions corresponding to a non-vanishing
density at the surface of the configuration . On the other hand, the regular
solutions corresponding to a non-vanishing surface density do not fulfill this
criterion. Based upon this investigation, we point out that the exterior
Schwarzschild solution itself provides necessary conditions for the types of
the density distributions to be considered inside the mass, in order to obtain
exact solutions or equations of state compatible with the structure of general
relativity. The regular solutions with finite centre and non-zero surface
densities which do not fulfill the criterion [20], in fact, can not meet the
requirement of the `actual mass' set up by exterior Schwarzschild solution. The
only regular solution which could be possible in this regard is represented by
uniform (homogeneous) density distribution.
  The criterion [20] provides a necessary and sufficient condition for any
static and spherical configuration (including core-envelope models) to be
compatible with the structure of general relativity. Thus, it may find
application to construct the appropriate core-envelope models of stellar
objects like neutron stars and may be used to test various equations of state
for dense nuclear matter and the models of relativistic stellar structures like
star clusters.

comparable sources of uncertainty; the experimental uncertainty from moments of

theoretical uncertainty associated with the renormalization scale. Through
resummation of all logarithmic terms explicitly determined in the perturbative
series by the renormalization-group (RG) equation, it is shown that the
renormalization-scale dependence is virtually eliminated as a source of
theoretical uncertainty in $m_b(m_b)$. This resummation also reduces the
estimated effect of higher-loop perturbative contributions, further reducing
the theoretical uncertainties in $m_b(m_b)$. Furthermore, such resummation
techniques improve the agreement between the values of the MS-bar b-quark mass
extracted from the various moments of $R(s)=\sigma(e^+e^-\to{\rm

choose an optimummoment for determining $m_b(m_b)$. Resummation techniques are
also shown to reduce renormalization-scale dependence in the relation between
b-quark MS-bar and pole mass and in the relation between the pole and $1S$

coincident fuzzy spheres cannot be realized as the true vacuum in this model

zero-modes for toroidal compactifications, too. As an application we calculate
the commutator of the coordinate fields in the case of general constant
Neveu-Schwarz U(1)-field strengths. Thereby we confirm previous results on
non-commutativity of open string theories in Neveu-Schwarz backgrounds. Chapter
5 reviews the results of a former publication [1] on asymmetric orientifolds,
supplemented by some recent insights in connection with chapter 4. Chapter 6
summarizes publication [2] where we investigated to what extend one can build
phenomenologically interesting models from toroidal orientifolds. By turning on
magnetic fluxes on D9-branes we induce chiral fermions. Most calculations are
performed in an (equivalent) T-dual picture. Here the number of chiral fermions
is given by the topological intersection number of D-branes. In orientifolds of
toroidal compactifications one obtains either non-chiral or non-supersymmetric
orientifold solutions. However both properties can be reconciled in
orientifolds that are obtained from specific supersymmetric orbifold
compactifications. In chapter 7 we present the ``sigma Omega'' -Orientifold on
a T^6/Z(4) orbifold. As a very attractive example we investigate a
supersymmetric U(4) x U(2)^3_L x U(2)^3_R model that is broken to an MSSM-like

different sectors of a single theory. For instance, U(1) theory possesses a
sequence of vacua labeled by an integer parameter N, and the theory in the

theory. We construct domain walls on noncommutative plane, which separate vacua
with different gauge groups in gauge theory with adjoint scalar field. The
scalar field has nonminimal coupling to the gauge field, such that the scale of
noncommutativity is determined by the vacuum value of the scalar field. The
domain walls are solutions of the BPS equations in the theory. It is natural to
interprete the domain wall as a stack of D-branes plus a stack of folded
D-branes. We support this interpretation by the analysis of small fluctuations
around domain walls, and suggest that such configurations of branes emerge as
solutions of the Matrix model in large class of pp-wave backgrounds with
inhomogeneous field strength. We point out that the folded D-brane per se
provides an explicit realization of the ""mirror world"" idea, and speculate on
some phenomenological consequences of this scenario.

$Cl(r,s)$ on $R^{2N}$ are obtained from representations on $R^N$ by adding two
new generators while in passing from a representation of $Cl(p,0)$ on $R^N$ to
a representation of $Cl(r,0)$ on $R^{2N}$ the number of generators that can be
added is either 1, 2 or 4, according as the Clifford algebra represented on
$R^N$ is of real, complex or quaternionic type. We have expressed canonical
forms of these representations in terms of the complex and quaternionic
structures in the half dimension and we obtained algorithms for transforming
any given representation of $Cl(r,s)$ to a canonical form. Our algorithm for
the transformation of the representations of $Cl(8d+c,0)$, $c\le 7$ to
canonical forms is based on finding an abelian subalgebra of $Cl(8d+c,0)$ and
its invariant subspace. Computer programs for determining explicitly the change
of basis matrix for the transformation to canonical forms are given for lower
dimensions. The construction of the change of basis matrices uniquely up to the
commutant provides a constructive proof of the uniqueness properties of the
representations and may have applications in computer graphics and robotics.

non-relativistic scattering from a spherical well. The conditions for the
existence of resonances are established in terms of time-delays. Resonances are
shown to exist for p-waves (and higher angular momenta) but not for s-waves.
These resonances occur when the potential is not quite strong enough to support
a bound p-wave of zero energy. We then examine relativistic scattering by
spherical wells and barriers in the Dirac equation. In contrast to the
non-relativistic situation, s-waves are now seen to possess resonances in
scattering from both wells and barriers. When s-wave resonances occur for
scattering from a well, the potential is not quite strong enough to support a
zero momentum s-wave solution at E = m. Resonances resulting from scattering
from a barrier can be explained in terms of the `crossing' theorem linking
s-wave scattering from barriers to p-wave scattering from wells. A numerical
procedure to extract phase shifts for general short range potentials is
introduced and illustrated by considering relativistic scattering from a
Gaussian potential well and barrier.

value of $p$ for which the expected cluster size of a fixed vertex attains the
value $\lambda V^{1/3}$, where $\lambda$ is fixed and positive. We show that
for any such model, there is a phase transition at $p_c$ analogous to the phase
transition for the random graph, provided that a quantity called the triangle
diagram is sufficiently small at the threshold $p_c$. In particular, we show
that the largest cluster inside a scaling window of size
$|p-p_c|=\Theta(\cn^{-1}V^{-1/3})$ is of size $\Theta(V^{2/3})$, while below
this scaling window, it is much smaller, of order
$O(\epsilon^{-2}\log(V\epsilon^3))$, with $\epsilon=\cn(p_c-p)$. We also obtain
an upper bound $O(\cn(p-p_c)V)$ for the expected size of the largest cluster

contains an independent chloride ion pathway. ClC channel gating is regulated
by chloride ion concentration, pH, and voltage. Based on structural and
physiological evidence, it has been proposed that a glutamate residue on the
extracellular end of the selectivity filter acts as a fast gate. We utilize a
new search algorithm which incorporates electrostatic information to explore
the ion transit pathways through wild-type and mutant bacterial ClC channels.
Examination of the chloride ion permeation pathways supports the proposed
important role of the glutamate residue in gating. An external chloride binding
site previously postulated in physiological experiments is located near a
conserved basic residue adjacent to the gate. In addition, access pathways are
found for proton migration to the gate, enabling pH control at hyperpolarized
membrane potentials. A chloride ion in the selectivity filter is required for
the pH-dependent gating mechanism.

This speed-up comes in addition to the speed-up due to a multiexponential

The speed-up, however, is independent of the multiexponential approximation and
reduces time from O(N3) to O(N2) in the exact case. In addition to calculating
the standard base-pairing probability profiles, we propose to use the algorithm
to calculate various other probabilities (loops, helices, tails) for a more
direct view of the melting regions and their positions and sizes.

of the phenomenon of wave packet revivals in quantum systems has flourished
over the last decade and a half. Quantum revivals are characterized by
initially localized quantum states which have a short-term, quasi-classical
time evolution, which then can spread significantly over several orbits, only
to reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading
reverses itself, the wave packet relocalizes, and the semi-classical
periodicity is once again evident. Relocalization of the initial wave packet
into a number of smaller copies of the initial packet (`minipackets' or
`clones') is also possible, giving rise to fractional revivals. Systems
exhibiting such behavior are a fundamental realization of time-dependent
interference phenomena for bound states with quantized energies in quantum
mechanics and are therefore of wide interest in the physics and chemistry
communities.
  We review the theoretical machinery of quantum wave packet construction
leading to the existence of revivals and fractional revivals, in systems with
one (or more) quantum number(s), as well as discussing how information on the
classical period and revival time is encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum.
We discuss a number of one-dimensional model systems which exhibit revival
behavior, including the infinite well, the quantum bouncer, and others, as well
as several two-dimensional integrable quantum billiard systems. Finally, we
briefly review the experimental evidence for wave packet revivals in atomic,
molecular, and other systems, and related revival phenomena in condensed matter
and optical systems.
