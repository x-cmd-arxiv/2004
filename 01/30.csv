that of the Milky Way's globular clusters; their metallicity distribution is
somewhat more metal-rich, but this may be the result of our color selection of
candidates. The mean [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio in the clusters is $-0.2\pm0.3$, which
is lower than the Milky Way average. The specific frequencies $S_N$ are similar
to those of other late-type galaxies. However, if we calculate the specific

fireball plasmas are two of the most important open questions in all GRB
models. We show that the structure and strength of the magnetic field may be
constrained by radio and IR observations of the early afterglow, where plasma
effects on the polarization of propagating radiation are significant. We
calculate these propagation effects for cold and relativistic plasmas, and find
that in the presence of a uniform equipartition field the degree of linear
polarization is suppressed, and circular polarization prevails at low
frequencies, nu < 1-3 GHz, (2x10^11 Hz < nu < few x 10^14 Hz) in the forward
(reverse) shock. At higher frequencies linear polarization dominates. At the
frequency of the transition between circular and linear polarization, the net
level of polarization is minimal, ~10-20%. These features are nearly
independent of the circumburst density. The transition frequency is smaller by
a factor of ~10 when the uniform field is much weaker than equipartition. The
dependence of these results on viewing geometry, outflow collimation and
magnetic field orientation is discussed. When the configuration of the field is
entangled over length scales much smaller than the extent of the emitting
plasma, the aforementioned effects should not be observed and a linear
polarization at the few % level is expected. Polarimetric observations during
the early afterglow, and particularly of the reverse shock emission, may
therefore place strong constraints on the structure and strength of the
magnetic field within the fireball plasma.

naturally to stellar halos with masses and density profiles much like the

stellar halos and show that ours is likely dominated by substructure beyond

density profile is expected to drop off with radius more quickly than that of
the dark matter because the stellar halo is formed from the most tightly bound
material in infalling systems, while the majority of the accreted dark matter
is stripped and deposited at larger radii. We argue that stars associated with
the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving
satellites and also different from stars in the outer halo or those liberated
in recent disruption events. We discuss how deep halo surveys and chemical
probes may be useful tools for uncovering evidence of accretion. Searches of

images trace a straight jet extending to 2 arcsec at P.A. -18 degrees. Extended
low brightness emission was detected in the MERLIN observation at 1.6 GHz and
the VLA observation at 8.5 GHz with a bend of about 90 degrees at the end of
the 2 arcsecond jet. A region of similar diffuse emission is also seen about 2
arcseconds south of the radio core. The VLBI images of the blazar reveal a
core-jet structure with an oscillating jet on a milli-arcsecond (mas) scale
which aligns with the arcsecond jet at a distance of several tens of
milli-arcseconds from the core. This probably indicates that the orientation of
the jet structure is close to the line of sight, with the northern jet being
relativistically beamed toward us. In this scenario the diffuse emission to the
north and south is not beamed and appears symmetrical. For the northern jet at
the mas scale, proper motions of 13.7 +/-3.5, 10.6 +/- 2.8, and 11.8 +/- 2.8 c
are measured in three distinct components of the jet (q_0=0.5, H_0=65 km /s

VLBI scales in the region in which the jet bends sharply to the north-west. The
spectral index distribution of the source shows that the strongest compact
component has a flat spectrum, and the extended jet has a steep spectrum. A
helical trajectory along the surface of a cone was proposed based on the
conservation laws for kinetic energy and momentum to explain the observed
phenomena, which is in a good agreement with the observed results on scales of

The calculations are based on the model of Popescu et al. (2000), which
incorporates a dustless stellar bulge, a disk of old stars with associated
diffuse dust, a thin disk of young stars with associated diffuse dust, and a
clumpy dust component associated with star-forming regions in the thin disk.
The attenuations, which incorporate the effects of multiple anisotropic
scattering, are derived separately for each stellar component, and presented in
the form of easily accessible polynomial fits as a function of inclination, for
a grid in optical depth and wavelength. The wavelength range considered is
between 912 AA and 2.2 micron, sampled such that attenuation can be
conveniently calculated both for the standard optical bands and for the bands
covered by GALEX. The attenuation characteristics of the individual stellar
components show marked differences between each other. A general formula is
given for the calculation of composite attenuation, valid for any combination
of the bulge-to-disk ratio and amount of clumpiness. As an example, we show how
the optical depth derived from the variation of attenuation with inclination
depends on the bulge-to-disk ratio. Finally, a recipe is given for a
self-consistent determination of the optical depth from the Halpha/Hbeta line

inhomogeneities on the cosmological evolution of the fine structure constant

the observational and theoretical motivations to this work, together with the
standard cosmological model. We start by analysing the phase space of the
system of equations that describes a time-varying fine structure constant, in a
homogeneous and isotropic background universe. We classify all the possible
behaviours of the fine structure constant in ever-expanding universes and find
exact solutions for it. Using a gauge-invariant formalism, we derive and solve
the linearly perturbed Einstein cosmological equations for the BSBM theory. We
calculate the time evolution of inhomogeneous perturbations of the fine
structure constant on small and large scales with respect to the Hubble radius.
We also investigate, in the non-linear regime of the large scale structure
formation, the space-time evolution of the fine structure constant, inside
evolving spherical overdensities. The dependence on the dark-energy equation of
state is also analysed. Finally, we analyse the effects of the coupling of the
field (that drives the variations in the fine structure constant) to the matter
fields, on the space and time evolution of the fine structure constant.

that at these pin concentrations and low temperatures, the thermodynamically
stable state is a topologically ordered Bragg glass. This nearly crystalline
state melts into an interstitial liquid (a liquid in which a small fraction of
vortex lines remain localized at the pinning centers) in two steps, so that the
Bragg glass and the liquid are separated by a narrow phase that we identify
from analysis of its density structure as a polycrystalline Bose glass. Both
the Bragg glass to Bose glass and the Bose glass to interstitial liquid
transitions are first-order. We also find that a local melting temperature
defined using a criterion based on the degree of localization of the vortex
lines exhibits spatial variations similar to those observed in recent
experiments.

depends sensitively on the geometry of its environment, and can affect its
conduction significantly by influencing its energy levels and wave functions.
We illustrate some of the issues involved by evaluating the potential profiles
for a conducting gold wire and an aromatic phenyl dithiol molecule in various
geometries. The potential profile is obtained by solving Poisson's equation
with boundary conditions set by the contact electrochemical potentials and
coupling the result self-consistently with a nonequilibrium Green's function
(NEGF) formulation of transport. The overall shape of the potential profile
(ramp vs. flat) depends on the feasibility of transverse screening of electric
fields. Accordingly, the screening is better for a thick wire, a multiwalled
nanotube or a close-packed self-assembled monolayer (SAM), in comparison to a
thin wire, a single-walled nanotube or an isolated molecular conductor. The
electrostatic potential further governs the alignment or misalignment of
intramolecular levels, which can strongly influence the molecular I-V
characteristic. An external gate voltage can modify the overall potential
profile, changing the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic from a resonant
conducting to a saturating one. The degree of saturation and gate modulation
depends on the metal-induced-gap states (MIGS) and on the electrostatic gate
control parameter set by the ratio of the gate oxide thickness to the channel
length.

while the second path is modeled through a potential scattering-like term. To
study the effects of potential scattering, we employ a modified version of the
Anderson model. Such a model can be exactly solved through the Bethe ansatz,
thus allowing a comprehensive and exact analysis of the zero temperature linear
response conductance. We find transport properties to be extremely sensitive to
the introduction of a potential scattering term. Indeed the presence of such a
scattering term, inter alia, induces a series of first order quantum phase
transitions. Focusing on the Kondo regime of the quantum dot, the
non-perturbative effect of potential-like scattering can be directly tied to
both the breaking of particle-hole symmetry and the interlinking of charge and
spin degrees of freedom in the Anderson model. The sensitivity to potential
scattering is also reflected in a set of complementary exact diagonalization
computations. The consequences of this analysis extends to observations in

ferromagnetic metallic and charge-ordered antiferromagnetic insulating states.
Previous investigations (Burgy {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 277202

transition between those competing states, and induce nanoscale inhomogeneities
that produce the colossal magnetoresistance effect. Recent studies (Motome {\it
et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 167204 (2003)) have provided further
evidence that disorder is important in the manganite context, unveiling an
unexpected insulator-to-metal transition triggered by disorder in a one-orbital
model with cooperative phonons. In this paper, a qualitative explanation for
this effect is presented. It is argued that the transition occurs for disorder
in the form of local random energies. Acting over an insulating states made out
of a checkerboard arrangement of charge, with ``effective'' site energies
positive and negative, this form of disorder can produce lattice sites with an
effective energy near zero, favorable for the transport of charge. This
explanation is based on Monte Carlo simulations and the study of simplified toy
models, measuring the density-of-states, cluster conductances using the
Landauer formalism, and other observables. The applicability of these ideas to
real manganites is discussed.

to strong intraatomic Coulomb repulsion. A symptom of the localization is
antiferromagnetism, where the spins of localized electrons alternate between up

insulating state, and it coexists with antiferromagnetic fluctuations. In one
approach to the coexistence, the holes are believed to self-organize into
'stripes' that alternate with antiferromagnetic (insulating) regions within
copper-oxide planes. Such an unusual electronic state would necessitate an
unconventional mechanism of superconductivity. There is an apparent problem
with this picture, however: measurements of magnetic excitations in
superconducting YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) near optimum doping are incompatible with the
naive expectations for a material with stripes. Here we report neutron
scattering measurements on stripe-ordered La(1.875)Ba(0.125)CuO(4). We show
that the measured excitations are, surprisingly, quite similar to those in
YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) (i.e., the predicted spectrum of magnetic excitations is
wrong). We find instead that the observed spectrum can be understood within a
stripe model by taking account of quantum excitations. Our results support the
concept that stripe correlations are essential to high-transition-temperature

particle, and the transverse momentum flux are studied for the power law
potential $v(r)=\epsilon (\sigma /r)^{\nu}$ (soft spheres). The latter two
correlation functions characterize the Green-Kubo expressions for the
self-diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity. The short time dynamics is
calculated exactly as a function of $\nu $. The dynamics is characterized by a
universal scaling function $S(\tau)$, where $\tau =t/\tau_{\nu}$ and $ \tau
_{\nu}$ is the mean time to traverse the core of the potential divided by $\nu
$. In the limit of asymptotically large $\nu $ this scaling function leads to
delta function in time contributions in the correlation functions for the force
and momentum flux. It is shown that this singular limit agrees with the special
Green-Kubo representation for hard sphere transport coefficients. The domain of
the scaling law is investigated by comparison with recent results from
molecular dynamics simulation for this potential.

increase was attributed to low anisotropy and high permeability that resulted
in favorable magneto-mechanical coupling in the composites. We analyzed the

terms. These new supersymmetric sources of lepton flavour violation may both
enhance the rates of charged lepton flavour violating processes, l_a -> l_b y,
and generate distinct final states, like l_b l_a + jets + missing E_T, at
future colliders. First, we discuss the sensitivity of future e^+e^- colliders
to the SLFV independently of the lepton flavour violating mechanism. Second, we
study lepton flavour violating slepton pair production and decay at a future
e^+e^- linear collider in the context of the seesaw mechanism in mSUGRA
post-LEP benchmark scenarios. We investigate the correlations of these signals
with the corresponding lepton flavour violating rare decays l_a -> l_b y, and
show that these correlations are particularly suited for probing the origin of
lepton flavour violation.

The gap function, the condensation energy and the structure of Cooper pairs are

at low densities, the gap, critical temperature and their ratio deviate from
the weak coupling values. It is shown that the internal structure of Cooper
pairs are robust against the thermal effects, despite the fact that the pairs
are strongly correlated near the critical temperature. Also, the effect of the
strange quark mass, Ms on the phase diagram is examined using a simple

to proper classes of maps (as opposed to sets of maps in Quillen's small object
argument). The necessity of such a generalization arose with appearance of
several important examples of model categories which were proven to be
non-cofibrantly generated. Our current approach allows for construction of
functorial factorizations and localizations in the equivariant model structures
on diagrams of spaces and diagrams of chain complexes. We also formulate a
non-functorial version of the argument, which applies in two different model
structures on the category of pro-spaces.
  The examples above suggest a natural extension of the framework of
cofibrantly generated model categories. We introduce the concept of a
class-cofibrantly generated model category, which is a model category generated
by classes of cofibrations and trivial cofibrations satisfying some reasonable
assumptions.

described as a soliton of an effective chiral theory. The results for the
central NN force show a strong repulsive core at short internucleon distances
supplemented by a moderate attraction beyond 1 fm. The long-range tail of the
central NN potential is driven by the the pion-nucleon sigma term and
consistent with the effective $\sigma$ meson exchange. The spin-orbit part of
the NN potential is repulsive. The large-N(C) scaling behavior of the
scalar-isoscalar NN interaction is addressed. We show that the spin-orbit part
is O(1/N^2(C)) in strength relative to the central force resulting in the ratio
$\simeq 1/9$ suggested by the 1/N(C) expansion for N(C)=3. The latter is in

Signatures can enhance understanding about biological mechanisms and have

tightly coexpressed genes. Results: After suggesting an operational definition
of signature, we develop a method that fulfills these requirements, returning
sets of tightly coexpressed genes with good predictive performance. This method
can also identify when the data are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a few,
stable, easily interpretable sets of coexpressed genes. Identification of
molecular signatures in some widely used data sets is questionable under this

orbital angular momentum of the photons. The reconstruction of the qutrit is
performed with tomographic techniques and a Maximum-Likelihood estimation
method. In this way we also demonstrate that we can perform any transformation

the phase space of dynamical systems is penetrated by the orbits of their
dynamics. We consider interacting qubit systems with dynamics according to
4-local Hamiltonians and continuous quantum random walks. For these systems one
could use the von Neumann entropy of the time-average to characterize the
mixing properties of the corresponding orbits, i.e., what portion of the state
space and how uniformly it is filled out by the orbits. We show that the
problem of estimating this entropy is PSPACE-hard.

every observable is available for experimenters. Here, we generalize the theory
to problems in which the experimenter can use only locally accessible
observables. For such problems, we establish a Cram{\'e}r-Rao type inequality
by obtaining an explicit form of the Fisher information as a reciprocal lower
bound for the mean square errors of estimations by locally accessible
observables. Furthermore, we explore various local quantum estimation problems
for composite systems, where non-trivial combinatorics is needed for obtaining
the Fisher information.

Casimir-Polder \cite{caspol} retardation force due to atomic motion and present
a preliminary (unpublished) critique on one recently proposed cavity QED
detection scheme of Unruh effect \cite{Unr76}. These two well-known effects
arise from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum
field under some boundary conditions introduced by a conducting mirror/cavity
or dielectric wall. The Casimir-Polder force is a retardation force on the atom
due to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic
field in the presence of a conducting mirror or dielectric wall. We have
recently provided an improved calculation by treating the mutual influence of
the atom and the (constrained) field in a self-consistent way. For an atom
moving adiabatically, perpendicular to a mirror, our result finds a coherent
retardation correction up to twice the stationary value. Unruh effect refers
loosely to the fact that a uniformly accelerated detector feels hot. Two prior
schemes have been proposed for the detection of `Unruh radiation', based on
charged particles in linear accelerators and storage rings. Here we are
interested in a third scheme proposed recently by Scully {\it et al}
\cite{Scully03} involving the injection of accelerated atoms into a microwave
or optical cavity. We analyze two main factors instrumental to the purported
success in this scheme, the cavity factor and the sudden switch-on factor. We
conclude that the effects engendered from these factors are unrelated to the
Unruh effect.
