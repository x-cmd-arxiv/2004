shown that an analytically solvable toy model with a non-linear
self-interaction potential U(Phi) leads to dark halo models which have the form
of quasi-isothermal spheres. We argue that these fit better the observed
rotation curves of galaxies than the centrally cusped halos of standard cold
dark matter. The scalar field model predicts a proportionality between the
central densities of the dark halos and the inverse of their core radii. We
test this prediction successfully against a set of rotation curves of low

stellar populations. We perform simulations of a cluster with virial mass ~
3.9x 10^14 Msun, to investigate the effect of varying the feedback strength and
the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Although most of the models are able
to produce acceptable amounts of Fe mass, we find that the profiles of the iron
abundance are always steeper than observed. The [O/Fe] ratio is found to be
sub--solar for a Salpeter IMF, with [O/Fe] -0.2 at R >~ 0.1R200, whereas
increasing to super-solar values in central regions, as a result of recent star
formation. Using a top--heavier IMF gives a larger [O/Fe] over the whole
cluster, at variance with observations. On the other hand, the adoption of a
variable IMF, which becomes top-heavier at z>2, provides a roughly solar [O/Fe]
ratio. Our results indicate that our simulations still lack a feedback
mechanism which should quench star formation at low redshift and transport
metals away from the star forming regions.

neutron stars in general relativity. For each EOS we tabulate maximum allowed
masses as a function of the degree of differential rotation. We also determine
effective polytropic indices, and compare the maximum allowed masses with those
for the corresponding polytropes. We consistently find larger mass increases
for the polytropes, but even for the nuclear EOSs we typically find maximum
masses 50% higher than the corresponding values for nonrotating (TOV) stars. We
evaluate our findings for the six observed binary neutron star (pulsar)
systems, including the recently discovered binary pulsar J0737-3039. For each
EOS we determine whether their merger will automatically lead to prompt
collapse to a black hole, or whether the remnant can be supported against
collapse by uniform rotation (possibly as a supramassive star) or differential
rotation (possibly as a hypermassive star). For hypermassive stars, delayed
collapse to a black hole is likely. For the most recent EOSs we survey the
merger remnants can all be supported by rotation against prompt collapse, but
their actual fate will depend on the nonequilibrium dynamics of the coalescence
event. Gravitational wave observations of coalescing binary neutron stars may
be able to distinguish these outcomes -- no, delayed or prompt collapse -- and
thereby constrain possible EOSs.

is X-ray dark. The measured Doppler shifts are slightly smaller than expected,
implying an effective orbital radius of about 10 Rsolar, instead of 11.5 Rsolar
for the Algol B center of mass. This could be caused by a small contribution of
X-ray flux from Algol A (10-15%), possibly through accretion. The more likely
explanation is an asymmetric corona biased toward the system center of mass by
the tidal distortion of the surface of Algol B. Analysis of the strongest lines
indicates excess line broadening of ~150 km/s above that expected from thermal
motion and surface rotation. Possible explanations include turbulence, flows or
explosive events, or rotational broadening from a radially extended corona. We
favor the latter scenario and infer that a significant component of the corona
at temperatures <10^7 K has a scale height of order the stellar radius. This is
supported by the shape of the X-ray lightcurve and the shallow dip at secondary
eclipse. We also examine the O VII intercombination and forbidden lines in a
Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrograph observation and find no change in
their relative line fluxes as the system goes from quadrature to primary
eclipse. Since these lines are strongly affected by UV irradiation from Algol
A, this supports the conjecture that the corona of Algol B at temperatures of

core mass are small. Linewidth is dominated by thermal motions in both cases.
N2H+ maps show that the intensity distribution does not differ much between
cores without stars and those with stars. This is in contrast to the result
previously obtained in H13CO+ toward Taurus molecular cloud cores. Larger
degree of depletion of H13CO+ in starless cores will be one possible
explanation for this difference. We studied the physical state of molecular
cloud cores in terms of ``critical pressure'' for the surface (external)
pressure. There is no systematic difference between starless cores and cores
with stars in this analysis. Both are not far from the critical state for
pressure equilibrium. We suggest that molecular cloud cores in which thermal
support is dominated evolve toward star formation by keeping close to the
critical state. This result is in contrast with that obtained in the
intermediate-mass star forming region OMC-2/3, where molecular cloud cores
evolve by decreasing the critical pressure appreciably. We investigate the
radial distribution of the integrated intensity. Cores with stars are found to
have shallow (-1.8 to -1.6) power-law density profiles.

simulations representative of gas rich galaxies. We show that the deviations of
the X-ray determined beta^{est} and M^{est} from the true values are linked by
a remarkably simple relation; in particular, M is underestimated if beta is
overestimated, and more radially anisotropic orbital distributions than true
are deduced in presence of gas infall velocities of the order of the local
stellar velocity dispersion (as are likely in the central regions of galactic
cooling flows). The results of this analysis are applied to the most thoroughly
investigated bright elliptical, NGC4472. We show that beta^{est} recently
derived from X-rays corresponds to a galaxy that is unstable by radial orbit
instability. Then, assuming as true beta and M the optically derived values, we
show that the differences beta^{est}-beta and M^{est}-M agree with the
predictions found here in the case of lack of hydrostatic equilibrium, which
points to the latter as a possible explanation for the discrepancies

the ionizing power of the AGN is not sufficient to generate the observed

formed from a star cluster complex (= super-cluster). The star-burst which has
led to the formation of this cluster of star clusters was triggered by the
infall and destruction of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy during the early build-up
phase of the Milky Way. While the star clusters in the super-cluster merge on a
few crossing times scale, which is always longer than the individual cluster
formation time-scale, they capture stars from the destroyed dwarf galaxy very
efficiently. This process makes it possible to explain the age-spread, the

consequence of kinetic constraints. Here we show that KCMs can be regarded as
systems whose configuration space is endowed with a simple energy surface but a
complicated geometry. This geometry is determined solely by the kinetic
constraints, and determines the dynamics of the system. It does not affect the
overall distribution of states. Low temperature dynamical slow-down is then a
consequence of the competition between the paths allowed by the geometry of
configuration space, and those leading to energy relaxation. This competition
gives rise to dynamical bottlenecks unrelated to static properties. This view
of the dynamics is distinct from that based on an underlying static rugged
energy landscape. We illustrate our ideas with simple examples.

analyzing the structural properties as a function of the miscibility parameter,
$ \alpha $, we found that at relatively low temperatures the system separates
forming a liquid A-liquid B interface in coexistence with the vapor phase. At
higher temperatures and, $ 0<\alpha\leq 0.5 $, we found a temperature range,
$T^{*}_{w}(\alpha) \leq T^{*} < T^{*}_{cons}(\alpha)$, where the liquid phases
are wet by the vapor phase. Here, $ T^{*}_{w}(\alpha) $ represents the wetting
transition temperature (WTT) and $T^{*}_{cons}(\alpha)$ is the consolute
temperature of the mixture. However, for $ 0.5< \alpha < 1$, no wetting
phenomenon occurs. For the particular value, $ \alpha=0.25 $, we analyzed
quantitatively the $T^{*}$ versus $\rho^{*}$, and $ P^{*} $ versus $ T^{*} $
phase diagrams and found, $ T^{*}_{c}\simeq 1.25 $, and
$T^{*}_{cons}\simeq1.25$. We also studied quantitatively, as a function of
temperature, the surface tension and the adsorption of molecules at the
liquid-liquid interface. It was found that the adsorption shows a jump from a
finite negative value up to minus infinity, when the vapor wets the liquid
phases, suggesting that the wetting transition (WT) is of first order. The
calculated phase diagram together with the wetting phenomenon strongly suggest
the existence of a tricritical point. These results agree well with some

density approximation (LDA) near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The
LDA fails to describe the critical fluctuations in this regime. This provides a
fingerprint of a materials near ferromagnetic quantum critical points:
overestimation of the tendency to magnetism in the local density approximation.
This is in contrast to the typical, but not universal, tendency of the LDA to
underestimate the tendency to magnetism in strongly Hubbard correlated
materials. We propose a method for correcting the local density calculations by
including critical spin fluctuations. This is based on (1) Landau expansion for
the free energy, evaluated within the LDA, (2) lowest order expansion of the
RPA susceptibility in LDA and (3) extraction of the amplitude of the relevant
(critical) fluctuations by applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to the
difference between a quantum-critical system and a reference system removed
from the quantum critical point. We illustrate some of the aspects of this by
the cases of Ni3Al and Ni3Ga, which are very similar metals on opposite sides
of a ferromagnetic quantum critical point. LDA calculations predict that Ni3Ga
is the more magnetic system, but we find that due to differences in the band
structure, fluctuation effects are larger in Ni3Ga, explaining the fact that
experimentally it is the less magnetic of the two materials.

  (2004)",,,,"cond-mat.soft",,"  We introduce a generalized non-uniform mean-field formalism to describe the
dissociation of weak rod-like polyelectrolytes (PEs). Our approach allows for
two-sublattice symmetry breaking which in titration curves is associated with a
plateau for intermediate dissociation degrees. We first test our method in the
case of a single weak PE by comparison with exact enumeration studies and show
that it gives quantitatively accurate results for the dissociation degree in
the full range of pH values, and in specific performs much better than the
nearest-neighbor approximation (where exact solutions are possible). We then
study charge regulation of the coupled system of a weak polyacid and a weak
polybase as a function of their mutual distance, which has some relevance for
PE-multilayer formation and for PE complexation. An intricate interplay of the
degree of dissociation and the effective interaction between the PEs as a
function of their mutual distance is found.

to work sources, the maximum work that it may yield is governed by its energy
and entropy. For finite systems this bound is usually not reachable. The
maximum extractable work compatible with quantum mechanics (``ergotropy'') is
derived and expressed in terms of the density matrix and the Hamiltonian. It is
related to the property of majorization: more major states can provide more
work. Scenarios of work extraction that contrast the thermodynamic intuition
are discussed, e.g. a state with larger entropy than another may produce more
work, while correlations may increase or reduce the ergotropy.

liquids by considering unsteady shear flows driven by wall oscillations in

atomistic level by molecular dynamics, while the outer region (C), described by
a continuum equation for the transversal momentum, is solved via a finite
volume method. Both regions overlap in the ``handshaking'' region where a
two-way coupling scheme (C$\to$P and P$\to$C) is implemented. A protocol for
the C$\to$P coupling was presented in a previous paper [Delgado-Buscalioni and
Coveney, Phys. Rev. E, {\bf 67}, 046704 (2003)]; here we focus on the the
P$\to$C counterpart, that is, on the exchange of information from the
microscopic to the continuum domain. We first show how to use the finite volume
formalism to balance the momentum and mass fluxes across the P$\to$C surface in
such a way that the continuity of velocity is ensured. Then we analyse the
effect of the fluctuations of the (P) stress tensor on the stability and
accuracy of the numerical scheme. This analysis yields a condition which
establishes a restriction on the resolution of the flow field that can be
described by the hybrid method, in terms of the maximum frequency and
wavenumber of the flow.

repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) loaded into an optical lattice (OL),
which is combined with an external parabolic potential. First, we demonstrate
analytically that, in the repulsive BEC, where the soliton is of the gap type,
its effective mass is \emph{negative}. This gives rise to a prediction for the
experiment: such a soliton cannot be not held by the usual parabolic trap, but
it can be captured (performing harmonic oscillations) by an anti-trapping
inverted parabolic potential. We also study the motion of the soliton a in long
system, concluding that, in the cases of both the positive and negative mass,
it moves freely, provided that its amplitude is below a certain critical value;
above it, the soliton's velocity decreases due to the interaction with the OL.
At a late stage, the damped motion becomes chaotic. We also investigate the
evolution of a two-soliton pulse in the attractive model. The pulse generates a
persistent breather, if its amplitude is not too large; otherwise, fusion into
a single fundamental soliton takes place. Collisions between two solitons
captured in the parabolic trap or anti-trap are considered too. Depending on
their amplitudes and phase difference, the solitons either perform stable
oscillations, colliding indefinitely many times, or merge into a single
soliton. Effects reported in this work for BECs can also be formulated for
optical solitons in nonlinear photonic crystals. In particular, the capture of
the negative-mass soliton in the anti-trap implies that a bright optical
soliton in a self-defocusing medium with a periodic structure of the refractive
index may be stable in an anti-waveguide.

more efficiently when the stability requirement was relaxed. Proteins with both
high stability and high function evolved more efficiently when the stability
requirement was gradually increased than when there was constant selection for
high stability. These results show that in our model, the evolution of function
is enhanced by allowing proteins to explore sequences corresponding to
marginally stable structures, and that it is easier to improve stability while
maintaining high function than to improve function while maintaining high
stability. Our model also demonstrates that even in the absence of a
fundamental biophysical tradeoff between stability and function, the speed with
which function can evolve is limited by the stability requirement imposed on

response to central signals of NM release. Even though NM receptor regulation
is implicated in the pharmacological action of many drugs, and is also known to
be influenced by various environmental factors, its functional consequences and
modes of action are not well understood. In this paper we summarize relevant
experimental evidence on NM receptor regulation (specifically dopamine D1 and
D2 receptors) in order to explore its significance for neural and synaptic
plasticity. We identify the relevant components of NM receptor regulation
(receptor phosphorylation, receptor trafficking and sensitization of
second-messenger pathways) gained from studies on cultured cells. Key
principles in the regulation and control of short-term plasticity
(sensitization) are identified, and a model is presented which employs direct
and indirect feedback regulation of receptor efficacy. We also discuss
long-term plasticity which involves shifts in receptor sensitivity and loss of
responsivity to NM signals. Finally, we discuss the implications of NM receptor
regulation for models of brain plasticity and memorization. We emphasize that a
realistic model of brain plasticity will have to go beyond Hebbian models of
long-term potentiation and depression. Plasticity in the distribution and
efficacy of NM receptors may provide another important source of functional
plasticity with implications for learning and memory.

The patterns at the cell-cell contact zone are composed of two types of
domains, which either contain short TCR/MHCp receptor-ligand complexes or the
longer LFA-1/ICAM-1 complexes. The final pattern consists of a central TCR/MHCp
domain surrounded by a ring-shaped LFA-1/ICAM-1 domain, while the
characteristic pattern formed at intermediate times is inverted with TCR/MHCp
complexes at the periphery of the contact zone and LFA-1/ICAM-1 complexes in
the center. In this article, we present a statistical-mechanical model of cell
adhesion and propose a novel mechanism for the T cell pattern formation. Our
mechanism for the formation of the intermediate inverted pattern is based (i)
on the initial nucleation of numerous TCR/MHCp microdomains, and (ii) on the
diffusion of free receptors and ligands into the contact zone. Due to this
inward diffusion, TCR/MHCp microdomains at the rim of the contact zone grow
faster and form an intermediate peripheral ring for sufficiently large TCR/MHCp
concentrations. In agreement with experiments, we find that the formation of
the final pattern with a central TCR/MHCp domain requires active cytoskeletal
transport processes. Without active transport, the intermediate inverted
pattern seems to be metastable in our model, which might explain patterns
observed during natural killer (NK) cell adhesion. At smaller TCR/MHCp complex
concentrations, we observe a different regime of pattern formation with
intermediate multifocal TCR/MHCp patterns which resemble experimental patterns
found during thymozyte adhesion.

consider a simple system: A classically driven (at Rabi frequency $\Omega$)

frequency equal to the frequency of the atom, $\omega_0$, and the two side
bands have frequencies $\omega_0\pm\Omega$. In the large $\Omega$ limit we

with a Markovian (broad band) bath. This is expected as in the Markovian limit
the fluorescence spectrum for a strongly driven two level atom takes the form
of a Mollow triplet. However the length of time for which the Markovian-like
behaviour persists depends upon {\em which} jump-like unraveling is used.

phase-sensitive channels, i.e. noisy channels with squeezed fluctuations. We
find that squeezing the environment always reduces the survival time of
entanglement in comparison to the case of simple dissipation and thermal noise.
We also show that the survival time is further reduced if the squeezing phase
of the fluctuations is different from the twin-beam phase.

construct quantum theories of non-standard models for space, or space-time. The
starting point is the observation that entities of this type can typically be
regarded as objects in a category whose arrows are structure-preserving maps.
This motivates investigating the general problem of quantising a system whose
`configuration space' (or history-theory analogue) is the set of objects
$\Ob\Q$ in a category $\Q$.
  We develop a scheme based on constructing an analogue of the group that is
used in the canonical quantisation of a system whose configuration space is a
manifold $Q\simeq G/H$, where $G$ and $H$ are Lie groups. In particular, we
choose as the analogue of $G$ the monoid of `arrow fields' on $\Q$. Physically,
this means that an arrow between two objects in the category is viewed as an
analogue of momentum. After finding the `category quantisation monoid', we show
how suitable representations can be constructed using a bundle (or, more
precisely, presheaf) of Hilbert spaces over $\Ob\Q$. For the example of a
category of finite sets, we construct an explicit representation structure of
this type.

(PS-QOCT) technique that provides axial optical sectioning with
polarization-sensitive capabilities. The technique provides a means for
determining information about the optical path length between isotropic
reflecting surfaces, the relative magnitude of the reflectance from each
interface, the birefringence of the interstitial material, and the orientation
of the optical axis of the sample. PS-QOCT is immune to sample dispersion and
therefore permits measurements to be made at depths greater than those
accessible via ordinary optical coherence tomography. We also provide a general
Jones matrix theory for analyzing PS-QOCT systems and outline an experimental
procedure for carrying out such measurements.
