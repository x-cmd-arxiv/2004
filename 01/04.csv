investigate the core aspects of the quasar population, including space density
evolution, evolution of the characteristic luminosity, plausible minimum masses
of quasars, the mass function of SMBH and their formation epoch distribution.
Our model suggests that the characteristic luminosity in the quasar luminosity
function arises primarily as a consequence of a characteristic mass scale above
which there is a systematic separation between the black hole and the halo
merging rates. At lower mass scales, black hole merging closely tracks the
merging of dark halos. When combined with a declining efficiency of black hole
formation with redshift, the model can reproduce the quasar luminosity function
over a wide range of redshifts. The observed space density evolution of quasars
is well described by formation rates of SMBH above $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$. The
inferred mass density of SMBH agrees with that found independently from
estimates of the SMBH mass function derived empirically from the quasar
luminosity function.

that it may obey a peculiar renormalization group equation, which at low

Lambda ~ H^2 M_P^2 stemming from physics near the Planck scale. This value lies
in the ballpark of the measurements from CMB and high-z supernovae. A

energy source that powers compact astrophysical systems An important question
concerning the energy extraction mechanism is whether a Kerr black hole can
communicate stresses to a distant load via a surrounding, force-free
magnetosphere, and whether such structures are stable. In this paper we address
this question. We first re-examine the properties of short wavelength
force-free waves, and show that contrary to earlier claims, fast magnetosonic
disturbances do affect the global electric current flowing in the system, even
in flat spacetime; beyond the light cylinder the perturbed charge density is on
the order of the perturbed Goldreich-Julian charge density. This implies that
the fast magnetosonic surface is a causal wind boundary. We then go on to study
the evolution of a force-free system driven by a spinning-up black hole, by
solving the time dependent Maxwell equations near the horizon using
perturbation method. We find that the electromagnetic field, current and charge
density grow exponentially in the linear regime. We conclude that after time
$t=2M\ln(1/2\alpha^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the lapse function, the evolution
will reach an adiabatic stage, whereby the solution is to a good approximation
the static one, with the angular momentum of the hole being the adiabatic
parameter. This implies that black hole magnetospheres are stable. A brief
discussion on the relation between global current closure and causality in
force-free systems is given at the end.

a result of time variation in the Yukawa couplings, quark masses were large at
the time of the electroweak phase transition, then the Kobayashi-Maskawa
mechanism could be the source of the asymmetry. The Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism
provides a plausible framework where the Yukawa couplings could all be of order
one at that time, and settle to their present values before nucleosynthesis.
The problems related to a strong first order electroweak phase transition may

of the background field method. As an example we take the Mirabelli-Peskin
model, which is composed of 5D super Yang-Mills (bulk) and 4D Wess-Zumino
(boundary). Singular interaction terms play an important role of canceling the
divergences coming from the KK-mode sum. Some new regularization of the
momentum integral is proposed. An interesting background configuration of
scalar fields is found. It is a localized solution of the field equation. In
this process of the vacuum search, we present a new treatment of the vacuum
with respect to the extra coordinate. The ""supersymmetric"" effective potential
is obtained at the 1-loop full (w.r.t. the coupling) level. This is the
bulk-boundary generalization of the Coleman-Weinberg's case. Renormalization
group analysis is done where the correct 4d result is reproduced. The Casimir
energy is calculated and is compared with the case of the Kaluza-Klein model.

without introducing extra boundary components. We use chainlet geometry to
create dipole cells and mass cells which accomplish these goals and model

energy levels in the target. The second and third mechanisms, called electronic
stopping, dominate for E>200 eV. At lower energies it is also shown that a
threshold effect is responsible for a quick drop of the energy loss. This

researchers collaborate on a given topic over extended periods of time. The
logging and sharing of knowledge about how analyses are performed or how
results are obtained is important throughout the lifetime of a project. Here is
where virtual data concepts play a major role. The ability to seamlessly log,
exchange and reproduce results and the methods, algorithms and computer
programs used in obtaining them enhances in a qualitative way the level of
collaboration in a group or between groups in larger organizations.
  The CAVES project takes a pragmatic approach in assessing the needs of a
community of scientists by building series of prototypes with increasing
sophistication. In extending the functionality of existing data analysis
packages with virtual data capabilities these prototypes provide an easy and
habitual entry point for researchers to explore virtual data concepts in real
life applications and to provide valuable feedback for refining the system
design. The architecture is modular based on Web, Grid and other services which
can be plugged in as desired. As a proof of principle we build a first system
