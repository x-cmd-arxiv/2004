globular cluster IC4499 is presented. The mean magnitudes have been estimated
using the K-band template light-curves of Jones, Carney and Fulbright (1996).
We derive an independent estimate of the distance and reddening for the cluster
based on the new <Mk>-logP-[Fe/H] relation from Bono et al.(2003) which has a
zero-point in agreement with the canonical LMC distance of (m-M)0 = 18.5. For
an assumed metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.65+-0.1 we find (m-M)0 = 16.47+-0.04+-0.06
(random and systematic errors respectively) and E(B-V)=0.24+-0.03 in good
agreement with the findings of Walker and Nemec (1996) based on optical data.
The distance estimate is very robust to uncertainties in the reddening estimate
but naturally depends directly on the adopted zero-point of the
<Mk>-logP-[Fe/H] relation.

The heteronuclear and homonuclear mid--infrared line ratios (notably [NeIII]
15.6 um / [NeII] 12.8 um) consistently agree with each other and with HeI 1.7
um / Br10; this argues that the mid-infrared line ratios are reliable
diagnostics of spectral hardness. In a sample of 27 starbursts, [NeIII]/[NeII]
ratios are significantly less excited than model predictions for a Salpeter IMF
extending to 100 solar masses. Plausible model alterations strengthen this
conclusion. By contrast, the low-mass and low-metallicity galaxies II Zw 40 and
NGC 5253 show relatively high neon line ratios, compatible with a Salpeter
slope extending to at least 40--60 Msol. One solution for the low neon line
ratios in the high--metallicity starbursts would be that they are deficient in
>40 Msol stars compared to a Salpeter IMF. An alternative explanation, which we
prefer, is that massive stars in high--metallicity starbursts spend much of
their lives embedded within ultra--compact HII regions that prevent the near-

important consequences for starburst modelling and interpretation.

Failure to detect any pulsar enhancement in the largest of them would put
serious constraints on the multiple SN origin for them. Conversely, the

and light travel time delay on pulsar high-energy lightcurves and polarization
characteristics predicted by three models: the two-pole caustic model, the
outer gap model, and the polar cap model. Position angle curves and degree of
polarization are calculated for the models and compared with the optical data
on the Crab pulsar. The relative positions of peaks in gamma-ray and radio
lightcurves are discussed in detail for the models. We find that the two-pole
caustic model can reproduce qualitatively the optical polarization
characteristics of the Crab pulsar - fast swings of the position angle and
minima in polarization degree associated with both peaks. The anticorrelation
between the observed flux and the polarization degree (observed in the optical
band also for B0656+14) naturally results from the caustic nature of the peaks
which are produced in the model due to the superposition of radiation from many
different altitudes, ie. polarized at different angles. The two-pole caustic
model also provides an acceptable interpretation of the main features in the
Crab's radio profile. Neither the outer gap model nor the polar cap model are
able to reproduce the optical polarization data on the Crab. Although the outer
gap model is very successful in reproducing the relative positions of gamma-ray
and radio peaks in pulse profiles, it can reproduce the high-energy lightcurves
only when photon emission from regions very close to the light cylinder is
included.

lithium abundance of the solar neighborhood, as derived from stars for which
astration of lithium is believed to be unimportant, is traced from

This form for the evolution is dependent on the assumption that astration of
lit hium is negligible for the stars defining the relation. An argument is
advanced that this latter assumption may not be entirely correct, and, the
evolution of lithium with [Fe/H] may be flatter than previously supposed. A
sharp Hyades-like Li-dip is not seen among the field stars and appears to be
replaced by a large spread among lithium abundances of stars more massive than
the lower mass limit of the dip. Astration of lithium by stars of masses too
low to participate in the Li-dip is discussed. These stars show little to no
spread in lithium abundance at a given [Fe/H] and mass.

Very little is known about the post-outburst X-ray properties of these
enigmatic sources. In all five cases Chandra detects an X-ray source
positionally coincident with the nucleus of the host galaxy. The spectrum of
the brightest source (IC 3599) appears consistent with a steep power-law
(Gamma~3.6). The other sources have too few counts to extract individual,
well-determined spectra, but their X-ray spectra appear flatter (Gamma~2) on
average. The Chandra fluxes are ~10^2-10^3 fainter than was observed during the
outburst (up to 12 years previously). That all post-outburst X-ray observations
showed similarly low X-ray luminosities is consistent with these sources having
`switched' to a persistent low-luminosity state. Unfortunately the relative
dearth of long-term monitoring and other data mean that the physical mechanism
responsible for this spectacular behaviour is still highly unconstrained.

effects of inflaton on the dynamics of the primordial perturbations. When
taking interactions into account, it is essential to employ a self-consistent
off-equilibrium formalism to study the evolution of the inflationary background
field and its fluctuations with the back-reaction effects. Within the Hartree
factorization scheme, we show that the O(N) model has at least two observable
remains left behind the off-equilibrium processes: the running spectral index
of primordial density perturbations and the correlations between perturbation
modes in phase space. We find that the running of the spectral index is fully
determined by the rate of the energy transfer from the inflationary background
field to its fluctuations via particle creation processes as well as the
dynamics of the background field itself. Furthermore, the amplitude of the
field fluctuations turns out to be scale-dependent due to the off-equilibrium
evolution. As a consequence, the scale-dependence of fluctuations yields a
correlation between the phase space modes of energy density perturbations,
while the one-point function of the fluctuations in each Hartree mode is still
Gaussian. More importantly, the mode-mode correlation of the primordial
perturbations depends upon the dynamics of the self-interaction {\it as well
as} the initial conditions of the inflation. Hence, we propose that the running
spectral index and the correlation between phase-space modes would be two
observable fossils to probe the epoch of inflation, even beyond.

The extracted photons are rather concentrated towards the equator of the
apparent disk, while both polar caps have a relative photon deficit. The
inclination angle of Saturn during the observation was -27 degrees, so that the
northern hemisphere was not visible during the complete observation. In
addition, it was occulted by the ring system. We found a small but significant
photon excess at one edge of the ring system. The light curve shows a small dip
twice at identical phases, but rotational modulation cannot be claimed at a
significant level. Spectral modeling results in a number of statistically, but
not necessarily physically, acceptable models. The X-ray flux level we

relatively high albedo favoring internal processes, but a definitive

generalized gradient approximation of the density functional theory with Perdew
and Wang functionals have been studied at both the spin-polarized level and the
non-spin-polarized level. For the (100) surface at the non-spin-polarized
level, we find that the center position of the (100) surface is the most
favorable site with a chemisorption energy of 2.762 eV and an optimum distance
of the hydrogen adatom to the Pu surface of 1.07 A. For the spin-polarized
(100) surface, the center site is again the preferred site with a chemisorption
energy of 3.467 eV and an optimum hydrogen distance of 1.13 A. For the
non-spin-polarized (111) surface, the center position is also the preferred
site, but with slightly lower chemisorption energy, namely 2.756 eV and a
higher hydrogen distance, 1.40 A, compared to the (100) center site. The center
site is also the preferred site for the spin-polarized (111) surface, with a
chemisorption energy of 3.450 eV and a hydrogen distance of 1.42 A. Also, for
the spin-polarized calculations, the over all net magnetic moments of the (111)
surface changed significantly due to the hydrogen adsorption. The 5f orbitals
are delocalized, especially as one approaches the Fermi level. However, the
degree of localization decreases for spin-polarized calculations. The
coordination numbers have a significant role in the chemical bonding process.
Mulliken charge distribution analysis indicates that the interaction of Pu with
H mainly takes place in the first layer and that the other two layers are only
slightly affected. Work functions, in general, tend to increase due to the
presence of a hydrogen adatom.

diffraction and x-ray induced photoemission to study the evolution of the Ni
film and its interface with the substrate. The growth of a pseudomorphic film
with tetragonally strained face centered symmetry (fct) has been observed by
out-of-plane x-ray diffraction up to a maximum thickness of 10 Ni layers (two
of them intermixed with the substrate), where a new fcc bulk-like phase is
formed. After the formation of the bulk-like Ni domains, we observed the
pseudomorphic fct domains to disappear preserving the number of layers and
their spacing. The phase transition thus proceeds via lateral growth of the
bulk-like phase within the pseudomorphic one, i.e. the bulk-like fcc domains
penetrate down to the substrate when formed. This large depth of the walls
separating the domains of different phases is also indicated by the strong
increase of the intermixing at the substrate-film interface, which starts at
the onset of the transition and continues at even larger thickness. The
bulk-like fcc phase is also slightly strained; its relaxation towards the
orthomorphic lattice structure proceeds slowly with the film thickness, being
not yet completed at the maximum thickness presently studied of 30 Angstrom

physics notions of dynamical trajectories, phase diagram and growth process. It
is argued that, under the action of the Davis--Putnam--Loveland--Logemann
(DPLL) algorithm, 3-SAT instances are turned into 2+p-SAT instances whose
characteristic parameters (ratio alpha of clauses per variable, fraction p of
3-clauses) can be followed during the operation, and define resolution
trajectories. Depending on the location of trajectories in the phase diagram of
the 2+p-SAT model, easy (polynomial) or hard (exponential) resolutions are
generated. Three regimes are identified, depending on the ratio alpha of the
3-SAT instance to be solved. Lower sat phase: for small ratios, DPLL almost
surely finds a solution in a time growing linearly with the number N of
variables. Upper sat phase: for intermediate ratios, instances are almost
surely satisfiable but finding a solution requires exponential time (2 ^ (N
omega) with omega>0) with high probability. Unsat phase: for large ratios,
there is almost always no solution and proofs of refutation are exponential. An
analysis of the growth of the search tree in both upper sat and unsat regimes
is presented, and allows us to estimate omega as a function of alpha. This
analysis is based on an exact relationship between the average size of the
search tree and the powers of the evolution operator encoding the elementary
steps of the search heuristic.

  and Non-Commutative Formulations","19 pages",,,,"gr-qc",,"  This paper is twofold. First of all a complete unified picture of
$n$-dimensional quantum gravity is proposed in the following sense: In spin
foam models of quantum gravity the evaluation of spin networks play a very
important role. These evaluations correspond to amplitudes which contribute in
a state sum model of quantum gravity. In \cite{fk}, the evaluation of spin
networks as integrals over internal spaces was described. This evaluation was
restricted to evaluations of spin networks in $n$-dimensional Euclidean quantum
gravity. Here we propose that a similar method can be considered to include
Lorentzian quantum gravity. We therefore describe the the evaluation of spin
networks in the Lorentzian framework of spin foam models. We also include a
limit of the Euclidean and Lorentzian spin foam models which we call Newtonian.
This Newtonian limit was also considered in \cite{jm}.
  Secondly, we propose an alternative formulation of spin foam models of
quantum gravity with its corresponding evaluation of spin networks. This
alternative formulation is a non-archimedean or $p$-adic spin foam model. The
interest on this description is that it is based on a discrete space-time,
which is the expected situation we might have at the Planck length; this
description might lead us to an alternative regularisation of quantum gravity.
Moreover a non-commutative formulation follows from the non-archimedean one.

transitions in the Minkowski spacetime and find the scaling behavior of domain
sizes. Topological defects are thus determined by the dynamical processes of
nonequilibrium phase transitions. However, the expansion of the universe

domain size. We also discuss the physical implications of nonequilibrium phase

increasing the volume of certain regions in twistor space. We further argue
that in twistor space, it might be possible to give a purely topological
characterization of a lightsheet, at least for suitably simple spacetimes.

vacuum spacetime serves as a vector potential for a test Maxwell field provides
one with an elegant way of describing the behaviour of electromagnetic fields
near a rotating Kerr black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We use a
similar approach to examine the case of a five dimensional rotating black hole
placed in a uniform magnetic field of configuration with bi-azimuthal symmetry,
that is aligned with the angular momenta of the Myers-Perry spacetime. Assuming
that the black hole may also possess a small electric charge we construct the
5-vector potential of the electromagnetic field in the Myers-Perry metric using
its three commuting Killing vector fields. We show that, like its four
dimensional counterparts, the five dimensional Myers-Perry black hole rotating
in a uniform magnetic field produces an inductive potential difference between
the event horizon and an infinitely distant surface. This potential difference
is determined by a superposition of two independent Coulomb fields consistent
with the two angular momenta of the black hole and two nonvanishing components
of the magnetic field. We also show that a weakly charged rotating black hole
in five dimensions possesses two independent magnetic dipole moments specified
in terms of its electric charge, mass, and angular momentum parameters. We
prove that a five dimensional weakly charged Myers-Perry black hole must have
the value of the gyromagnetic ratio g=3.

Przanowski. It is also shown that any quaternionic Kahler metric with $T^2$
isometry is locally isometric to a Calderbank-Pedersen one. The Swann
construction of hyperkahler metrics in eight dimensions is applied to them to
find hyperkahler examples with $U(1)\times U(1)$ isometry. The connection with
the Pedersen-Poon toric hyperkahler metrics is explained and it is shown that
there is a class of solutions of the generalized monopole equation in

equation. This hyperkahler examples are lifted to solutions of the D=11

before, all the description is achieved in terms of a single eigenfunction F.
Some explicit F are found, together with the Toda structure corresponding to
the trajectories of the Killing vectors of the Calderbank-Pedersen bases.

well-known, but here they are derived as a limit N->infty of a simple linear
diffusion equation on (3N-C)-dimensional N-velocity spheres of radius sqrt(N)
(with C=1 or 4 depending on whether the system conserves energy only or energy
and momentum). In this case, a spectral gap separating the zero eigenvalue from
the positive spectrum of the Laplacian remains as N->infty,so that the
exponential approach to equilibrium of the master evolution is passed on to the
limiting Fokker-Planck evolution in R^3. The non-linear Fokker-Planck equation
is known as Landau's equation in the plasma physics literature. Its N-particle
master equation, originally introduced (in the 1950s) by Balescu and Prigogine
(BP), is studied here on the (3N-4)-dimensional N-velocity sphere. It is shown
that the BP master equation represents a superposition of diffusion processes
on certain two-dimensional sub-manifolds of R^{3N} determined by the
conservation laws for two-particle collisions. The initial value problem for
the BP master equation is proved to be well-posed and its solutions are shown
to decay exponentially fast to equilibrium. However, the first non-zero
eigenvalue of the BP operator is shown to vanish in the limit N->infty. This
indicates that the exponentially fast approach to equilibrium may not be passed
from the finite-N master equation on to Landau's nonlinear kinetic equation.

sublaplacian of a defining function, but also as the curvature of a
characteristic curve, and as a quantity in terms of calibration geometry.
  As a differential equation, the p-minimal surface equation is degenerate
(hyperbolic and elliptic). To analyze the singular set, we formulate some {\em
extension} theorems, which describe how the characteristic curves meet the
singular set. This allows us to classify the entire solutions to this equation
and to solve a Bernstein-type problem (for graphs over the $xy$-plane) in the
Heisenberg group $H_1$. In $H_{1}$, identified with the Euclidean space
$R^{3}$, the p-minimal surfaces are classical ruled surfaces with the rulings
generated by Legendrian lines. We also prove a uniqueness theorem for the
Dirichlet problem under a condition on the size of the singular set in two

condition.

this seemingly global problem by means of purely local techniques, namely by
means of families of small analytic discs partially attached to maximally real

disposition of the characteristic foliation with respect to the track on M of a

condition is optimal for universal removability. Numerous figures are included

sphere $S^3$, corresponding to the same eigenvalue $lambda_k = -k (k +2)$, has

introduce a new basis B3, constructed from the reductions to $S^3$ of peculiar
homogeneous harmonic polynomia involving null vectors. We give the
transformation laws between this basis and the usual hyper-spherical harmonics.
Thanks to the quaternionic representations of $S^3$ and SO(4), we are able to
write explicitely the transformation properties of B3, and thus of any
eigenmode, under an arbitrary rotation of SO(4). This offers the possibility to
select those functions of $ V^k$ which remain invariant under a chosen rotation
of SO(4). When the rotation is an holonomy transfor- mation of a spherical
space $S^3/Gamma$, this gives a method to calculates the eigenmodes of
$S^3/Gamma$, which remains an open problem in general. We illustrate our method
by (re-)deriving the eigenmodes of lens and prism space. In a forthcoming
paper, we derive the eigenmodes of dodecahedral pace.

molecular dynamics simulation for a fragmentation of an infinite fcc lattice.
The fragmentation is induced by the initial condition of the model that the
lattice particles have the Hubble-type radial expansion velocities. As time
proceeds, the average density decreases and density fluctuation develops. By
using the box counting method, it is found that the frequency-size plot of the
density follows instantaneously a universal power-law for each Hubble constant
up to the size of a cross-over. This cross-over size corresponds to the maximum
size of fluctuation and is found to obey a dynamical scaling law as a function
of time. This instantaneous generation of a nascent fractal is purely of
dynamical origin and it shows us a new formation mechanism of a fractal
patterns different from the traditional criticality concept.

interaction, which can include also an isospin dependent term. Concerning
Constituent Quark models, we have shown for the first time that the decreasing
of the ratio of the elastic form factors of the proton is due to relativistic
effects using relativistic corrections to the e.m. current and boosts. Now the
elastic nucleon form factors have been recalculated, using a relativistic
version of the hCQM and a relativistic quark current showing a very detailed
reproduction of all the four form factor existing data over the complete range
of 0-4 $GeV^2$. Futhermore, the model has been used for predictions concerning
the electromagnetic transverse and longitudinal transition form factors giving
a good description of the medium $Q^2$ behaviour. We show that the
discrepancies in the reproduction of the helicity amplitudes at low $Q^2$ are
due to pion loops. We have calculated the helicity amplitudes for all the 3 and
4 star resonances opening the possibility of application to the evaluation of
cross sections.

differential equation associated with the ideal lossless string under tension
and it's relationship to two discrete models. These models are finite
differencing in the time domain and digital waveguide models. It is known from
the theory of partial differential operators that in general one has to expect
the string to accumulate displacement as response to impulsive excitations.
Discrete models should be expected to display comparable behavior. As a result
it is shown that impulsive propagations can be interpreted as the difference of
step functions and hence how the impulsive response can be seen as one case of
the general integrating behavior of the string. Impulsive propagations come
about in situations of time-symmetry whereas step-function occur as a result of
time-asymmetry. The difference between the physical stability of the wave
equation, which allows for unbounded growth in displacement, and computational
stability, that requires bounded growth, is derived.
