underwent a remarkable transformation between a hydrogen-rich Type II supernova
and a helium-rich (hydrogen-deficient) Type Ib. The spectral and photometric
peculiarities were explained by models in which the 13-20 solar mass supergiant
had lost almost its entire hydrogen envelope to a close binary companion. The
binary scenario is currently the best fitting model for the production of such

a long history together in the standard cosmology. The general concordance
between the predicted and observed light element abundances provides a direct
probe of the universal baryon density. Recent CMB anisotropy measurements,
particularly the observations performed by the WMAP satellite, examine this
concordance by independently measuring the cosmic baryon density. Key to this
test of concordance is a quantitative understanding of the uncertainties in the
BBN light element abundance predictions. These uncertainties are dominated by
systematic errors in nuclear cross sections. We critically analyze the cross
section data, producing representations that describe this data and its
uncertainties, taking into account the correlations among data, and explicitly
treating the systematic errors between data sets. Using these updated nuclear
inputs, we compute the new BBN abundance predictions, and quantitatively
examine their concordance with observations. Depending on what deuterium
observations are adopted, one gets the following constraints on the baryon
density: OmegaBh^2=0.0229\pm0.0013 or OmegaBh^2 = 0.0216^{+0.0020}_{-0.0021} at
68% confidence, fixing N_{\nu,eff}=3.0. Concerns over systematics in helium and

the ``Gaussian jet''. The polarisation curves for the last two jet types are

demonstrate instead that polarisation curves are a powerful means to solve the

angle at times around the jet break are very different if not opposite. We
conclude that the afterglow polarisation measurements provide clear footprints

used to constrain their star formation histories (SFHs) and to discriminate
between the monolithic and merger paradigms of elliptical galaxy formation. We
investigate the elliptical CMR predicted in the merger paradigm by using a LCDM
hierarchical merger model. We first highlight sections of the literature which
indicate that the traditional use of fixed apertures to derive colours gives a
distorted view of the CMR due to the presence of colour gradients in galaxies.
Fixed aperture observations make the CMR steeper and tighter than it really is.
We then show that the star formation history (SFH) of cluster ellipticals
predicted by the model is quasi-monolithic, with over 95 percent of the total
stellar mass formed before a redshift of 1. The quasi-monolithic SFH produces a
predicted CMR that agrees well at all redshifts with its observed counterpart
once the fixed aperture effect is removed. More importantly, we present
arguments to show that the elliptical-only CMR can be used to constrain the
SFHs of present-day cluster ellipticals only if we believe a priori in the
monolithic collapse model. It is not a meaningful tool for constraining the SFH
in the merger paradigm, because a progressively larger fraction of the
progenitor set of present-day cluster ellipticals is contained in late-type
star forming systems at higher redshift, which cannot be ignored when deriving
the SFHs. Hence, the elliptical-only CMR is not a useful discriminant between
the two competing theories of elliptical galaxy evolution.

formation appears to dominate their bolometric output. A substantial fraction
of bright SCUBA galaxies show evidence for binary AGN activity. Since these
systems appear to be interacting and merging at optical/near-IR wavelengths,
their super-massive black holes will eventually coalesce.

Our results suggest that a mean neutral hydrogen fraction, x(HI) of unity can
be statistically distinguished from x(HI)<0.01, by combining the spectra of
tens of bright (M = -27) quasars. Alternatively, the same distinction can be
achieved using the spectra of several hundred sources that are ~100 times
fainter. Furthermore, if the radius of the Stromgren sphere can be
independently constrained to within ~10 percent, this distinction can be
achieved using a single source. The information derived from such spectra will
help in settling the current debate as to what extent the universe was

radio detections, allowing us to determine the activity type (star-forming vs.
AGN) for the entire sample. We explore the properties of the radio-detected
KISS galaxies in order to gain a better insight into the nature of
radio-emitting galaxies in the local universe (z < 0.1). No dwarf galaxies were
detected, despite the large numbers of low-luminosity galaxies present in KISS,
suggesting that lower mass, lower luminosity objects do not possess strong
galaxian-scale magnetic fields. Due to the selection technique used for KISS,
our radio ELGs represent a quasi-volume-limited sample, which allows us to
develop a clearer picture of the radio galaxy population at low redshift.
Nearly 2/3rds of the KISS radio galaxies are starburst/star-forming galaxies,
which is in stark contrast to the results of flux-limited radio surveys that
are dominated by AGNs and elliptical galaxies (i.e., classic radio galaxies).
While there are many AGNs among the KISS radio galaxies, there are no objects
with large radio powers in our local volume. We derive a radio luminosity
function (RLF) for the KISS ELGs that agrees very well with previous RLFs that
adequately sample the lower-luminosity radio population.

with density modulations in the circumstellar medium (CSM), which seem to recur
with a period near 150 days. One possibility is that these are due to enhanced
mass-loss from thermal pulses in an AGB star progenitor. A more likely scenario
however is that the progenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star, whose stellar wind
collided with that from a massive hot companion on an eccentric 100 day orbit,
leading to a regular build-up of CSM material on the required time and spatial
scales. Recent observations of ""dusty pinwheels"" in Wolf-Rayet binary systems
lend credibility to this model. Since such binary systems are also thought to
provide the necessary conditions for envelope-stripping which would cause the
Wolf-Rayet star to appear as a Type Ib/c supernova event rather than a Type II,
these radio observations of SN 2001ig may provide the key to linking Type Ib/c
SNe to Type IIb events, and even to some types of Gamma-Ray Bursts.

this simplified model, the condition of the stationary accretion flow is found
to impose a nontrivial constraint on the magnetic field configuration. The

the paraboloidal and hyperboloidal type configuration for the poloidal
structure suggested by Blandford in 1976. It is demonstrated explicitly that
the angular velocity of the disk, $\Omega_D$, deviates from the Keplerian
angular velocity. The angular velocity of the rigidly-rotating magnetic
surface, $\Omega_F$, does not have to be the same as the angular velocity of
the disk for the paraboloidal type configuration. But for the hyperboloidal
type configuration, it is found that we can set $\Omega_F = \Omega_D$, which
corresponds to an accretion disk of perfect conductor. We discuss the numerical
solutions of the stream equation for stationary accretion flow in the

and constant turbulence, together with density distributions close to those of
non-singular isothermal spheres. Using these physical conditions and a Monte
Carlo radiative transfer model, we derive abundance profiles for all species
and model the strong chemical differentiation of the core interiors. According
to our models, the NH3 abundance increases toward the core centers by a factor
of several while N2H+ has a constant abundance over most of the cores. In
contrast, both C18O and CS (and isotopomers) are strongly depleted in the core
interiors, most likely due to their freeze out onto grains at densities of a
few 10^4 cm^{-3}. Concerning the kinematics of the dense gas, we find (in
addition to constant turbulence) a pattern of internal motions at the level of
0.1 km s^{-1}. These motions seem correlated with asymmetries in the pattern of
molecular depletion, and we interpret them as residuals of core contraction.
Their distribution and size suggest that core formation occurs in a rather
irregular manner and with a time scale of a Myr. A comparison of our derived
core properties with those predicted by supersonic turbulence models of core

from the direction of the Galactic Center region is due to the production of
cosmic rays by the last few Gamma Ray Bursts in our Galaxy. The basic idea is
that protons get accelerated inside Gamma Ray Bursts, then get ejected as
neutrons, decay and so turn back into protons, meander around the inner Galaxy
for some time, and then interact again, turning back to neutrons to be observed
at our distance from the Galactic Center region, where most star formation is
happening in our Galaxy. We demonstrate that this suggestion leads to a
successful interpretation of the data, within the uncertainties of cosmic ray
transport time scales in the inner Galaxy, and in conjunction with many

and apply it to copolymers with correlated Markovian sequences. According to
our analysis, heteropolymers present three different dense phases depending
upon the temperature, the nature of the monomer interactions, and the sequence
correlations: (i) a liquid phase, (ii) a ``soft glass'' phase, and (iii) a
``frozen glass'' phase. The presence of the new intermediate ``soft glass''
phase is predicted for instance in the case of polyampholytes with sequences
that favor the alternation of monomers.
  Our approach is based on the cavity method, a refined Bethe Peierls
approximation adapted to frustrated systems. It amounts to a mean field
treatment in which the nearest neighbor correlations, which are crucial in the
dense phases of heteropolymers, are handled exactly. This approach is powerful
and versatile, it can be improved systematically and generalized to other
polymeric systems.

of low dimensionality magnetic systems. Intermixing could be drastically
limited at deposition temperatures as low as 140-150 K. The film structural
evolution induced by post-growth annealing presents many interesting aspects
involving activated atomic exchange processes and affecting magnetic
properties. Previous experiments, of He and low energy ion scattering on films
deposited at 150 K, indicated the formation of a segregated Ag layer upon
annealing at 550 K. Higher temperatures led to the embedding of Fe into the Ag
matrix. In those experiments, information on sub-surface layers was attained by
techniques mainly sensitive to the topmost layer. Here, systematic PED
measurements, providing chemical selectivity and structural information for a
depth of several layers, have been accompanied with a few XRD rod scans,
yielding a better sensitivity to the buried interface and to the film long
range order. The results of this paper allow a comparison with recent models
enlightening the dissolution paths of an ultra thin metal film into a different
metal, when both subsurface migration of the deposit and phase separation
between substrate and deposit are favoured. The occurrence of a surfactant-like
stage, in which a single layer of Ag covers the Fe film is demonstrated for
films of 4-6 ML heated at 500-550 K. Evidence of a stage characterized by the
formation of two Ag capping layers is also reported. As the annealing
temperature was increased beyond 700 K, the surface layers closely resembled
the structure of bare Ag(001) with the residual presence of subsurface Fe
aggregates.

the fitness of nearest neighboring ones, as in Bak-Sneppen population fitness
evolution model. The concentration of firms, the averaged fitness, the regional

translation matrices in covariant non-unitary Poincare representations also
introduces new gauge terms in the construction of massless particle fields from
canonical unitary fields. In the usual procedure without spacetime translation
matrices, gauge terms arise from `translations' of the massless little group;
the little group combines spacetime rotations and boosts making a group
isomorphic with the Euclidean group E2, including E2 translations. The usual
remedy is to invoke gauge invariance. But here, the spacetime translation gauge
terms can cancel the little group gauge terms, trading the need for gauge
invariance with the need to specify displacements and to freeze two little
group degrees of freedom that are not wanted anyway. The cancelation process
restricts the helicity to A-B-1 for A-C = -(B-D) = 1/2 and A-B+1 for A-C =
-(B-D) = -1/2. However, the cancelation only works for the little group
standard momentum and specific transformations and, in general, gauge
invariance is still needed to obtain massless particle fields. Expressions for
massless particle fields for each spin type are found.

integer $N=(4k+1)^{4m+1}\prod_{i=1}^\ell ~ q_i^{2\alpha_i}$ to establish that
there do not exist any odd integers with equality between $\sigma(N)$ and 2N.
The existence of distinct prime divisors in the repunits in $\sigma(N)$ follows
from a theorem on the primitive divisors of the Lucas sequences
$U_{2\alpha_i+1}(q_i+1,q_i)$ and $U_{2\alpha_j+1}(q_j+1,q_j)$ with
$q_i,q_j,2\alpha_i+1,2\alpha_j+1$ being odd primes. The occurrence of new prime
divisors in each quotient ${{(4k+1)^{4m+2}-1}\over {4k}}$,
${{q_i^{2\alpha_i+1}-1}\over {q_i-1}}, i=1,...,\ell$ also implies that the
square root of the product of $2(4k+1)$ and the sequence of repunits will not
be rational unless the primes are matched. Although a finite set of solutions
to the rationality condition for the existence of odd perfect numbers is
obtained, it is verified that they all satisfy ${{\sigma(N)}\over N}\ne 2$
because the repunits in the product representing $\sigma(N)$ introduce new
prime divisors. Minimization of the number of prime divisors in $\sigma(N)$
leads to an infinite set of repunits of increasing mangitude or prime equations
with no integer solutions. It is proven then that there exist no odd perfect
numbers.

walls in that space. Unlike finite dimensional Lie algebras, E10 has negative
and zero norm roots, in addition to the positive norm roots. The walls above
are related to physical fluxes that, in turn, are related to positive norm
roots (called real roots) of E10. We propose that zero and negative norm roots,
called imaginary roots, are related to physical branes. Adding `matter' to the
billiard cosmology corresponds to adding potential terms associated to
imaginary roots. The, as yet, mysterious relation between E10 and M-theory on
$T^{10}$ can now be expanded as follows: real roots correspond to fluxes or
instantons, and imaginary roots correspond to particles and branes (in the
cases we checked). Interactions between fluxes and branes and between branes
and branes are classified according to the inner product of the corresponding
roots (again in the cases we checked). We conclude with a discussion of an

stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo and Morris-Lecar models with either having a focus

value we formulate a fit formula and use it to reconstruct theoretically the
spectral power density, which coincides with the numerically obtained spectra.
We underline that the renewal theory is applicable to analysis of
suprathreshold responses even of resonant neurons.

there are two different deformations of classical phase-space: complex Hilbert

we use the calculus over the hyperbolic algebra similar to functional

jump statistics of three atoms. This is done for three-level systems in a V
configuration and in what may be called a D configuration. The transition rates
between the four different intensity periods are calculated in closed form.
Cooperative effects are shown to increase by a factor of 2 compared to two of
either three-level systems. This results in transition rates that are, for
distances of about one wavelength of the strong transition, up to 100% higher
than for independent systems. In addition the double and triple jump rates are
calculated from the transition rates. In this case cooperative effects of up to
170% for distances of about one wavelength and still up to 15% around 10
wavelengths are found. Nevertheless, for the parameters of an experiment with
Hg+ ions the effects are negligible, in agreement with the experimental data.
For three Ba+ ions this seems to indicate that the large cooperative effects
observed experimentally cannot be explained by the dipole-dipole interaction.
