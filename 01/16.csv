selected sources in the Hellas2XMM survey, with faint optical magnitude (R>24)
and high X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. All but one of the sources have been
detected in the Ks band, with bright counterparts (Ks<19) and red colors
(R-K>5), and therefore belong to the ERO population. A detailed analysis of the
surface brightness profiles allows us to classify all of the NIR counterparts.
There are 2 point-like objects, 7 elliptical galaxies and one source with a
disky profile. None of the extended sources shows any evidence for the presence
of a central unresolved object tracing the putative X-ray emitting AGN. Using
both the R-K colors and the morphological information, we have estimated for
all the sources a ``minimum photometric redshift'', ranging between 0.8 and
2.4; the elliptical hosts have zmin=0.9-1.4. We computed the X-ray properties
using these redshifts: most of the sources have NH>10^{22}, with unabsorbed
X-ray luminosities up to 10^{45}erg s^{-1}. These objects therefore belong to
the population of obscured (Type II) quasars and, from a statistical point of
view, they turn out to be a non-negligible fraction (~10%) of the most luminous
AGN. Selecting the high X/O sources for a follow-up study in the NIR is
therefore a powerful technique aimed at studying at high redshift the hosts of
Type II AGN. Overall, our results seem to indicate that the hosts are mostly
elliptical galaxies at z~1, and that these near-IR bright objects would be
among the most massive spheroids at these epochs.

be easily destroyed by UV radiation. Their spatial distribution reasonably
agrees with the aromatic emission mapped in mid-IR wavelength bands. Their
abundances relative to H2 are relatively high and comparable to the ones
derived in dark clouds such as L134N or TMC-1, known as efficient carbon
factories. In particular, we report the first detection of C6H in a PDR. We
have run steady-state PDR models using several gas-phase chemical networks
(UMIST95 and the New Standard Model) and conclude that both networks fail in
reproducing the high abundances of some of these hydrocarbons by an order of
magnitude. The high abundance of hydrocarbons in the PDR may suggest that the
photo-erosion of UV-irradiated large carbonaceous compounds could efficiently
feed the ISM with small carbon clusters or molecules. This new production
mechanism of carbon chains and rings could overcome their destruction by the UV

short-lived in comparison with a host SMS and collapses finally into the MBH.
Just before gravitational collapse of compact subsystem the frequent NS
collisions are accompanied by the generation of numerous ultra-relativistic
fireballs. A combined ram pressure of multiple coexisting fireballs produces a
quasi-stationary rarefied cavity in the central part of SMS. The protons are
accelerated in the fireballs and by relativistic shocks in the cavity. All
secondary particles, produced in collisions, except the high-energy neutrinos
are absorbed in the SMS interiors. An estimated high-energy neutrino signal

An analysis of old and new photometry confirms earlier results that XZ Cygni
exhibits the Blazhko Effect and that its Blazhko period has changed over time.
These changes in the Blazhko period are anticorrelated with observed changes in
the primary period of XZ Cygni. During the first half of the twentieth century,
XZ Cygni had a Blazhko period of approximately 57.4 d. Beginning in 1965, its
primary period underwent a steep decline in several steps. Coincidentally, its
Blazhko period increased to about 58.5 d. In 1979, the primary period suddenly
increased again. After an interval in which the Blazhko Effect was small, the
Blazhko Effect re-established itself, with a period of approximately 57.5 d.
When its Blazhko period is near 57.5 d, XZ Cygni has also shown a tertiary
period of 41.6 d. We confirm that there is evidence for a longer 3540 d period
in photometry obtained during the first half of the twentieth century. XZ Cygni
is compared with three other RR Lyrae stars which also appear to show changing
Blazhko periods. The observed changes in the length of the Blazhko period of XZ
Cygni constrain possible explanations for the Blazhko Effect. In particular,
they argue against any theoretical explanation which requires that the Blazhko
period be exactly equal to or directly proportional to the rotation period of
the star.

3C 84 also the first radio jet to show both signs of circular polarization

indicate that it is unlikely to be purely intrinsic to the emitted synchrotron
radiation. The Faraday conversion process makes a significant and perhaps
dominant contribution to the circular polarization, and the observed spectrum
suggests the conversion process is near saturation. The sign change in the
circular polarization along the jet may result from this saturation or may be
due to a change in magnetic field order after an apparent bend in the jet. From

time-dependent element diffusion. Our treatment of diffusion includes
gravitational settling and chemical and thermal diffusion. OPAL radiative
opacities for arbitrary metallicity and carbon-and oxygen-rich compositions are
employed. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of the diffusion-modeled
double-layered chemical structure. This structure, which is characterized by a
pure helium envelope atop an intermediate remnant shell rich in helium, carbon
and oxygen, is expected for pulsating DB white dwarfs, assuming that they are
descendants of hydrogen-deficient PG1159 post-AGB stars. We find that,
depending on the stellar mass, if DB white dwarf progenitors are formed with a
helium content smaller than \approx 10^-3 M_*, a single-layered configuration
is expected to emerge during the DB pulsation instability strip. We also
explore the consequences of diffusively evolving chemical stratifications on
the adiabatic pulsational properties of our DB white dwarf models. In this
context, we find that the evolving shape of the chemical profile translates
into a distinct behaviour of the theoretical period distribution as compared
with the case in which the shape of the profile is assumed to be fixed during
the evolution across the instability strip. Finally, we extend the scope of the
calculations to the domain of the helium-rich carbon-contaminated DQ white
dwarfs. In particular, we speculate that DQ white dwarfs with low detected
carbon abundances would not be descendants of the PG1159 stars.

multidimensional delayed detonation paradigm in explaining the nature of Type
Ia supernovae coupled with new techniques of observations in the near IR and
with spectropolarimetry promise great advances in understanding binary
progenitors, the explosion physics, and the ever more accurate application to
cosmology. Spectropolarimetry has also revealed the strongly asymmetric nature
of core collapse and given valuable perspectives on the supernova - gamma-ray
burst connection. The capability of the magneto-rotational instability to
rapidly create strong toroidal magnetic fields in the core collapse ambiance is
outlined. This physics may be the precursor to driving MHD jets that play a
role in asymmetric supernovae. Welcome to the brave new world of

B-band light-curve peak that does not conform to current methods for using
shapes of light curves to standardize SN Ia luminosities. We use the
parameterized supernova synthetic-spectrum code SYNOW to study line
identifications in the photospheric-phase spectra of SN 2000cx. Previous work
established the presence of Ca II infrared-triplet features forming above
velocity about 20,000 km/s, much higher than the photospheric velocity of about
10,000 km/s. We find Ti II features forming at the same high velocity.
High-velocity line formation is partly responsible for the photometric
peculiarities of SN 2000cx: for example, B-band flux blocking by Ti II
absorption features that decreases with time causes the B light curve to rise
more rapidly and decline more slowly than it otherwise would.
  SN 2000cx contains an absorption feature near 4530 A that may be H-beta,
forming at the same high velocity. The lack of conspicuous H-alpha and P-alpha
signatures does not necessarily invalidate the H-beta identification if the
high-velocity line formation is confined to a clump that partly covers the
photosphere and the H-alpha and P-alpha source functions are elevated relative
to that of resonance scattering. The H-beta identification is tentative. If it
is correct, the high-velocity matter must have come from a nondegenerate
companion star.

stronger relative to ^{13}CO and C^{18}O away from the nucleus and along the

of >40. We attribute the relative ^{13}CO weakness to a rapid change in the
interstellar medium from dense star forming cores in a central ring to diffuse,
low density molecular gas in and behind the molecular arms. This change is
abrupt, occurring in less than a beamsize (90 pc), about the size of a giant
molecular cloud. Column densities determined from ^{13}CO(1-0), C^{18}O(1-0),

factor, X_{CO}, overestimates the amount of molecular gas in NGC 6946 by
factors of ~3-5 towards the central ring and potentially even more so in the
diffuse gas away from the central starburst. We suggest that the nuclear bar
acts to create coherent regions of molecular clouds with distinct and different
physical conditions. The ^{12}CO(1-0)/^{13}CO(1-0) line ratio in galactic

reveal the presence of a massive (~0.6 M_sun} envelope of molecular gas around
the origin of the remarkable bipolar jet system seen in optical images with the
HST. The CO kinematics are well modeled by an expanding, bi-conical envelope:
the prominent, high-velocity (~50 km/s) wings seen in single-dish CO spectra
arise where the sides of the bi-cones are projected along the line of sight.
The continuum is detected at 1.3 mm and 2.6 mm and is due to thermal emission
from warm (~80 K) circumstellar dust. The structure, kinematics, and expansion
time of the envelope provide strong evidence for entrainment of the molecular
gas by the high velocity jets. The observations support an evolutionary
scenario in which a period of enhanced mass loss by the central star is
followed by the development of the bipolar jets which burst through the
molecular envelope. The jet-envelope interactions play a crucial role in
shaping the subsequent ionized nebula.

radius of Basel 4 and NGC 7067 are about 1.8 and 3.0 arcmin respectively.The
(U-B) versus (B-V) diagrams indicate that metallicity of NGC 7067 is solar

law towards both the clusters.
  Using the intrinsic colour-magnitude diagrams of the cluster members, we
estimated the distances of the clusters as 3.0$\pm$0.2 and 3.6$\pm$0.2 Kpc for
Basel 4 and NGC 7067 respectively. By fitting the proper metallicity isochrones
to the bright cluster members we estimated the age of the clusters as

function slope which is derived by applying the corrections of field star
contamination and data incompleteness are $1.55\pm0.25$ and $1.68\pm0.47$ for
Basel 4 and NGC 7067 respectively. The values of mass function slopes are thus
not too different from the Salpeter's (1955) value. Mass segregation is
observed in both the clusters which may be due to the dynamical evolutions or

describe a simulator created to generate time series of stochastically excited

both white and non-white noise. We also outline a new method to compare a large
number of simulated time series with an observed time series to determine the

bolometric light curves and the edges of the instability strip, showing that a

the winds should be stronger at lower metallicity due to less efficient line

hence reducing their numbers. These winds can also provide extra material near

started to rise by about 1 magnitude in December 1999, followed by a rapid
decline to its previous brightness over the next six months. This behaviour is
similar to that exhibited by this system around its eruption in February 1987.
A comparison of the intrinsic luminosities of the system with recent
evolutionary calculations shows that Z CMa may consist of a 16 M_sun B0 IIIe
primary star and a ~ 3 M_sun FUOr secondary with a common age of ~ 3 x 10^5 yr.
We also compare new high-resolution spectra obtained in Jan. and Feb. 2000,
during the recent rise in brightness, with archive data from 1991 and 1996. The
spectra are rich in emission lines, which originate from the envelope of the
early B-type primary star. The strength of these emission lines increased
strongly with the brightness of Z CMa. We interpret the collected spectral data
in terms of an accretion disc with atmosphere around the Herbig B0e component
of Z CMa, which has expanded during the outbursts of 1987 and 2000. A high
resolution profile of the 6300 A [O I] emission line, obtained by us in March

extending to ~ -700 km/s, which was much fainter in the pre-outburst spectra.

emission from their constituent galaxies, as well as less overdense structures,
such as proto-clusters and the `cosmic web', at higher redshifts. Using
semi-analytic methods we compute the number of virialized objects and those at
turnaround which might be detected by such surveys. We find a surprisingly
large number of objects might be detected even using small (approx. 5%)

studied by comparison with all-electron reference calculations in some binary

either core (frozen core, augmentation spheres) or basis set. This is important
since the validity of such approximations, even in all-electron calculations,
rely on the small core perturbation usual in low-energy studies. The expected

from a one dimensional Mott insulator to a two (or three) dimensional metal.
Such a transition has of course a strong impact on the physical properties of
these compounds, and is directly seen in transport measurements.

introduced (chain-DMFT). Using this method we investigate a system of coupled

result of user's behavior coupled to the network dynamics and it effects should
be minimized by choosing appropriate routing strategies. But what are the
requirements of routing depth in order to optimize the traffic flow? In this
paper we analyse the behavior of Internet traffic with a topologically
realistic spatial structure as described in a previous study (S-H. Yook et al.
,Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, {\bf 99} (2002) 13382). The model involves
self-regulation of packet generation and different levels of routing depth. It
is shown that it reproduces the relevant key, statistical features of
Internet's traffic. Moreover, we also report the existence of a critical path
horizon defining a transition from low-efficient traffic to highly efficient
flow. This transition is actually a direct consequence of the web's small world
architecture exploited by the routing algorithm. Once routing tables reach the
network diameter, the traffic experiences a sudden transition from a
low-efficient to a highly-efficient behavior. It is conjectured that routing
policies might have spontaneously reached such a compromise in a distributed
manner. Internet would thus be operating close to such critical path horizon.

barotropic equation of state. To obtain the value of the anisotropy parameter
at an arbitrary moment an evolution equation is derived, describing the
dynamics of the anisotropy as a function of the volume scale factor of the
Universe. The general solution of this equation can be obtained in an exact
analytical form for the Bianchi I and V types and in a closed form for all

anisotropy in the limit of small times shows that for all Bianchi type
space-times filled with a non-zero pressure cosmological fluid, obeying a
linear barotropic equation of state, the initial singular state on the brane is
isotropic. This result is obtained by assuming that in the limit of small times
the asymptotic behavior of the scale factors is of Kasner-type. For brane
worlds filled with dust, the initial values of the anisotropy coincide in both
brane world and standard four-dimensional general relativistic cosmologies.

questioned. It is observed that the classical spacetime has large curvature
along the transverse collision plane, as signaled by the curvature invariant
(R_ijkl)^2. Thus quantum gravity effects, and in particular higher curvature
corrections to the Einstein gravity, cannot be ignored. To give a specific
example of what may happen, the collision is re-analyzed in the
Einstein-Lanczos-Lovelock gravity theory, which modifies the Einstein-Hilbert
Lagrangian by adding a particular `Gauss-Bonnet' combination of curvature
squared terms. The analysis uses a series of approximations, which reduce the
field equations to a tractable second order nonlinear PDE of the Monge-Ampere
type. It is found that the resulting spacetime is significantly different from
the pure Einstein case in the future of the transverse collision plane. These
considerations cast serious doubts on the geometric cross section estimate,

doesn't exist. One of the main reasons for that is that quantized general
relativity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable. But there are several theories
whose low-energy effective action is general relativity such as super string
theory, supergravity and so on. On the other hand there is the prospect that
quantized general relativity will become consistent nonperturbatively, for
example by way of the $\epsilon$ - expanded analysis in 2 + $\epsilon$ gravity
and the implication of the exact renormalization group equation (ERGE) and so
on. Thus, the reason that we can't check which is right, is because of no
constraint from experiments. By the way, the early Universe can be considered a
good laboratory for QG, because of the high energy scale. In this period it is
thought that the effect of QG governed the Universe. Therefore to construct the
Universe model out of consideration of a certain type of QG can be thought of
the test of the theory. Here the result of quantized general relativity, which
is treated nonperturbatively by ERGE, is checked. The application of QG
improved Einstein equation to the very early Universe shows several
characteristic properties. At first the Universe become free from the initial
singularity. The second is the origin of the cosmological time is uniquely
decided. Furthermore this result doesn't destroy the success that the current

a quotient map w.r.t the conjugacy action exists only on a certain submonoid of
the Kac-Moody group. Non-connected Kac-Moody groups appear naturally as
semidirect product of \C^* with a central extension of loop groups LG, where
the underlying simple group G is no longer simply connected and might even be
non-connected. In contrast to the connected case, the understanding of central
extensions of non-connected loop groups is a rather complicated issue.
Following the approach of V. Toledano Laredo, who dealt with the case of
automorphisms coming from the fundamental group pi_1(G), we classify all of
these central extensions for cyclic component group of LG. Then, we define the
quotient map w.r.t conjugacy action. Furthermore, we construct the
cross-section in every connected component of LG and show that, due the
one-dimensional centre, it carries a natural \C^*-action which does not exist

pressure. If total angular momentum of the excited state is not greater than
that of the ground state, there are large polarization dependences and
variations of shifts with helium pressure that exhibit apparent singularities.
A pressure-variable cell may be a better system for control of this effect than
an atomic beam. A method of avoiding the shifts for the fine structure
measurement is suggested.

"physics/0401075","Tanya Zelevinsky","T. Zelevinsky","Nonlinear Variation of Light-Pressure-Induced Multilevel Atomic Line
  Shifts with Vapor Pressure in Helium Spectroscopy","This paper has been temporarily withdrawn",,,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  This paper has been temporarily withdrawn. Highly nonlinear dependences of
4He 2^3S - 2^3P lines on pressure were observed in vapor cell saturation
spectroscopy. Line shifts agree with those expected from light-pressure-induced
perturbation of atomic velocity distribution. In the lin-perp-lin pump and
probe polarization configuration, multilevel atomic structure must be taken
into account. For a two-level atom, the shift magnitude is determined by the
collisional time constant, but when the system has dark states there is an
additional time constant due to optical pumping. The collisional and optical
time constants compete, and become equal at a certain pressure p_0. Saturation
signal vanishes at p_0 whereas signal due to light pressure remains. This leads
to a dependence of line centers on pressure that exhibits apparently singular
behavior at p_0. The 2S - 2P(J=1) line shift reaches the natural half width.
Vapor cells may be more suitable for investigation of this effect than atomic
beams since the shifts vanish at sufficiently high pressures. Two ways of
controlling the shifts for the helium 2P fine structure measurement are
discussed.

low-loss photonic band-gap fiber by Smith et al. [Nature 424, 657 (2003)]. We
find that surface modes have a significant impact on both the dispersion and
leakage properties of the fundamental mode. Our dispersion results are in
qualitative agreement with the dispersion profile reported recently by Ouzounov
et al. [Science 301, 1702 (2003)] though our results suggest that the observed
long-wavelength anomalous dispersion is due to an avoided crossing (with
surface modes) rather than band-bending caused by the photonic band-gap
boundary of the cladding.

computing. We show that a single specific solution R (the Bell basis change
matrix) of the Yang-Baxter Equation is a universal gate for quantum computing,
in the presence of local unitary transformations. We show that this same R
generates a new non-trivial invariant of braids, knots, and links. Other
solutions of the Yang-Baxter Equation are also shown to be universal for
quantum computation. The paper discusses these results in the context of
comparing quantum and topological points of view. In particular, we discuss
quantum computation of link invariants, the relationship between quantum
entanglement and topological entanglement, teleportation, and the structure of
braiding in a topological quantum field theory.
