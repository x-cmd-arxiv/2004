either via close encounters between two single stars, or during strong
dynamical interactions involving binary stars. Here we study stellar collisions
that occur during binary-single and binary-binary interactions, by performing
numerical scattering experiments. Our results include cross sections, branching
ratios, and sample distributions of parameters for various outcomes. For
interactions of hard binaries containing main-sequence stars, we find that the
normalized cross section for at least one collision to occur (between any two
of the four stars involved) is essentially unity, and that the probability of
collisions involving more than two stars is significant. Hydrodynamic
calculations have shown that the effective radius of a collision product can be
2-30 times larger than the normal main-sequence radius for a star of the same
total mass. We study the effect of this expansion, and find that it increases
the probability of further collisions considerably. We discuss these results in
the context of recent observations of blue stragglers in globular clusters with
masses exceeding twice the main-sequence turnoff mass. We also present Fewbody,
a new, freely available numerical toolkit for simulating small-N gravitational
dynamics that is particularly suited to performing scattering experiments.

A powerful technique for detecting high-redshift galaxies is to search for the
characteristic `Lyman break' feature in the galaxy colour, at wavelengths just
shortwards of Lya, due to absorption of radiation from the galaxy by the
intervening galactic medium. Here we report multicolour imaging of the most

derive a simple expression for the light curve of a source with uniform surface

oblate giant extrasolar planet, and an inclined standard thin accretion disk,
and find the following results. (1) If most stars have rotation periods similar
to chromospherically-active (i.e. spotted) giant stars in the bulge, than ~15%
should be sufficiently oblate (e>0.25) to produce detectable (>1%) deviations
with current observations. The form of the deviation due to ellipticity is
qualitatively similar to that due to limb-darkening. Thus stellar oblateness
may have to be taken into account in interpretations of precise limb-darkening
measurements with microlensing. (2) Giant planets will generally not produce a
detectable oblateness signal, either because they rotate too slowly (if they
are close-in and tidally locked), or because they are too faint (if they are
farther away from the parent star). (3) There is a near-degeneracy between
ellipticity and position angle for equal-area sources with scale-free intensity
profiles and elliptical isophotes. This degeneracy results in a factor of ~2
uncertainty in the measurement of the scale-length of a standard thin accretion

is shown that the compound model of density profiles does not match well with

extends significantly beyond its limb. We argue that the Ly-alpha emission is
likely to be caused by an outflow from the DLA galaxy, presumably powered by
star formation. In the case of negligible dust extinction, the Ly-alpha
luminosity indicates a star-formation rate of 19+/-10 solar masses per year
consistent with that derived from the UV continuum flux from the parent galaxy.

proximity. Numerical simulation allowed to determine the structure of critical

distortions, caused by microlenses for various locations with respect to the
critical curve of a regular lens. The difference of our results from those
obtained earlier with the standard (linearized) approach to describe the

well, such as linear dimension of the emitting region, its location with

that in this case GL acts as a filter, which passes slow temporal variations
without degradations, and smoothes the rapid ones.

occurrence of mass loss fluctuations with timescales of ~100 to ~1000 yrs at
the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase (AGB) is common. We estimate a
lower limit of the occurrence rate of rings in PN haloes to be ~35%.
  Using these new detections and the cases previously known, we discuss the
statistical properties of ring systems in PNe haloes. We estimate that the mass
modulation producing the rings takes place during the last 10 or 20 kyrs of AGB
evolution. In PNe, the spacing between rings ranges from <0.01 pc to 0.06 pc,
significantly larger than those seen in proto-PNe. This, together with the
finding of a possible positive correlation of spacing with the post-AGB age of
the nebulae, suggests that the spacing of the rings increases with time.
  These properties, as well as the modest surface brightness amplitudes of
rings, are consistent with the predictions of the dust-driven wind instability
model explored by Meijerink et al. (2003), but do not immediately exclude other
proposed models.

irregularities and asymmetries, and some possess possible merger remnants or
merging satellites. For these bulges we have introduced the term ""Thick Boxy
Bulges"" (TBBs). About 2% of all disk galaxies (S0-Sd), respectively 4% of all
galaxies with box- and peanut-shaped (b/p) bulges, belong to this class of
galaxies. Using multicolour CCD and NIR data we have enlarged and followed up
our sample of nearly 20 galaxies with a TBB. The disturbed morphology of a
large fraction of these galaxies shows that many of the TBB galaxies are not
dynamically settled. For the TBBs the extent of the box shape seems to be too
large to result from a normal bar potential. Therefore we conclude that two
classes of b/p bulges exist with different origins. While most (~96%) b/p
bulges can be explained by bars alone, the extended boxy structures of TBBs
result most likely from accreted material by infalling satellite companions
(soft merging).

modeled by adding a complex part to the real part of the potential. In such a
case, it is already understood that the complex potential plays a duel role; it
acts as an absorber as well as a reflector due to the mismatch of the phase of
the real and complex parts of the potential. Although this model gives expected
results for weakly absorbing disordered media, it gives unphysical results for
the strong absorption regime where it causes the system to behave like a
perfect reflector. To overcome this issue, we develop a model here using
stochastic absorption for the modeling of absorption by ""fake"", or ""side"",
channels obviating the need for a complex potential. This model of stochastic
absorption eliminates the reflection that is coupled with the absorption in the
complex potential model and absorption is proportional to the magnitude of the
absorbing parameter. Solving the statistics of the reflection coefficient and
its phase for both the models, we argue that stochastic absorption is a
potentially better way of modeling absorbing disordered media.

these relations are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of the classical

quantitative estimate of the fluctuation region size. Away from the fluctuation
region, on the superfluid side, all the data perfectly agree with the
predictions of the quasicondensate mean field theory.--This demonstrates that
the only effect of the leading above-the-mean-field corrections in the

distributions of developed capitalism, including the power-law distribution of

studied in isolation, but this model unifies and connects them within a single

infinite-range ferromagnetic interactions, is studied numerically within the
microcanonical ensemble through a molecular-dynamics approach. Such a model,
known as the classical inertial infinite-range-interaction Heisenberg
ferromagnet, exhibits a second-order phase transition within the standard
canonical-ensemble solution. The present numerical analysis, which is
restricted to an energy density slightly below criticality, compares the
effects of different initial conditions for the orientations of the classical
rotators. By monitoring the time evolution of the kinetic temperature, we
observe that the system may evolve into a metastable state (whose duration
increases linearly with $N$), in both cases of maximal and zero initial
magnetization, before attaining a second plateau at longer times. Since the
kinetic temperatures associated with the second plateau, in the above-mentioned
cases, do not coincide, the system may present a three-plateaux (or even more
complicated) structure for finite $N$. To our knowledge, this has never before
been observed on similar Hamiltonian models, such as the XY version of the
present model. It is also shown that the system is sensitive to the way that
one breaks the symmetry of the paramagnetic state: different nonzero values for
the initial magnetization may lead to sensibly distinct evolutions for the
kinetic temperature, whereas different situations with zero initial
magnetization all lead to the same structure.

anti-phase stripes, the chemical potential is likely to move with doping. For
the hole doped system we find that ``staircase'' stripes which are globally
diagonal but locally vertical or horizontal can reproduce the photoemission
data whereas pure diagonal stripes cannot. We also calculate the magnetic
structure factors of such staircase stripes and find that as the stripe
separation is decreased with increased doping these evolve from diagonal to
vertical separated by a coexistence region. The results suggest that the
transition from horizontal to diagonal stripes seen in neutron scattering on
underdoped LSCO may be a crossover between a regime where the typical length of
straight stripe segments is longer than the inter-stripe spacing to one where
it is shorter and that locally the stripes are always aligned with the Cu-O

magnetic anisotropy occurs ($\chi^{+-} < \chi^{zz}$) due to spin-orbit
coupling. The latter results mainly from different values of the $g$-factor for
the transverse and longitudinal components of the spin susceptibility (i.e. the
matrix elements differ). Most importantly, this anisotropy and the presence of
incommensurate antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic fluctuations have strong
consequences for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. In
particular, reviewing spin fluctuation-induced Cooper-pairing scenario in

cutoff explored in this work. We also compute the meson masses using

reproduced in strong coupling theory in which a bare baryon spin 1/2 octet
interacts with an octet of pseudoscalar mesons. When a suitable mixture of F-
and D-type Yukawa couplings is chosen the dressed baryons group themselves into
an infinite number of SU(3) multiplets of which the ground state turns out to
be a spin 1/2 baryon octet and the first excited state is a spin 3/2 baryon
decuplet. Then follows a spin 1/2 baryon antidecuplet. All states of the

identified with the antidecuplet in the strong coupling spectrum then a
positive parity and a spin 1/2 is predicted for this multiplet.

homogeneous coordinate rings of $X$.
  We first clarify the relations between higher syzygies of very ample line
bundles on $X$ and higher syzygies of Veronese embedding of fibres of $\pi$ by
the same line bundle. More precisely, letting $H = \mathcal{O}_{\P_C
(\mathcal{E})} (1)$ be the tautological line bundle, we prove that if
$(\P^n,\mathcal{O}_{\P^n} (a))$ satisfies Property $N_p$, then $(X,aH+\pi^*B)$
satisfies Property $N_p$ for all $B \in {Pic}C$ having sufficiently large

${rank}(\mathcal{E}) \geq g$ and $\mu^- (\mathcal{E})$ is an integer(Corollary
\ref{cor:Mukai}). Finally for all $n$, we construct an $n$-dimensional ruled

condition of Mukai's conjecture is optimal for every $p \geq 0$.

the skew-symmetric differential forms. At present the theory of skew-symmetric
exterior differential forms that possess invariant properties has been
developed. In the work the readers are introduced to the skew-symmetric
differential forms that were called evolutionary ones because they possess
evolutionary properties. The combined mathematical apparatus of exterior and
evolutionary skew-symmetric differential forms in essence is a new mathematical
language. This apparatus can describe transitions from nonconjugated operators
to conjugated ones. There are no such possibilities in any mathematical
formalism. In the present work it has been shown that the properties of
exterior or evolutionary forms are explicitly or implicitly accounted for in
all mathematical (and physical) formalisms.

First, the Huygens construction of a far field scattering signal is carried out
from a signal obtained at any intermediate plane. Second, a beam function that
describes a finite width beam is introduced, which allows using a theory
developed for an infinite width beam for the relation between a scattering
amplitude and the vorticity structure function. Structure functions of the

the presence or absence of the interdependence property does not determine the
