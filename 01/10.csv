abundances have been computed using the near IR lines of [S III] 9069,9532
along with [S III] temperatures. We find average values, expressed
logarithmically with a standard deviation, of log(S/O)=-1.91(+/-.24),
log(Cl/O)=-3.52(+/-.16), and log(Ar/O)=-2.29(+/-.18), numbers consistent with
previous studies of both planetary nebulae and H II regions. We also find a
strong correlation between [O III] and [S III] temperatures among planetary
nebulae. In analyzing abundances of Ne, S, Cl, and Ar with respect to O, we
find a tight correlation for Ne-O, and loose correlations for Cl-O and Ar-O.
All three trends appear to be colinear with observed correlations for H II
regions. S and O also show a correlation but there is a definite offset from
the behavior exhibited by H II regions and stars. We suggest that this S
anomaly is most easily explained by the existence of S^+3, whose abundance must
be inferred indirectly when only optical spectra are available, in amounts in
excess of what is predicted by model-derived ionization correction factors.
Finally for the disk PNe, abundances of O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar all show gradients
when plotted against galactocentric distance. The slopes are statistically
indistinguishable from one another, a result which is consistent with the
notion that the cosmic abundances of these elements evolve in lockstep.

However,the degree of field regularity is rather low, implying tangling of the
regular component in regions with interaction-enhanced star formation. Our data
combined with those in HI, Halpha, X-rays and in far infrared allow us to study
local interrelations between different gas phases and magnetic fields. We
distinguish several radio-emitting regions with different physical properties
and at various evolutionary stages. The whole overlapping region shows a
coherent magnetic field structure, probably tracing the line of collision
between the arms of merging spirals while the total radio emission reveals
hidden star formation nests. The southern part of it is a particularly intense
merger-triggered starburst. Highly tangled magnetic fields reach there
strengths of 30microG, even larger than in both individual galaxies, possibly
due to compression of the original fields pulled out from the parent disks. In
the northeastern ridge, away from star-forming regions, the magnetic field is
highly coherent with a strong regular component of 10microG tracing gas
shearing motions along the tidal tail. Modelling Faraday rotation data show
that we deal with a three-dimensionally curved structure of magnetic fields,
becoming almost parallel to the sky plane in the southeastern part of the

important the velocity anisotropy in non-spherical dark-matter haloes is for
dynamical friction. For this purpose we allow satellite galaxies to orbit
within flattened and live dark-matter haloes (DMHs) with aspect-ratio q_h=0.6
and compare the resulting orbit evolution with a semi-analytic code. This code
solves the equation of motion of satellites orbiting within the same DMH and
implements, according to the dynamical friction model, either Chandrasekhar's
formula, which does not incorporate the velocity anisotropy, or Binney's
description of dynamical friction in anisotropic systems. In the numerical and
the two semi-analytic models the satellites are given different initial orbital
inclinations and orbital eccentricities.
  We find that Binney's approach successfully describes the overall satellite
decay and orbital inclination decrease for the whole set of orbits, with an
averaged discrepancy of less than 4 per cent in orbital radius during the first
3 orbits. If Chandrasekhar's expression is used instead, the discrepancy
increases to 20 per cent and no inclination decrease can be observed. Binney's
treatment therefore appears to provide a significantly improved treatment of

of the intracluster medium (ICM), even at radii as large as half the virial
radius, is higher than that expected from gravitational processes alone. This
is thought to be the result of nongravitational processes influencing the
physical state of the ICM. In this paper, we investigate whether heating by a
central AGN can explain the distribution of excess entropy as a function of
radius. The AGN is assumed to inject buoyant bubbles into the ICM, which heat
the ambient medium by doing pdV work as they rise and expand. Several authors
have suggested that this ""effervescent heating"" mechanism could allow the
central regions of clusters to avoid the ``cooling catastrophe''. Here we study
the effect of effervescent heating at large radii. Our calculations show that
such a heating mechanism is able to solve the entropy problem. The only free
parameters of the model are the time-averaged luminosity and the AGN lifetime.
The results are mainly sensitive to the total energy injected into the cluster.
Our model predicts that the total energy injected by AGN should be roughly
proportional to the cluster mass. The expected correlation is consistent with a
linear relation between the mass of the central black hole(s) and the mass of
the cluster, which is reminiscent of the Magorrian relation between the black
hole and bulge mass.

is constituted, in large part, by non-baryonic collisionless particles with
very small primordial velocity dispersion. Such particles are called cold dark
matter (CDM). The leading candidates are axions and weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs). The word ``collisionless'' indicates that the particles are
so weakly interacting that they move purely under the influence of gravity.
Galaxies are surrounded by CDM and hence, because of gravity, CDM keeps falling
onto galaxies from all directions. CDM infall produces a discrete number of
flows and caustics in the halos of galaxies. There are two types of caustics in
the halos of galaxies: inner and outer. An outer caustic is a simple fold
catastrophe located on a topological sphere enveloping the galaxy. An inner
caustic is a closed tube whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic
catastrophe, with three cusps. In space, caustics are the boundaries that
separate regions with differing numbers of flows. One side of a caustic surface
has two more flows than the other. The density of CDM particles becomes very
large as one approaches the caustic from the side with the extra flows. Dark
matter caustics have specific density profiles and therefore precisely
calculable gravitational lensing properties. This dissertation presents a
formalism that simplifies the relevant calculations, and apply it to four
specific cases.

temperatures of different parts of the remnant are all around 0.7 keV, which is
surprisingly constant for a remnant with such rich structure. If thermal
conduction is responsible for smoothing the temperature gradient, a lower limit
on the thermal conductivity of $\sim$ 1/10 of the Spitzer value can be derived.
Thus, thermal conduction may play an important role in the evolution of at
least some SNRs. No spectral signature of the ejecta is found, which suggests
the ejecta material has been well mixed with the ambient medium. From the
morphology and the spectral properties, we suggest the bright inner shell is a
wind-driven shell (WDS) overtaken by the blast wave (the outer shell) and
estimate the age of the remnant to be $\sim$ 6 kyr for the assumed dynamics.
Projection is also required to explain the complicated morphology of Kes 79.

cross-correlation signal on the geometry and other properties of a survey of
the low redshift universe. We show that an all-sky survey with about 10 million
galaxies, almost uniformly distributed within 0<z<1 should yield a near optimal
ISW detection, at ~ 5\sigma level. In order to achieve this level of
signal-to-noise, the systematic anisotropies in the survey must be below ~ 0.1
%, on the scale of ~ 10 degrees on the sky, while the systematic error in
redshift estimates must be less than 0.05.

constraining the conventional properties of dark energy, it could be a valuable
means of testing alternative theories of gravity on large physical scales.

of medium resolution spectra, obtained at the Very Large Telescope. Our sample
comprises 468 radial velocities in the magnitude range 20 < m_R < 23. This is
the largest sample of globular cluster velocities around any galaxy obtained so
far. The radial range is 2 arcmin < r < 9 arcmin, corresponding to 11 kpc to 50
kpc of galactocentric distance. There is the possibility that unbound clusters
and/or objects in the foreground contaminate the NGC 1399 cluster sample. Under
strong error selection, practically no objects are found with velocities lower
than 800 km/s or higher than 2000 km/s. Since the extreme velocities influence
the velocity dispersion considerably, uncertainty regarding the exact value of
the dispersion remains. Within the above velocity limits, we derive a projected
velocity dispersion for the total sample of 274+-9 km/s which within the
uncertainties remains constant over the entire radial range. Without any
velocity restriction, it increases to 325 km/s. Blue and red clusters show
different dispersions corresponding to their different surface density
profiles. Spherical models point to a circular velocity of 415+-30$ km/s,
assuming isotropy for the red clusters. This value is constant out to 40 kpc.
The inferred dark halo potential can be well represented by a logarithmic
potential. Also a halo of the NFW type fits well to the observations. Some mass
profiles derived from X-ray analyses do not agree with a constant circular

{\it deflation (or anti-bubbles)} from January 1990 to December 2002. We find
that the volatility in the inflationary period is approximated by the
$q$-exponential distribution with $ q = 1.14 $ while the volatility
distribution in the deflationary period is accurately described by an {\it
exponential} distribution, that is, the $q$-exponential distribution with $ q

have occurred at the beginning of 1990 when the speculative bubble was

application of a magnetic field. We have found, however, that the low
temperature heat conduction of some solids increases by more than a factor of
two with the application of a modest magnetic field. The effect occurs in
low-dimensional magnetically ordered materials when a small gap, \delta, in the
acoustic magnon (spin wave) spectra is closed using a magnetic field H >
\delta/g\mu_B. Since all magnetically ordered materials must have a gap in the
magnon spectra for magnons with k = 0, this may be a very general effect. Extra
heat is carried through the solid only when the magentic field exceeds the
critical value (H > \delta/g\mu_B). At this critical field the tiny atomic
magnets in the solid abruptly change the direction they point which results in
more heat flowing through the material. The magnetic field thus acts as a heat
switch. We have observed this effect in three quite different magnetically
ordered materials: K_2V_3O_8, Nd_2CuO_4 and Pr_2CuO_4. Several possible
explanations for these effects will be discussed.

all the Fermi motion corrections arising from the relative motion of quarks

fraction probed by the process, due to the relative motion between c and

of N=4 gauge theory can be, perturbatively and, perhaps, non-perturbatively,
described by an integrable long range spin chain with elliptic exchange

limit of sufficiently ``long'' operators a Bethe ansatz exists, which we apply
at the perturbative two- and three-loop level. Spectacular agreement is found
with spinning string predictions of Frolov and Tseytlin for the two-loop
energies of certain large charge operators. However, we then go on to show that
the agreement between perturbative gauge theory and semi-classical string
theory begins to break down, in a subtle fashion, at the three-loop level. This
corroborates a recently found disagreement between three-loop gauge theory and
near plane-wave string theory results, and quantitatively explains a previously
obtained puzzling deviation between the string proposal and a numerical
extrapolation of finite size three-loop anomalous dimensions. At four loops and
beyond, we find that the Inozemtsev chain exhibits a generic breakdown of
perturbative BMN scaling. However, our proposal is not necessarily limited to
perturbation theory, and one would hope that the string theory results can be
recovered from the Inozemtsev chain at strong 't Hooft coupling.

and aggregation in myxobacteria. An efficient way of representing cells of
different cell size, shape and orientation is presented that may be easily
extended to model later stages of fruiting body formation. This LGCA model is
designed to investigate whether a refractory period, a minimum response time, a
maximum oscillation period and non-linear dependence of reversals of cells on
C-factor are necessary assumptions for rippling. It is shown that a refractory
period of 2-3 minutes, a minimum response time of up to 1 minute and no maximum
oscillation period best reproduce rippling in the experiments of {\it
Myxoccoccus xanthus}. Non-linear dependence of reversals on C-factor is
critical at high cell density. Quantitative simulations demonstrate that the
increase in wavelength of ripples when a culture is diluted with non-signaling
cells can be explained entirely by the decreased density of C-signaling cells.
This result further supports the hypothesis that levels of C-signaling
quantitatively depend on and modulate cell density. Analysis of the
interpenetrating high density waves shows the presence of a phase shift
analogous to the phase shift of interpenetrating solitons. Finally, a model for
swarming, aggregation and early fruiting body formation is presented.

equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge. A wide

theory. Such phenomena include: the noncommutativity of measurements,
interference, the multiplicity of convex decompositions of a mixed state, the
impossibility of discriminating nonorthogonal states, the impossibility of a
universal state inverter, the distinction between bi-partite and tri-partite
entanglement, the monogamy of pure entanglement, no cloning, no broadcasting,

algorithms of Grover \cite{g} and Ambainis \cite{amb03} and interpret them as
quantum walks with memory. We compare the performance of walk based classical
and quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general.
Let $P$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities $P[i,j]$, $(i
,j\in [n])$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that
the set of marked elements has size either zero or at least $\epsilon n$. The
goal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds.
Our model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can
generate random elements picked from certain distributions. More specifically,
by request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for
the cost of $\wp_{0}$. Also, when ``inserting'' an element $i$ into the black
box we can obtain a random element $j$, where $j$ is distributed according to
$P[i,j]$. The cost of the latter operation is $\wp_{1}$. Finally, we can use
the black box to test if an element $i$ is marked, and this costs us $\wp_{2}$.
If $\delta$ is the eigenvalue gap of $P$, there is a simple classical algorithm
with cost $O(\wp_{0} + (\wp_{1}+\wp_{2})/\delta\epsilon)$ that solves the above
promise problem. (The algorithm is efficient if $\wp_{0}$ is much larger than
$\wp_{1}+\wp_{2}$.) In contrast,we show that for the ``quantized'' version of
the algorithm it costs only $O(\wp_{0} +
(\wp_{1}+\wp_{2})/\sqrt{\delta\epsilon})$ to solve the problem. We refer to
this as the $\sqrt{\delta\epsilon}$ rule. Among the technical contributions we
give a formula for the spectrum of the product of two general reflections.
