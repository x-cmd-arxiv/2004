  Pollard",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In early type stars the ultraviolet spectral region is important for several
reasons. Firstly, since the majority of the total flux is emitted here, it
provides a rather sensitive indicator of a photospheric temperature and
luminosity. Secondly, the UV spectra are dominated by lines of the iron-group
elements, which cause the origin of the opacity bump at temperature $2 \times
10^5$ K, where the classical $\kappa$ mechanism drives pulsations of $\beta$
Cep stars. Consequently, the position of the instability domain in the HR
diagram strongly depends on the metal abundance (Pamyatnykh 1999).
  We derive stellar parameters (metallicity, [m/H], effective temperature,
$T_{\rm eff}$, stellar diameter, $\theta$) and interstellar extinction,
$E(B-V)$, for all $\beta$ Cep stars observed by {\it International Ultraviolet
Explorer} satellite. The parameters are derived by means of an algorithmic
procedure of fitting theoretical flux distributions to the low-resolution IUE
spectra and optical spectrophotometric observations. The errors are estimated
by using the bootstrap method (Press et al. 1992). We also show some examples
of high-resolution HST/GHRS spectra for one $\beta$ Cep star: $\gamma$ Peg.

the planet due to secular interactions with the disk material, the migration
rate depends linearly on the disk mass, and is independent of the initial
planet mass. For more massive disks, the planet can disturb the disk strongly
enough to trigger the collapse of gas into additional giant planets. When
additional planets form, their interaction as point masses dominates the
subsequent behavior of the system. This mechanism allows for the rapid
formation of Jupiter-mass and higher planets. Migration due to interaction with
the disk can significantly change the orbits of giant planets in gas disks.

emission from K I in the nebula. The extended emission is not just a reflected

the long-slit spectra, and most lines of sight intersect multiple distinct

appear to show a reflected spectrum, however, and suggests a systemic velocity
of +40 km/s with respect to the Sun. The most striking feature is blueshifted
emission from the filled interior of a large shell seen in images; the
kinematic structure is reminiscent of a Hubble flow, and provides strong
evidence for asymmetric and episodic mass loss due to localized eruptions on
the star's surface.

search for changes in quasar spectroscopic and flux variability properties with
redshift over three orders of magnitude in intrinsic X-ray luminosity. It
extends the study of quasar properties to unlensed X-ray flux levels as low as
a few times 10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the observed 0.4-8 keV band. We find
a possible correlation between the X-ray powerlaw photon index and X-ray
luminosity of the gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasar sample. The X-ray
spectral slope steepens as the X-ray luminosity increases. This correlation is
still significant when we combine our data with other samples of radio-quiet
quasars with z > 1.5, especially in the low luminosity range between
10^{43}-10^{45.5} erg s^{-1}. This result is surprising considering that such a
correlation is not found for quasars with redshifts below 1.5. We suggest that
this correlation can be understood in the context of the hot-corona model for
X-ray emission from quasar accretion disks, under the hypothesis that the
quasars in our sample accrete very close to their Eddington limits and the
observed luminosity range is set by the range of black hole masses (this
hypothesis is consistent with recent predictions of semi-analytic models for
quasar evolution). The upper limits of X-ray variability of our relatively high
redshift sample of lensed quasars are consistent with the known correlation
between variability and luminosity observed in Seyfert 1s when this correlation
is extrapolated to the larger luminosities of our sample.

than the globally hyperbolic geometries for which existence and uniqueness
theorems are traditionally proved. Simple examples are the time-nonorientable
spacetimes whose orientable double cover is globally hyperbolic. These
spacetimes have generalized Cauchy surfaces on which smooth initial data sets
yield unique solutions. A more difficult problem is to characterize the class
of spacetimes with closed timelike curves that admit a well-posed initial value
problem. Examples of spacetimes with closed timelike curves are given for which
smooth initial data at past null infinity has been recently shown to yield
solutions. These solutions appear to be unique, and uniquesness has been proved
in particular cases. Other examples, however, show that confining closed
timelike curves to compact regions is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness.
An approach to the characterization problem is suggested by the behavior of
congruences of null rays. Interacting fields have not yet been studied, but
particle models suggest that uniqueness (and possibly existence) is likely to
be lost as the strength of the interaction increases.

algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p >2$) whose Jacobians have
interesting $p$-torsion. For example, for every $0 \leq f \leq g$, we find the
dimension of the locus of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ with $p$-rank at
most $f$. We also produce families of curves so that the $p$-torsion of the
Jacobian of each fibre contains multiple copies of the group scheme $\alpha_p$.
The method is to study curves which admit an action by $(\ZZ/2)^n$ so that the
quotient is a projective line. As a result, some of these families intersect
the hyperelliptic locus $\CH_g$.

  Modulo 5","14 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables",,,,"math.CO math.NT",,"  In a recent study of sign-balanced, labelled posets Stanley [13], introduced
a new integral partition statistic srank(pi) = O(pi) - O(pi'), where O(pi)
denotes the number of odd parts of the partition pi and pi' the conjugate of
pi. In [1] Andrews proved the following refinement of Ramanujan's partition
congruence mod 5: p[0](5n +4) = p[2](5n + 4) = 0 (mod 5), p(n) = p[0](n) +
p[2](n), where p[i](n) (i = 0, 2) denotes the number of partitions of n with
srank = i (mod 4) and p(n) is the number of unrestricted partitions of n.
Andrews asked for a partition statistic that would divide the partitions
enumerated by p[i](5n + 4) (i = 0, 2) into five equinumerous classes. In this
paper we discuss two such statistics. The first one, while new, is intimately
related to the Andrews-Garvan [2] crank. The second one is in terms of the
5-core crank, introduced by Garvan, Kim and Stanton [9]. Finally, we discuss
some new formulas for partitions that are 5-cores.

been developed such that all partons hadronize by recombination. The
fragmentation of a hard parton is accounted for by the recombination of shower
partons that it creates. Such shower partons can also recombine with the
thermal partons to form particles that dominate over all other possible modes
of hadronization in the $3<p_T<8$ GeV range. The results for the high \pt
spectra of pion, kaon, and proton agree well with experiments. Energy loss of
partons in the dense medium is taken into account on the average by an
effective parameter by fitting data, and is found to be universal independent
of the type of particles produced, as it should. Due to the recombination of
thermal and shower partons, the structure of jets produced in nuclear
collisions is different from that in $pp$ collisions. The consequence on
same-side correlations is discussed.

is generalized so that polarization of light is included. Starting from a
Lippmann-Schwinger formalism for vector waves, we show that the Green function
has to be regularized before T-matrices can be defined in a consistent way.
After the regularization, optical modes and Green functions are determined
exactly for finite structures built up of an arbitrary number of parallel
planes, at arbitrary positions, and where each plane can have different optical
properties. The model is applied to the special case of finite crystals
consisting of regularly spaced identical planes, where analytical methods can
be taken further and only light numerical tasks remain. The formalism is used
to calculate position- and orientation-dependent spontaneous-emission rates
inside and near the finite photonic crystals. The results show that emission
rates and reflection properties can differ strongly for scalar and for vector
waves. The finite size of the crystal influences the emission rates. For
parallel dipoles close to a plane, emission into guided modes gives rise to a
peak in the frequency-dependent emission rate.

Boolean rules are remarkably stable, whereas those with random Boolean rules
are only marginally stable. Furthermore, substantial parts of the generated
networks are frozen, in the sense that they reach the same state regardless of
initial state. Thus, our ensemble approach suggests that the yeast network
shows highly ordered dynamics.
