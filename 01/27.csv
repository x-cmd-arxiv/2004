any underlying continuum emission. Line emission, and the associated RRC, are
clearly detected from hydrogen-like and helium-like ionization states of neon,
oxygen, nitrogen and carbon. The measured lines are blueshifted with a velocity
of between ~100-1000 km/s, with respect to the systemic velocity of NGC 4151,
approximately consistent with the outflow velocities of the absorption lines

  From radio observations of BN's proper motion, we trace its trajectory back
to Trapezium star theta^1C, the most massive (45 Msun) in the cluster and a
relatively tight (17 AU) visual binary with a B star secondary. This origin
would be the most recent known runaway B star ejection event, occurring only
\~4000 yr ago and providing a unique test of models of ejection from multiple

(~7 Msun) from both its bolometric luminosity and the recoil of theta^1C.
Interaction of a runaway B star with dense ambient gas should produce a compact
wind bow shock. We suggest that X-ray emission from this shocked gas may have
been seen by Chandra: the offset from the radio position is ~300 AU in the
direction of BN's motion. Given this model, we constrain the ambient density,
wind mass-loss rate and wind velocity. BN made closest approach to the massive

that they are surrounded by giant HII regions, a few Mpc in size. The neutral
gas around these HII regions should emit 21cm radiation in excess of the Cosmic
Microwave Background, and enable future radio telescopes to measure the
transverse extent of these HII regions. At early times, the HII regions expand
with a relativistic speed. Consequently, their measured sizes along the
line-of-sight (via Ly-alpha absorption) and transverse to it (via 21 cm
emission) should have different observed values due to relativistic time-delay.
We show that the combined measurement of these sizes would directly constrain
the neutral fraction of the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM) as well as
the quasar lifetime. Based on current number counts of luminous quasars at z>6,
an instrument like LOFAR should detect >2 redshifted 21cm shells per field
(with a radius of 11 degrees) around active quasars as bright as those already
discovered by SDSS, and >200 relic shells of inactive quasars per field. We
show that Ly-alpha photons from the quasar are unable to heat the IGM or to
couple the spin and kinetic temperatures of atomic hydrogen beyond the edge of
the HII region. The detection of the IGM in 21cm emission around high redshift

entire cooling epoch.Because the strong magnetic field forces the wind to
co-rotate with the protoneutron star,this outflow can significantly effect the
neutron star's early angular momentum evolution, as in analogous models of
stellar winds (e.g. Weber & Davis 1967). If the rotational energy is large in
comparison with the supernova energy and the spindown timescale is short with
respect to the time required for the supernova shockwave to traverse the
stellar progenitor, the energy extracted may modify the supernova shock
dynamics significantly. This effect is capable of producing hyper-energetic
supernovae and, in some cases, provides conditions favorable for gamma ray
bursts. We estimate spindown timescales for magnetized, rotating protoneutron
stars and construct steady-state models of neutrino-magnetocentrifugally driven

predicted forms of $w(z)$ and $H(z)$ at best fit. The worst fit among the

achieved by the three parameter oscillating ansatz ($\chi_{min}^2 = 194.1$).
Most of the best fit ansatze have an equation of state parameter $w(z)$ that
varies between $w(z) \simeq -1$ for $z<0.5$ to $w(z) > 0$ for $z>1$. This
implies that the sign of the pressure of the dark energy may be alternating as
the redshift increases. The goodness of fit of the oscillating $H(z)$ ansatz
lends further support to this possibility.

combination with previous, shorter wavelengths, HST images. We find that the

dependent on the wavelength. This is inconsistent with dust models inferred
from observations of the interstellar medium or dense molecular clouds. In
particular, the strongly forward-throwing scattering phase function observed at

micron) grains, which provides direct evidence for grain growth in the ring.
However, the grain size distribution required to match the 3.8 micron image of

that the dust population is not uniform throughout the ring. We also show that
our 3.8 micron scattered light image probes a deeper layer of the ring than
previous shorter wavelength images, as demonstrated by a shift in the location
of the inner edge of the disk's scattered light distribution between 1 and 3.8

surface layers, located ~50 AU above the ring midplane, contain dust grains
that are very similar to those found in dense molecular clouds, while the

of states on the gravitational wave signals. With these computations, we find
that the peak amplitudes are lowered by an order of 10% for the models with the
strongest toroidal magnetic fields. However, the peak amplitudes are mostly
within sensitivity range of laser interferometers such as TAMA and the first
LIGO for a source at a distance of 10 kpc. Furthermore, we point out that the
amplitudes of second peaks are still within the detection limit of the first
LIGO for the source, although the characteristics of second peaks are reduced
by the magnetic fields. We stress the importance of the detection, since it
will give us information about the angular momentum distribution of massive
evolved stars. When we compare the gravitational waves from the two realistic
equation of states, significant differences are not found, except that the
typical frequencies of the gravitational wave become slightly higher for the
softer equation of state.

on the evolution of the system whenever the collisionless skin depth is less

resistive MHD limit initially reaches equipartition with flow energy, in
accordance with ideal MHD, and is then dissipated extremely rapidly, on an
Alfvenic timescale that is essentially independent of Lundquist number. In
agreement with resistive MHD results obtained by previous authors, the magnetic
field energy and kinetic energy are then observed to decay on a longer
timescale and exhibit oscillatory behavior, reflecting the existence of
discrete normal modes with finite real frequency. When the collisionless skin
depth exceeds the resistive scale length, the system again evolves initially
according to ideal MHD. At the end of this ideal phase, the field energy decays
typically on an Alfvenic timescale, while the kinetic energy (which is equally
partitioned between ions and electrons in this case) is dissipated on the
electron collision timescale. The oscillatory decay in the energy observed in
the resistive case is absent, but short wavelength structures appear in the
field and velocity profiles, suggesting the possibility of particle
acceleration in oppositely-directed current channels. The model provides a
possible framework for interpreting observations of energy release and particle
acceleration on timescales down to less than a second in the impulsive phase of

adaptive mesh that allows us to adequately resolve both the inner spiral turns
(sub-AU scales) and the outer regions of the nebula (distances of 10^4 AU from
the central source). The spiral model provides a good fit to both the spectral
energy distribution and Keck aperture masking interferometry, reproducing both
the maximum entropy recovered images and the visibility curves. We deduce a
dust creation rate of 8+-1 x 10^{-7} solar masses per year, corresponding to
approximately 2% by mass of the carbon produced by the Wolf-Rayet star.
Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral data enables us to constrain
both the opening-angle of the wind-wind collision interface and the dust grain
size. We conclude that the dust grains in the inner part of the Pinwheel nebula
are small (~100A), in agreement with theoretical predictions, although we
cannot rule out the presence of larger grains (~1 micron) further from the
central binary. The opening angle of the wind-wind collision interface appears
to be about 40 degrees, in broad agreement with the wind parameters estimated

respect to the global symmetry direction. More importantly, on the basis of the

harmonic generation and intermodulation (IM) distortion at all levels of
circulating power. The dominant sources of IM response are believed to be
inductive and localized in only small regions of the HTS film having the
highest current densities J_RF(x,y). In our previous papers, examining
microwave resonators of simple microstrip geometry, we have demonstrated that
local nonlinearity imaging is possible with the technique of low temperature

contrast due to IM current density J_IM(x,y) was generated by the IM imaging

non-linearity arises from the highly non-linear adiabatic evolution and (or)
from an admixture of parts of it in so-called intermediate states, and the
other kind from non-quadratic transition rates between adiabatic states. The
resulting macroscopic dc-current may or may not be linear in the field. Three
cases can be distinguished : (a) The microscopic non-linearities can be
neglected. This is assumed to be the case in linear response theory (Kubo
formalism, ...). We give arguments which make it plausible that often such an
assumption is indeed justified, in particular for the current parallel to the
field. (b) The microscopic non-linearitites lead to macroscopic
non-linearities. An example is the onset of dissipation by increasing the
electric field in the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect. (c) The macroscopic
current is linear although the microscopic non-linearities constitute an
essential part of it and cannot be neglected. We show that the Hall current of
a quantized Hall plateau belongs to this case. This illustrates that
macroscopic linearity does not necessarily result from microscopic linearity.
In the second and third cases linear response theory is inadequate. We
elucidate also some other problems related to linear response theory.

suggest the universality of the absolute value of the skewness S = W_3 /

the skewness is the same of the parameter \lambda of the KPZ equation which
represents the process in the continuum limit. The best numerical estimates,
obtained from the etching model, are |S| = 0.26 +- 0.01 and Q = 0.134 +- 0.015.
For this model, the roughness exponent \alpha = 0.383 +- 0.008 is obtained,
accounting for a constant correction term (intrinsic width) in the scaling of
the squared interface width. This value is slightly below previous estimates of
extensive simulations and rules out the proposal of the exact value \alpha=2/5.
The conclusion is supported by results for the ballistic deposition model.
Independent estimates of the dynamical exponent and of the growth exponent are
1.605 <= z <= 1.64 and \beta = 0.229 +- 0.005, respectively, which are
consistent with the relations \alpha + z = 2 and z = \alpha / \beta.

coupling of the radion to the Standard Model fields. The identification of the
radion as a canonically normalized field involves a careful General Relativity
treatment: if a bulk scalar is responsible for the stabilization of the system,
its fluctuations are entangled with the perturbations of the metric and they
also have to be taken into account (similarly to the well-developed theory of
scalar metric perturbations in 4D cosmology with a scalar field). Extracting a
proper dynamical variable in a warped geometry/scalar setting is a nontrivial
task, performed so far only in the limit of negligible backreaction of the
scalar field on the background geometry. We perform the general calculation,
diagonalizing the action up to second order in the perturbations and
identifying the physical eigenmodes of the system for any amplitude of the bulk
scalar. This computation allows us to derive a very simple expression for the
exact coupling of the eigenmodes to the Standard Model fields on the brane,
valid for an arbitrary background configuration. As an application, we discuss
the Goldberger-Wise mechanism for the stabilization of the radion in the
Randall-Sundrum type models. The existing studies, limited to small amplitude
of the bulk scalar field, are characterized by a radion mass which is
significantly below the physical scale at the observable brane. We extend them
beyond the small backreaction regime. For intermediate amplitudes, the radion
mass approaches the electroweak scale, while its coupling to the observable
brane remains nearly constant. At very high amplitudes, the radion mass instead
decreases, while the coupling sharply increases. Severe experimental
constraints are expected in this regime.

family unification and grand unification theory, this time under the assumption
that there is a vacuum gluino condensate, but that this condensate is {\it not}
accompanied by dynamical generation of a mass gap in the pure $E_8$ gauge
theory. Arguments supporting these assumptions are given. When the $E_8$ theory
is coupled to supergravity, assuming vanishing of the cosmological constant and
a supersymmetry breaking scale of around a TeV, we show that the gluino mass
induced by gravitational coupling to the condensate is of order $10^{-3}$ eV or
smaller, compatible with the fermion (and particularly the neutrino) mass

unification group, times a SU(3) family symmetry group and an extra U(1)
factor. A general analysis of the Higgs superpotential shows that in the
absence of gravitational couplings, there is always a supersymmetric vacuum in
the (unphysical) limit of infinite Higgs superfields. However, when
gravitational couplings are included, dimensional analysis of the
superpotential shows that the vacuum can be stabilized for finite Higgs
superfields, with the occurrence of dynamical ${\cal F}$-type supersymmetry
breaking. We conclude that an $E_8$ unification may be theoretically viable,
providing an alternative paradigm for low energy model building, in which the
supersymmetric partners of the standard model fermions are vectors, and in
which the only chiral superfields are symmetry breaking Higgs fields.

  if you know of results similar to Theorem 3.4 in this paper",,,,"math.CV math.GT",,"  The valence of a function $f$ at a point $w$ is the number of distinct,
finite solutions to $f(z) = w$. Let $f$ be a complex-valued harmonic function
in an open set $R \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. Let $S$ denote the critical set of $f$
and $C(f)$ the global cluster set of $f$. We show that $f(S) \cup C(f)$
partitions the complex plane into regions of constant valence. We give some
conditions such that $f(S) \cup C(f)$ has empty interior. We also show that a
component $R_0 \subseteq R \backslash f^{-1}(f(S) \cup C(f))$ is a $n_0$-fold
covering of some component $\Omega_0 \subseteq \mathbb{C} \backslash (f(S) \cup
C(f))$. If $\Omega_0$ is simply connected, then $f$ is univalent on $R_0$. We
explore conditions for combining adjacent components to form a larger region of
univalence. Those results which hold for $C^1$ functions on open sets in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ are first stated in that form and then applied to the case of
planar harmonic functions. If $f$ is a light, harmonic function in the complex
plane, we apply a structure theorem of Lyzzaik to gain information about the
difference in valence between components of $\mathbb{C} \backslash (f(S) \cup
C(f))$ sharing a common boundary arc in $f(S) \backslash C(f)$.

Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space of flat connections over $\S$ that
arises from the restrictions to the boundary of flat connections on a handle

bounded energy near $\{0\}\times\S$: Either their curvature is in fact
uniformly bounded in a neighbourhood of that slice (leading to a compactness
result) or there is a concentration of some minimum quantum of energy. We
moreover obtain a removable singularity result for instantons with finite

analytic foundations for the construction of an instanton Floer homology for

energy modulation within a slice of the electron bunch. Following the energy
modulator the electron beam enters the X-ray undulator and produces SASE

longitudinal position within the few-cycle-driven slice of SASE radiation

funnels. Guided by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we
transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion in the
presence of an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The
free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression
for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the
required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive
interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10^4-10^6 M-1
s-1, several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely
probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of
uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct
alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates
of many protein-protein complexes are also in the 10^5-10^6 M-1 s-1, our
results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or
side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the
binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model,
do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein-protein association.
The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes
association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein-protein
binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations.

a substantial number of model webs on which deletion experiments could be

determined, on average, how many species were eliminated from the web as a
result. Typically only a small number of species became extinct; in no instance
was the web close to collapse. Next, we examined how the the probability of
extinction of a species depended on its relationship with the deleted species.
This involved the exploration of the concept of indirect predator and prey
species and the extent that the probability of extinction depended on the
trophic level of the two species. The effect of deletions on the web itself was
studied by searching for keystone species, whose removal caused a major
restructuring of the community, and also by looking at the correlation between
a number of food web properties (number of species, linkage density, fraction
of omnivores, degree of cycling and redundancy) and the stability of the web to
deletions. With the exception of redundancy, we found little or no correlation.

  will appear in the Journal of Mathematical Physics. 24 pages, no figures",,"10.1063/1.1771482",,"quant-ph",,"  $p$-Mechanics is a consistent physical theory which describes both classical
and quantum mechanics simultaneously through the representation theory of the
Heisenberg group. In this paper we describe how non-linear canonical
transformations affect $p$-mechanical observables and states. Using this we
show how canonical transformations change a quantum mechanical system. We seek
an operator on the set of $p$-mechanical observables which corresponds to the
classical canonical transformation. In order to do this we derive a set of
integral equations which when solved will give us the coherent state expansion
of this operator. The motivation for these integral equations comes from the
work of Moshinsky and a variety of collaborators. We consider a number of
examples and discuss the use of these equations for non-bijective
transformations.

  Rotor with Amplitude Noise","9 pages, four figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.70.036217",,"quant-ph",,"  The effect of pulse train noise on the quantum resonance peaks of the Atom
Optics Kicked Rotor is investigated experimentally. Quantum resonance peaks in
the late time mean energy of the atoms are found to be surprisingly robust
against all levels of noise applied to the kicking amplitude, whilst even small
levels of noise on the kicking period lead to their destruction. The robustness
to amplitude noise of the resonance peak and of the fall--off in mean energy to
either side of this peak are explained in terms of the occurence of stable,
$\epsilon$--classical dynamics [S. Wimberger, I. Guarneri, and S. Fishman,
\textit{Nonlin.} \textbf{16}, 1381 (2003)] around each quantum resonance.

invariant under a centrally extended superalgebra endowed with an additional
symmetry generator, which we dub the shift operator. The familiar mathematical
and physical results of shape invariance then arise from the BPS structure
associated with this shift operator. The shift operator also ensures that there
is a one-to-one correspondence between the energy levels of such a model and
the energies of the BPS-saturating states. These findings thus provide a more
comprehensive algebraic setting for understanding shape invariance.

measurements performed by the detectors outside the system. If the outside
detectors are prepared to observe propagating signals of a decay event of an
excited state in the core region, the survival probability of the state is not
changed at all by the outside measurements, as long as the wavefunction of the
signals does not have reflectional-wave contributions going back to the core by
the outside detectors. The proof is independendent of the decay law of the
survival probabilities. Just watching frequently from outside (observation)
cannot be regarded as a measurement which yields the quantum Zeno effect.

  Theory","submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A positive P-representation for the spin-j thermal density matrix is given in
closed form. The representation is constructed by regarding the wave function
as the internal state of a closed-loop control system. A continuous
interferometric measurement process is proved to einselect coherent states, and
feedback control is proved to be equivalent to a thermal reservoir. Ito
equations are derived, and the P-representation is obtained from a
Fokker-Planck equation. Langevin equations are derived, and the force noise is
shown to be the Hilbert transform of the measurement noise. The formalism is
applied to magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) and gravity wave (GW)
interferometry. Some unsolved problems relating to drift and diffusion on
Hilbert spaces are noted.

discriminated is specified by the quantum state of a program qubit. The second
device can perform von Neumann measurements on a single qubit in any basis
located on the equator of the Bloch sphere. Again, the basis is selected by the
state of a program qubit. In both cases the data and program qubits are
represented by polarization states of photons. The experimental apparatus
exploits the fact that two Bell states can be distinguished solely by means of
linear optics. The outcome corresponding to the remaining two Bell states
represents an inconclusive result.
