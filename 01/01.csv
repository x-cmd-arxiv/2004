accreting from a binary companion and is thus a quiescent low-mass X-ray
binary. If the companion is a main-sequence star, then the faint absolute
magnitude (M_625 ~ 11.6) constrains it to be of very low mass (M <~ 0.14

accretion onto the neutron star. We also detect 13 probable white dwarfs and
three possible BY Draconis stars in the 20"" x 20"" region analyzed here,

structural stability of cooling flows that are episodically heated by jets from
a central AGN. The radial profile of energy deposition is controlled by (a) the
power of the jets, and (b) the pre-outburst density profile. A delay in the
ignition of the jets causes more powerful jets to impact on a more centrally
concentrated medium. The net effect is a sufficient increase in the central
concentration of energy deposition to cause the post-outburst density profile
to be less centrally concentrated than that of an identical cluster in which
the outburst happened earlier and was weaker. These results suggest that the
density profiles of cooling flows oscillate around an attracting profile, thus
explaining why cooling flows are observed to have similar density profiles. The
possibility is raised that powerful FR II systems are ones in which this
feedback mechanism has broken down and a runaway growth of the source
parameters has occurred.

to a spherical harmonic index l=1. The higher indices l geq 2 indicate
intrinsic inhomogeneities in the Universe that existed at the time of last

energies even in the presence of Planck scale lepton number violation. The
geometrical picture in five dimensions assumes that the lepton number symmetry
is explicitly broken on the Planck brane while the right-handed neutrino is
localised on the TeV brane. This physical separation in the bulk causes the
global lepton number to be preserved at low energies. A small wavefunction
overlap between the left-handed and right-handed neutrinos then naturally leads
to a small Dirac Yukawa coupling. By the AdS/CFT correspondence there exists a
purely four-dimensional dual description in which the right-handed neutrino is
a composite CFT bound state. The global lepton number is violated at the Planck
scale in a fundamental sector whose mixing into the composite sector is highly
suppressed by CFT operators with large anomalous dimensions. A similar small
mixing is then also responsible for generating a naturally small Dirac Yukawa
coupling between the fundamental left-handed neutrino and the composite
right-handed neutrino.

gravity coupled to matter. In the 2d gravity formulation the central charge of
the matter together with a hidden dimension from the conformal factor or
Liouville mode determines the Target space dimension. Also the vacuum amplitude
of the 2d gravity formulation implies important constraints on the Target space
theory associated with modular invariance. In this paper we study a three
dimensional gravity approach to M-theory. We find that there are three hidden
Liouville type fields coming from the 3d gravity sector and that these together
with the number of zero modes of the matter fields determine an eleven
dimensional Target space of M theory. We investigate the perturbative vacuum
amplitude for the 3d gravity approach to M theory and constraints imposed from
SL(3,Z) modular invariance using a method of Dolan and Nappi together with a
sum over spin structures which generalizes the SL(2,Z) invariance found in
string theory. To introduce gauge fields in M-theory we study the vacuum
amplitude on a three annulus and introduce interactions with two dimensional
matter on a boundary in analogy with the introduction of gauge fields for open
string theory. We study a three dimensional version of M-theory from the 3d

the unit volume constraint of that equation to a scalar curvature constraint.
The resulting equations are named the Conformal Ricci Flow Equations because of
the role that conformal geometry plays in constraining the scalar curvature.
These equations are analogous to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of
fluid mechanics inasmuch as a conformal pressure arises as a Lagrange
multiplier to conformally deform the metric flow so as to maintain the scalar
curvature constraint. The equilibrium points are Einstein metrics with a
negative Einstein constant and the conformal pressue is shown to be zero at an
equilibrium point and strictly positive otherwise. The geometry of the
conformal Ricci flow is discussed as well as the remarkable analytic fact that
the constraint force does not lose derivatives and thus analytically the
conformal Ricci equation is a bounded perturbation of the classical
unnormalized Ricci equation. That the constraint force does not lose
derivatives is exactly analogous to the fact that the real physical pressure
force that occurs in the Navier-Stokes equations is a bounded function of the
velocity. Using a nonlinear Trotter product formula, existence and uniqueness
of solutions to the conformal Ricci flow equations is proven. Lastly, we
discuss potential applications to Perelman's proposed implementation of

distinguishable optical coherent states can be generated using a single photon
source and simple all-optical operations. Weak squeezing on a single photon,
beam mixing with an auxiliary coherent state, and photon detecting with
imperfect threshold detectors are enough to generate a coherent state
superposition in a free propagating optical field with a large coherent
amplitude ($\alpha>2$) and high fidelity ($F>0.99$). In contrast to all
previous schemes to generate such a state, our scheme does not need photon
number resolving measurements nor Kerr-type nonlinear interactions.
Furthermore, it is robust to detection inefficiency and exhibits some
resilience to photon production inefficiency.
