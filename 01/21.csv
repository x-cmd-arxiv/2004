particular, from our multi-wavelength analysis, we re-examined the
long-standing metallicity spread problem in M~22. According to our dataset, we
conclude that most of the observed width of the red giant branch must be due to
differential reddening, which amounts to a maximum of $\Delta
E(B-V)\simeq0.06$, although the presence of a small metallicity spread cannot
be completely ruled out. More specifically, the maximum metallicity spread
allowed by our data is of the order of $\Delta$[Fe/H]$\simeq 0.1\div 0.2$ dex,
i.e., not much more than what allowed by the photometric errors. Finally, we
identified most of the known variable stars and peculiar objects in our field

such as COROT, Eddington and Kepler, will need to address problems associated
with the automated and efficient detection of planetary transits in light
curves affected by a variety of noise sources, including stellar variabilility.
Starting from a general purpose maximum likelihood approach we discuss the
links between a variety of period and transit finding methods. The natural
endpoint of this hierarchy of methods is shown to be a fast, robust and
statistically efficient least-squares algorithm based on box-shaped transits.
  This approach is predicated on the assumption of periodic transits hidden in
random noise, usually assumed to be superposed on a flat continuum with regular
continuous sampling. We next show how to generalise the transit finding method
to the more realistic scenario where complex stellar (micro) variability,
irregular sampling and long gaps in the data are all present. Tests of this
methodology on simulated Eddington light curves including realistic stellar
micro-variability, irregular sampling and data gaps, are used to quantify the
performance. In the case where transit durations are short compared to the
dominant timescales for stellar variability and data record segments, it is
possible to decouple the transit signal from the remainder.
  We conclude that even with realistic contamination from stellar variability,
irregular sampling, and gaps in the data record, it is still possible to detect
transiting planets with an efficiency close to the idealised theoretical bound.
In particular, space missions have the potential to approach the regime of
detecting earth-like planets around G2V-type stars.

The perturbations are assumed to be static in the local plasma rest frame.
Their flat or Kolmogorov spectra are constructed with randomly drawn wave

particle spectra and angular distributions obtained at mildly relativistic sub-

subluminal shocks and formation of power-law tails at superluminal ones are

magnetic field perturbations leads to the formation of locally oblique field
configurations at the shock and the respective magnetic field compressions.
This results in the modification of the particle acceleration process,
introducing some features present in oblique shocks, e.g., particle reflections
from the shock. We demonstrate for parallel shocks a (nonmonotonic) variation

Population III stars were very massive and short-lived stars that formed at
$z\sim 10-20$ at rare peaks of the density field in the cold-dark-matter
Universe. Because Population III stars probably formed individually in small
mini-halos, they are not directly accessible to current telescopic studies. We
show that these stars left a strong and measurable signature via their
contribution to the CIB anisotropies for a wide range of their formation
scenarios. The excess in the recently measured near-IR CIB anisotropies over
that from normal galaxies can be explained by contribution from early
Population III stars. These results imply that Population III were indeed very
massive stars and their epoch started at $z\sim 20$ and lasted past $z\lsim
13$. We show the importance of accurately measuring the CIB anisotropies
produced by Population III with future space-based missions.

density fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. We
measure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts in

demonstrate that $L_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order

translates the isocurvature perturbations into the curvature perturbations.
  If all light fields make similar contributions to the potential energy, the
postinflationary curvature perturbations are much smaller than the standard
inflationary curvature perturbations. But if different light fields make very
different contributions to the potential energy, the postinflationary curvature
perturbations can exceed the inflationary perturbations. The characteristic
feature of postinflationary perturbations is non-Gaussianity $\sim \pm 1$.

extrasolar planetary systems, and their geometry can provide information about
the origin of the resonances. Assembly during planet formation by the
differential migration of planets due to planet-disk interaction is one
scenario for the origin of mean-motion resonances in extrasolar planetary
systems. The stable 2:1 resonance configurations that can be reached by
differential migration of planets with constant masses and initially coplanar
and nearly circular orbits are (1) anti-symmetric configurations with the
mean-motion resonance variables theta_1 and theta_2 (in deg.) librating about 0
and 180, respectively (as in the Io-Europa pair), (2) symmetric configurations
with both theta_1 and theta_2 librating about 0 (as in the GJ 876 system), and
(3) asymmetric configurations with theta_1 and theta_2 librating about angles
far from either 0 or 180. There are, however, stable 2:1 resonance
configurations with symmetric (theta_1 = theta_2 = 0), asymmetric, and
anti-symmetric (theta_1 = 180 and theta_2 = 0) librations that cannot be
reached by differential migration of planets with constant masses and initially

are ever found, their origin would require (1) a change in the planetary mass
ratio m_1/m_2 during migration, (2) a migration scenario involving inclination
resonances, or (3) multiple-planet scattering in crowded planetary systems. We
find that the asymmetric configurations with large e_2 and the theta_1 = 180

These results are consistent from star-to-star with no significant spatial
variations over a length of 0.8 kpc in Sextans A. This supports the nebular
abundance studies of dwarf irregular galaxies, where homogeneous oxygen

stark contrast with the high [alpha/Fe] results from metal-poor stars in the

the effects of the newly-derived microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) mass
formulas on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis and analyse to what extent a
solar-like $r$-abundance distribution can be obtained. The $r$-process
calculations with the HFB-2 mass formula are performed, adopting the
parametrized model of the prompt explosion from a collapsing O-Ne-Mg core for
the physical conditions and compared with the results obtained with the HFB-7

magic numbers in the neutron-rich region, the microscopic mass formulas (HFB-2

of the $r$-process peaks ($A = 130$ and 195). While this effect resolves the
large underproduction at $A \approx 115$ and 140 obtained with droplet-type
mass formulas, large deviations compared to the solar pattern are found near
the third $r$-process peak. It is shown that a solar-like $r$-process pattern
can be obtained if the dynamical timescales of the outgoing mass trajectories
are increased by a factor of about 2-3, or if the $\beta$-decay rates are
systematically increased by the same factor.

weak than with strong [OI]. Weak-[OI] LLAGN that have young stars stand out for
their intermediate age population. (4) Most of the strong-[OI] LLAGN have

feature-less continuum that contributes significantly to the optical continuum.
These results suggest that young and intermediate age stars do not play a

ionization in weak-[OI] LLAGN with young and/or intermediate age population
could be due to stellar processes.

especially relevant for G dwarfs in the 3-15 Gyr range of ages, crucial to the
study of the chemical and dynamical history of the Galaxy.
  We apply our method to the classic sample of Edvardsson et al. (1993), who
derived the age-metallicity relation (AMR) of a sample of 189 field dwarfs with
precisely determined abundances. Using new parallax, temperature and
metallicity data, our age determination for the Edvardsson et al. sample
indicates that the intrinsic dispersion in the AMR is at most 0.15 dex and
probably lower. In particular, we show that old, metal-rich objects ([Fe/H]\sim
0.0 dex, age > 5 Gyr) and young, metal-poor objects ([Fe/H]<-0.5 dex, age < 6
Gyr) in many observed AMR plots are artifacts caused by a too simple treatment
of the age determination, and that the Galactic AMR is monotonically increasing

  Figures, 6 Tables",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A new interaction, plasma redshift, is derived, which is important only when
photons penetrate a hot, sparse electron plasma. The derivation of plasma
redshift is based entirely on conventional axioms of physics. When photons
penetrate a cold and dense plasma, they lose energy through ionization and
excitation, Compton scattering on the individual electrons, and Raman
scattering on the plasma frequency. But in sparse hot plasma, such as in the
solar corona, the photons lose energy also in plasma redshift. The energy loss
per electron in the plasma redshift is about equal to the product of the
photon's energy and one half of the Compton cross-section per electron. In
quiescent solar corona, this heating starts in the transition zone to the
corona and is a major fraction of the coronal heating. Plasma redshift
contributes also to the heating of the interstellar plasma, the galactic
corona, and the intergalactic plasma. Plasma redshift explains the solar
redshifts, the redshifts of the galactic corona, the cosmological redshifts,
the cosmic microwave background, and the X-ray background. The plasma redshift
explains the observed magnitude-redshift relation for supernovae SNe Ia without
the big bang, dark matter, or dark energy. There is no cosmic time dilation.
The universe is not expanding. The plasma redshift, when compared with
experiments, shows that the photons' classical gravitational redshifts are
reversed as the photons move from the Sun to the Earth. This is a quantum
mechanical effect. As seen from the Earth, a repulsion force acts on the
photons. This means that there is no need for Einstein's Lambda term. The
universe is quasi-static, infinite, and everlasting.

clusters exhibit distorted X-ray morphology and strong gas temperature
variations indicating ongoing mergers. Some clusters, e.g., A520, A665,
1E0657-56, exhibit the previously reported spatial correlation between the
radio halo brightness and the hot gas regions. However, it is not a general
feature. While most mergers are too messy to allow us to disentangle the
projection effects, we find clear counterexamples (e.g., A754 and A773) where
the hottest gas regions do not exhibit radio emission at the present
sensitivity level. This cannot be explained by projection effects, and
therefore argues against merger shocks -- at least those relatively weak ones
responsible for the observed temperature structure in most clusters -- as the
main mechanism for the halo generation. This leaves merger-generated turbulence
as a more likely mechanism. The two clusters with the clearest radio brightness
- temperature correlation, A520 and 1E0657-56, are both mergers in which a
small dense subcluster has just passed through the main cluster, very likely
generating turbulence in its wake. The maximum radio brightness and the hot gas
are both seen in these wake regions. On the other hand, the halos in 1E0657-56
and A665 (both high-velocity mergers) extend into the shock regions in front of
the subclusters, where no strong turbulence is expected. Thus, in high-velocity
(M=2-3) mergers, both shock and turbulence acceleration mechanisms may be
significant.

cluster Pal5, its very low mass and velocity dispersion, and its size, which is
much larger than the theoretical tidal radius, we performed more than 1000
N-body simulations. Tidal shocks at disk crossings near perigalacticon dominate
the evolution of extended low-concentration clusters, resulting in massive
tidal tails and often in a quick destruction of the cluster. The overlarge size
of Pal5 can be explained as the result of an expansion following the heating
induced by the last strong disk shock ~150Myr ago. The models can reproduce the
low observed velocity dispersion and the relative fractions of stars in the
tails and between the inner and outer parts of the tails. The tidal tails of
Pal5 show substantial structure not seen in our simulations. We argue that this
structure is probably caused by Galactic substructure, such as giant molecular
clouds, spiral arms, and dark-matter clumps.
  Clusters initially larger than their theoretical tidal limit remain so,
because, after being shocked, they settle into a new equilibrium near
apogalacticon, where they are unaffected by the perigalactic tidal field. This
implies that, contrary to previous wisdom, globular clusters on eccentric
orbits may well remain super-tidally limited and hence vulnerable to strong
disk shocks, which dominate their evolution until destruction. Our simulations
unambiguously predict the destruction of Pal5 at its next disk crossing in
\~110Myr. This corresponds to only 1% of the cluster lifetime, suggesting that
many more similar systems could once have populated the inner parts of the
Milky Way, but have been transformed into debris streams by the Galactic tidal
field. (Abridged)

lines have a strong and broad variable component due to the continuum
fluorescence from a source (stellar atmosphere/optically thick wind) of

ionization, probably caused by wind density variation. The star presents
multiple periods in radial velocity and photometry. We derived, from our data,
a main radial velocity period of 0.3319 d with an amplitude of K = 58 km/s.
When at intermediate brightness level, this period is also seen in the
photometric measurements. When the star is at bright phase, the photometric
variations do not present the same period. Photometric periods ranging from
0.154 to 0.378 d are present, consistent with observations reported by other
authors. Besides the 0.3319 d period other spectroscopic periods are also seen.
On distinct epochs, the periods are different; Marchenko et al. (2000)
interpreted the 0.3319 d period as the orbital one. Although we do not discard
this possibility, the true binary nature (e.g. long term coherence or detection
of a secondary star) has not yet been demonstrated. DI Cru is a Population I WR

Coulomb blockade restricts the charge fluctuations in such a way that only zero

discuss its behavior. For large oscillation amplitude the probability of
transferring $\tilde n$ electrons per cycle is strongly peaked around one. The
peak is asymmetric since its form is controlled by different parameters for
$\tilde n>1$ and $\tilde n < 1$. Under certain conditions the systems behaves
as if the effective charge is 1/2 of the elementary one. Knowledge of the

a Josephson network feels the effect of random offset charges. We observe that
the Mott-insulating lobe structure of the phase diagram disappears for large

nearest-neighbor interactions, the insulating lobe around q=e is destroyed even

The Josephson coupling energy is calculated from the overlap of real space
Cooper pair wavefunctions in two superconductors through an insulating barrier.
It is shown that the Josephson tunneling is limited by the size of the Cooper
pair and its shrinking during the tunneling. Therefore, the Josephson coupling
energy and the critical current become extremely small in high $T_{c}$
superconductors, including $MgB_{2}$. This shrinking also causes the observed
DC supercurrent in low $T_{c}$ superconductors, such as Pb and Sn, to fall off
much faster than $1/R_{n}$ for tunneling resistance $R_{n}$ above several ohms.
Consequently there is a material-dependent threshold resistance, above which
the supercurrent decreases much faster with increasing resistance. The
impurity-induced shrinking is also shown to limit the critical current.
Furthermore, the (weak) temperature dependence of the Cooper pair size is found
to contribute to the temperature dependence of the DC supercurrent.

fluctuation phenomena are observed by a log(k_B T/(2 E_co)) reduction of the

approximate concrete models by gluing together indistinguishable states, namely
by a partition of the concrete state space. Strong preservation for a
specification language L encodes the equivalence of concrete and abstract model
checking of formulas in L. We show how abstract interpretation can be used to
design abstract models that are more general than abstract Kripke structures.
Accordingly, strong preservation is generalized to abstract
interpretation-based models and precisely related to the concept of
completeness in abstract interpretation. The problem of minimally refining an
abstract model in order to make it strongly preserving for some language L can
be formulated as a minimal domain refinement in abstract interpretation in
order to get completeness w.r.t. the logical/temporal operators of L. It turns
out that this refined strongly preserving abstract model always exists and can
be characterized as a greatest fixed point. As a consequence, some well-known
behavioural equivalences, like bisimulation, simulation and stuttering, and
their corresponding partition refinement algorithms can be elegantly
characterized in abstract interpretation as completeness properties and
refinements.

will be argued in the following that it is still possible to envision a program

justify a new collider operating at the phi-meson mass. It remains of paramount
importance that the program covers topics of fundamental interest, with many
collateral avenues well connected to the ultimate goal, a most sensitive test
of CPT invariance. The appropriate time frame for these ventures to be

the transition is quite strongly first order. We find that the topological

contrast, in the deconfined phase at larger N there are no topological
fluctuations except for rare, isolated and small instantons. This shows that as
N->infinity the large-T suppression of large instantons and the large-N

understanding deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero

to study generic properties of phase transitions using non-order parameter
fields without loosing the information encoded in the true order parameter.
{}For the pure gauge theory we demonstrate that, near the deconfining phase
transition, the center group symmetry is naturally linked to the conformal
anomaly. Another relevant outcome is that when the theory contains also quarks
we can explain the intertwining of chiral symmetry restoration and
deconfinement for QCD with matter fields either in the fundamental or in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group. As a test of our general approach we
show our results to be applicable also at non zero baryon chemical potential.
We also predict new testable substructures to be present in the phase diagram
of quarks in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. Here we provide
some new insights on the large $N$ limit of gauge theories by investigating the
hadronic world. We propose that the world of infinite $N$ should already be
well described when N=6 for QCD with two and three light flavors. Finally, we
suggest possible future applications of our results for heavy ions collisions.

three-dimensional generalized conifold, depending on the type of three-form
flux that is present. We describe the exactly marginal operators that
parameterize the fixed manifolds and find the operators which preserve the

that there are no dangerously irrelevant operators like Tr\Phi_i^{k+1}, k>2 in
the N=2 quiver gauge theories. The moduli space of the IR fixed point theory
generally contains orbifold singularities if W(\Phi_i) does not give a mass to
the adjoints. Finally we examine some nonconformal N=1 quiver theories. We find
evidence that the moduli space at the endpoint of a Seiberg duality cascade is
always a three-dimensional generalized conifold. In general, the low-energy
theory receives quantum corrections. In several non-cascading theories we find
that the moduli space is a generalized conifold realized as a monodromic

end (and usually, of infinite topology) which properly minimally embed into
Euclidean three-space. On such a surface, the set of ends forms a compact
Hausdorff space, naturally ordered by the relative heights of the ends in
space. One of our main results is that the middle ends of the surface have
quadratic area growth, and are thus not limit ends. This implies, for instance,
that the surface can have at most two limit ends (at the top and bottom of the
ordering), which is a strong topological restriction. There are also
restrictions on the asymptotic geometry and conformal structure of such a
surface: for example, we prove that if the surface has exactly two limit ends
(as do the classical Riemann Staircase examples), then it is recurrent (that
is, almost all Brownian paths are dense in the surface, and in particular any
positive harmonic function on the surface is constant). These results have
played an important role in the proof of several recent advances in the theory,

of constant width, up to 5 cm from the microwave coupler was recorded. Only
hydrogen, and not oxygen, showed significant line broadening. This feature,
observed previously in hydrogen-containing mixed gas plasmas generated with
high voltage dc and rf discharges was explained by some researchers to result
from acceleration of hydrogen ions near the cathode. This explanation cannot
apply to the line broadening observed in the (electrodeless) microwave plasmas
generated in this work, particularly at distances as great as 5 cm from the
microwave coupler. Second, inversion of the line intensities of both the Lyman
and Balmer series, again, at distances up to 5 cm from the coupler, were
observed. The line inversion suggests the existence of a hitherto unknown
source of pumping of the optical power in plasmas. Finally, it is notable that
other aspects of the plasma including the OH* rotational temperature and low
electron concentrations are quite typical of plasmas of this type.

admirable agreement between theory and experiment found previously for the
conservative model and justifying the conservative approximation in some cases.
We demonstrate that, while the optimal mutation rate for a conservative and
semi-conservative parasite interacting with a given immune system is similar to
that of a conservative parasite, the properties away from this optimum differ
significantly. We suspect that this difference, coupled with the requirement
that a parasite optimize survival in a range of viable hosts, may help explain
why semi-conservative viruses are known to have significantly lower mutation
rates than their conservative counterparts.
