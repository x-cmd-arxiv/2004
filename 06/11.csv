Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the extragalactic source B1849+005 at
frequencies between 0.33 and 15 GHz and the re-analysis of archival VLA
observations at 0.33, 1.5, and 4.9 GHz. The structure of this source is complex
but interstellar scattering dominates the structure of the central component at
least to 15 GHz. An analysis of the phase structure functions of the
interferometric visibilities shows the density fluctuations along this line of
sight to be anisotropic (axial ratio = 1.3) with a frequency-independent
position angle, and having an inner scale of roughly a few hundred kilometers.
The anisotropies occur on length scales of order 10^{15} cm (D/5 kpc), which
within the context of certain magnetohydrodynamic turbulence theories indicates
the length scale on which the kinetic and magnetic energy densities are
comparable. A conservative upper limit on the velocity of the scattering
material is 1800 km/s. In the 0.33 GHz field of view, there are a number of
other sources that might also be heavily scattered. Both B1849+005 and PSR
B1849+00 are highly scattered, and they are separated by only 13'. If the lines
of sight are affected by the same ``clump'' of scattering material, it must be
at least 2.3 kpc distant. However, a detailed attempt to account for the
scattering observables toward these sources does not produce a self-consistent
set of parameters for such a clump. A clump of H\alpha emission, possibly
associated with the H II region G33.418-0.004, lies between these two lines of
sight, but it seems unable to account for all of the required excess
scattering.

points in the position-position plot approximately follows the spiral arms
proposed by Taylor and Cordes (1993), the dispersion is still about as large as
the separation between their proposed arms. The longitude-velocity plot shows
an increase in the density of sources at the points where the spiral arm loci
proposed by Taylor and Cordes (1993) are approaching the locus of tangent point
velocities and a lower density between the arm loci. However, it is not
possible to trace spiral arms over significant segments of Galactic longitude

candidate H 1743-322 in X-rays simultaneously with Chandra and RXTE on four
occasions. The Chandra/HETGS spectra reveal narrow, variable (He-like) Fe XXV
and (H-like) Fe XXVI resonance absorption lines. In the first observation, the
Fe XXVI line has a FWHM of 1800 +/- 400 km/s and a blue-shift of 700 +/- 200
km/s, suggesting that the highly ionized medium is an outflow. Moreover, the Fe
XXV line is observed to vary significantly on a timescale of a few hundred
seconds in the first observation, which corresponds to the Keplerian orbital
period at approximately 1 E+4 gravitational radii. Our models for the
absorption geometry suggest that a combination of geometric effects and
changing ionizing flux are required to account for the large changes in line
flux observed between observations, and that the absorption likely occurs at a
radius less than 1 E+4 radii for a 10 Msun black hole. Viable models for the
absorption geometry include cyclic absorption due to an accretion disk
structure, absorption in a clumpy outflowing disk wind, or possibly a
combination of these two. If the wind in H 1743-322 has unity filling factor,
the highest implied mass outflow rate is 20 percent of the Eddington mass
accretion rate. This wind may be a hot precursor to the Seyfert-like,
outflowing ""warm absorber"" geometries recently found in the Galactic black

principles set forth elsewhere (Lupton et al 2004, PASP, 116, 133--137). The
principal difference between our RGB representation of the data and the more
traditional representation provided by the Space Telescope Science Institute is
that the (necessarily) nonlinear transformation between data values and RGB

way. For example, if one of the image pixel values saturates the dynamic range
of the RGB representation, all three of the R, G, and B values in the
representation are truncated such that the hue and saturation of the pixel is
the same as it would have been if the pixel had had lower flux but the same
astronomical color. This, in effect, makes the bright parts of the
representation an informative color map, not ""whited out"" as they are in
traditional representations. For the HUDF, this difference is seen best in the
centers of bright galaxies, which show significant detail not visible in the
more traditional representation.

can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity
correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to
be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing
distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing
shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the
tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby
galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant
galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic
alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to
the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as
suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a
gravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the
intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that
remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second
model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation.
In the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recently
claimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the GI correlation
term can exceed the usual II term by >1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic
correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. These interference effects
can suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by of
order ~10% at z_s=1 and ~30% at z_s=0.5.

amorphous and filamentary features correlate well with the known distributions
of denser gas, warm dust, and HII regions. There are also fainter, more diffuse
components at all wavelengths that permeate the entire region and extend into
the two tidal tails. Non-stellar dust emission dominates the 5.8 and 8.0 micron

traces star formation, the IRAC data provide a view into the total underlying
star forming activities unaffected by obscuration. Using the flux ratio of
non-stellar to stellar emission as a guide, we map the local star formation
rate in the Antennae and compare that to similar measurements in both normal

as high as those seen in starburst and some ultra-luminous infrared galaxies on
``per unit mass'' basis. The two galactic centers actually have lower star
forming rates than the off-nuclear regions despite the presence of abundant
dense gas and dust, suggesting that the latter is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for on-going star formation.

The formation of the HII region is characterized by initial slow expansion of a
weak D-type ionization front near the center, followed by rapid propagation of
an R-type front throughout the outer gas envelope. We find that the transition
between the two front types is indeed a critical condition for the complete
ionization of halos of cosmological interest. In small mass (< 10^6 M_sun)
halos, the transition takes place within a few 10^5 yr, yielding high escape
fractions (>80%) of both ionizing and photodissociating photons. In larger mass
(> 10^7 M_sun) halos, the ionization front remains to be of D-type over the
lifetime of the massive star, the HII region is confined well inside the virial
radius, and the escape fractions are essentially zero. We derive an analytic
formula that reproduces well the results of our simulations. We discuss

of the $r$-mode oscillations are obtained as functions of the ratio of the
rotational energy to the absolute value of the gravitational energy $T/|W|$
along sequences of polytropic equilibrium stars whose ratio of the pressure to
the total energy density at the center of the star and the polytropic index are
kept constant. It is found that the dimensionless oscillation frequency
$\sigma/\Omega$ is a linearly decreasing function of $T/|W|$, where $\sigma$
and $\Omega$ are the oscillation frequency and the angular velocity of the star
measured in an inertial frame at spatial infinity. We also find that
oscillation frequencies of the $r$-modes are highly dependent on the
relativistic factor $M/R$ of the star as already found in previous studies in
which the slow rotation approximation has been used. Here $M$ and $R$ denote
the mass and radius of the star, respectively.

conformally coupled particles, both for wavelengths much larger and much
smaller than the Hubble radius. For superhorizon modes we find that the decay
is of the form eta^{Gamma1} with eta being conformal time and we give an
explicit expression for Gamma1 to leading order in the coupling which has a
noteworthy interpretation in terms of the Hawking temperature of de Sitter
space-time. We show that if the mass M of the decaying field is << H then the
decay rate during inflation is enhanced over the Minkowski spacetime result by
a factor 2H/[pi M]. For wavelengths much smaller than the Hubble radius we find
that the decay law is e^{-alpha/[k H C(eta)} with C(eta) the scale factor and
alpha determined by the strength of the trilinear coupling. This result
suggests a suppression of power for long wavelength modes upon horizon
crossing. In all cases we find a substantial enhancement in the decay law as

of HCO+ are reminiscent of that of CO. In the integrated intensity map, we

constraints exist, we are able to reproduce between half and all of the ICM
iron. Due to the ubiquity of intracluster stars in clusters and their direct

applying simulation and analytic techniques to minimal hard core particle
(exclusion) models. The first model (I), for post-deposition coarsening
dynamics, contains mechanisms of diffusion, attachment, and slow activated
detachment (at rate epsilon<<1) of particles on a line. Simulation shows three
successive regimes of cluster growth: fast attachment of isolated particles;
detachment allowing further (epsilon t)^(1/3) coarsening of average cluster
size; and t^(-1/2) approach to a saturation size going like epsilon^(-1/2).
Model II generalizes the first one in having an additional mechanism of
particle deposition into cluster gaps, suppressed for the smallest gaps. This
model exhibits early rapid filling, leading to slowing deposition due to the
increasing scarcity of deposition sites, and then continued power law (epsilon
t)^(1/2) cluster size coarsening through the redistribution allowed by slow
detachment. The basic (epsilon t)^(1/3) domain growth laws and epsilon^(-1/2)
saturation in model I are explained by a simple scaling picture. A second,
fuller approach is presented which employs a mapping of cluster configurations
to a column picture and an approximate factorization of the cluster
configuration probability within the resulting master equation. This allows
quantitative results for the saturation of model I in excellent agreement with
the simulation results. For model II, it provides a one-variable scaling
function solution for the coarsening probability distribution, and in
particular quantitative agreement with the cluster length scaling and its
amplitude.

sidebands of the two ferromagnets. The electrons can pass through the barrier
easily under high frequencies but difficultly under low frequencies. The tunnel
magnetoresistance almost does not vary with an ac field. It is found that the
spin transfer torque, still being proportional to the electrical current under
an ac bias, can be changed by varying frequency. Low frequencies could yield a
rapid decrease of the spin transfer torque, while a large ac signal leads to
both decrease of the electrical current and the spin torque. If only an ac bias
is present, the spin transfer torque is sharply enhanced at the particular

must have larger triaxialities than theory predicts for their GW emission to be
detectable. However, assuming that their GW emission is detectable, we list the
pulsars for which timing noise is important, either because it is strong enough
that its neglect by the observer would render the source undetectable, or else
because it is a measurable feature of the GW signal. We also find that timing
noise places a limit on the observation duration of a coherent blind GW search,

such as particle masses - whose origins are still unknown and cannot be
predicted, but whose values are constrained through their interactions. In
particular, the masses of the top (t) quark (M_t) and W boson constrain the
mass of the long-hypothesized, but thus far not observed, Higgs boson. A
precise measurement of the top-quark mass can therefore point to where to look
for the Higgs, and indeed whether the hypothesis of a SM Higgs is consistent
with experimental data. Since top quarks are produced in pairs and decay in
only ~10^-24 s into various final states, reconstructing their mass from their
decay products is very challenging. Here we report a technique that extracts
far more information from each top-quark event and yields a greatly improved
precision on the top mass of 5.3 GeV/c^2, compared to previous measurements.
When our new result is combined with our published measurement in a
complementary decay mode and with the only other measurements available, the
new world average for M_t becomes 178.0 +- 4.3 GeV/c^2. As a result, the most
likely Higgs mass increases from the experimentally excluded value of 96
GeV/c^2 to 117 GeV/c^2, which is beyond current experimental sensitivity. The
upper limit on the Higgs mass at 95% confidence level is raised from 219

minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model imposes an upper bound on the universal
gaugino mass $m_{1/2}$ as function of the common scalar mass $m_0$. Combining
this with the experimental lower bound on $m_{1/2}$ from LEP data, we find a
new lower bound on $m_0$, stronger than the one that comes from experimental
data alone. If the corresponding upper and lower limits on the superparticle
masses, presented in this letter, are found to be violated at Tevatron Run II
or at the LHC, it would imply that we are living on a false vacuum. Special
attention has been paid in estimating the uncertainties in these predictions
due to the choice of the renormalization scale. The implications of our limits
for the constraints obtained by indirect methods(SUSY dark matter, g - 2 of the
muon, $ b \to s \gamma$....) are briefly discussed.

changes from a virtual state to a bound state of pion-pion as the temperature
increases which causes the enhancement at the pion-pion threshold. The behavior
is understood as the emergence of the pion-pion bound state due to the
enhancement of the pion-pion attraction by the induced emission in medium. The
latter pole, not the former, eventually degenerates with pion above the

vacuum energy (cosmological constant) dominate in the flat Universe. Thus the
direct dark matter detection, consisting of detecting the recoiling nucleus, is
central to particle physics and cosmology. Supersymmetry provides a natural
dark matter candidate, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The relevant
cross sections arise out of two mechanisms: i) The coherent mode, due to the
scalar interaction and ii) The spin contribution arising from the axial
current. In this paper we will focus on the spin contribution, which is
expected to dominate for light targets.
  For both modes it is possible to obtain detectable rates, but in most models
the expected rates are much lower than the present experimental goals. So one
should exploit two characteristic signatures of the reaction, namely the
modulation effect and, in directional experiments, the correlation of the event
rates with the sun's motion.
  In standard non directional experiments the modulation is small, less than
two per cent. In the case of the directional event rates we like to suggest
that the experiments exploit two features, of the process, which are
essentially independent of the SUSY model employed, namely: 1) The
forward-backward asymmetry, with respect to the sun's direction of motion, is
very large and 2) The modulation is much larger, especially if the observation
is made in a plane perpendicular to the sun's velocity. In this case the
difference between maximum and minimum can be larger than 40 per cent and the
phase of the Earth at the maximum is direction dependent.

then to requiring the solution of a free-particle Schr\""{o}dinger equation

particular we do not impose the determinant class condition. The resulting
torsions are elements of the determinant line of the extended L^2 cohomology.
Under the determinant class assumption the L^2 torsions of this paper
specialize to the invariants studied in our previous work. Applying a recent
theorem of D. Burghelea, L. Friedlander and T. Kappeler we obtain a Cheeger -
Muller type theorem stating the equality between the combinatorial and the
analytic L^2 torsions.

  Archive Edition (Replaces Abridged Version)",,,,"math.AP",,"  This dissertation resolves a longstanding discussion of a mathematical
problem important in contaminant hydrogeology and chemical-reaction
engineering, the proper mathematical description for a miscible solute
undergoing longitudinal convective-dispersive transport with production, decay,
and sorption in a porous medium. Initial and input concentrations may be any
continuously differentiable functions and the problem is stated for a finite
domain. This domain yields a mass balance which requires Robin (i.e.,
third-type) boundaries, which describe a continuous flux but a discontinuous
resident-concentration. The discontinuity in the resident concentration at the
outflow boundary yields an underdetermined system when the exit concentration
is not experimentally measured. This is resolved by defining the unknown
effluent concentration from a semi-infinite problem which satisfies a Dirichlet
(i.e., first-type) condition at the origin. The solution is represented in a
uniformly convergent series of real variables.
  The large volume of antecedent literature on finite solutions for
convective-dispersive transport equations grew out of the historical precedents
set by Danckwerts (1953) and Wehner and Wilhelm (1956) whom made simplifying
assumptions of continuous boundary concentrations. This dissertation includes
the demonstration that continuous-concentration hypotheses, whether rendered as
Dirichlet or homogeneous Neumann (i.e., second-type) conditions, satisfy
external mass conservation yet fail to provide solutions that are internally
consistent with the governing equation.

propose to enable VT to asymptotically fix the true values of the parameters as
does the EM algorithm. This relies on infinite Viterbi alignment and an
associated with it limiting probability distribution. This paper, however,
focuses on mixture models, an important case of HMM, wherein the limiting
distribution can always be computed exactly; finding such limiting distribution
for general HMM presents a more challenging task under our ongoing
investigation.
  A simulation of a univariate Gaussian mixture shows that our central

by simulation its fast convergence and high accuracy; its computational

Furthermore, a careful derivation of the usual equations of integrated
photoelasticity in terms of heuristic length scales of the material
inhomogeneity and anisotropy is provided, making the paper a self-contained
account about the reconstruction of arbitrary three-dimensional, weakly
anisotropic dielectric tensor fields.

for the period 1961 - 2001 are summarized. An exponential decline of
radioactivity followed the moratorium on atmospheric nuclear testing. The
highest activity of Sr-90 deposited by fallout, being 1060 Bq/m2, was recorded
in 1963, while the peak Sr-90 activity concentration in milk, 1.42 +/-0.17
Bq/L, was recorded in 1964. The values in year 2001 for fallout deposition and
milk were 7.7 Bq/m2 and 0.07 +/- 0.03 Bq/L, respectively. The reactor accident
at Chernobyl caused higher Sr-90 levels only in 1986. Sr-90 fallout activity
affects milk activity, the coefficient of correlation between Sr-90 fallout
activity and Sr-90 activity concentrations in milk being 0.80. The transfer
coefficient from fallout deposition to milk was estimated to be 2.5 mBqy/L per
Bq/m2. The dose incurred by milk consumption was estimated for the Croatian
population, the annual collective effective dose in 2001 being approximately
2.0 man-Sv.

difficult problem, because environmental noise increases in this frequency
domain and it is very difficult to filter it efficiently. In order to
counteract these major problems, we propose a simple and generic denoising
technique, which mixes several features of traditional feedback techniques and
those of noise estimators. As an example of application, large band
measurements of the thermal fluctuations of a mechanical oscillator are
presented. These measurements show that the proposed denoising technique is
easy to implement and gives good results.

to analyze the dynamical relationship between community and metacommunity
species distributions as a test of the neutral theory of biodiversity and
biogeography. At the community scale, observed variation in species richness
and relative abundance was greater than predicted by neutral models, and
revealed important differences among species in competitive ability and
tolerance for predation. At the metacommunity scale, species with metacommunity
proportions of less than 0.01% (38% of the observed metacommunity) were
consistently more abundant than predicted by models. Our results are at
variance with the neutral theory, and suggest that the use of an identical
survival probability for all species in neutral models misrepresents
substantial aspects of community assembly. Nevertheless, building and testing
neutral models can provide valuable insights into the processes that determine
species distributions.

introduce the concept of reduced redundancy in a dependent set of projective

constant value exponentially fast as the size of the subsystem increases.
Actually we proved that the density matrix of the continuous block of spins

[distance to the ends also not essential]. We also study reduced density
matrices of two spins both in the bulk and on the boundary. We evaluated
