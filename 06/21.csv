standard model energy densities. Under the circumstance that this modification
cannot be limited to the addition of a mere cosmological constant, a serious
situation has emerged in cosmology, in which the energy densities in the
universe have become largely speculative. In this situation, an equation of
state of the form p=w \rho itself is not well-motivated. In this paper, we
argue that the reasonable option left is to make a model-independent analysis
of SNe data, without reference to the energy densities. In this basically
kinematic approach, we limit ourselves to the observationally justifiable
assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy; i.e., to the assumption that the
universe has a RW metric. This cosmographic approach is historically the
original one to cosmology. We perform the analysis by expanding the scale
factor into a polynomial of order 5, which assumption can be further
generalised to any order. The present expansion rates h, q_0, r_0 etc. are
evaluated by computing the marginal likelihoods for these parameters. These
values are relevant, since any cosmological solution would ultimately need to
explain them.

hole that is most likely caused by a newly formed planet. Assuming that the
planet opened a gap in the viscous disk, we estimate that the planet mass is
greater than 0.1 Jupiter masses. This estimate depends on a lower limit to the
disk viscosity derived from the time scale needed to accrete the inner disk,
creating the now detectable hole. The planet migration time scale must at least
modestly exceed the time for the spectrally inferred hole to clear. The
proximity of the planet to the disk edge implied by our limits suggests that
the latter is perturbed by the nearby planet and may exhibit a spiral pattern
rotating with the planet. This pattern might be resolved with current ground
based mid-infrared cameras and optical cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope.
The required sub-Myr planet formation may challenge core accretion formation
models. However, we find that only if the planet mass is larger than about 10
Jupiter masses, allowing for a high enough surface density without inducing
migration, would formation by direct gravitational instability be possible.

signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution permit a detailed examination of
the feature profile, something which has rarely been attempted in extragalactic
lines of sight. The 3.4 micron band in these galaxies closely resembles that
seen in the Galactic diffuse ISM and in newly-formed dust in a protoplanetary
nebula. The similarity implies a common carrier for the carbonaceous component
of dust, and one which is resistant to processing in the interstellar and/or
circumnuclear medium. We also examine the mid-IR spectrum of NGC1068, because
absorption bands in the 5-8 micron region further constrain the chemistry of
the 3.4 micron band carrier. While weak features like those present in the
mid-IR spectrum of diffuse dust towards the Galactic center would be
undetectable in NGC1068, the strong bands found in the spectra of many proposed
dust analog materials are clearly absent, eliminating certain candidates and
production mechanisms for the carrier. The absence of strong absorption
features at 5-8 microns is also consistent with the interpretation that the
similarity in the 3.4 micron feature in NGC1068 to that in Galactic lines of

object. This spectrum, the first to be taken after a hiatus of nearly 10 years

exceptionally strong emission in the resonance doublet of KI at 7665 and

pervasive emission of the 1.809 MeV gamma ray photon, arising from the decay of
26Al to 26Mg, from all over the galactic plane. Though the sites from where
this emission originates are not clearly established, novae are believed to be
an important contributing source. In this context, V4332 Sgr presented a rare
opportunity to observationally investigate whether novae or novae-like sources
synthesize 26Al and to what extent. Strong AlO bands in the near-IR have been
reported in this object recently. As molecular bands of different isotopic
compositions are readily resolved spectroscopically (e.g. 12CO and 13CO), it
was thought that the components of AlO associated with
  26Al and stable 27Al could be detected as separate bands. Our spectra
indicate that there is no strong presence of 26Al in V4332 Sgr. A reliable
upper limit of 0.10 for the 26Al/27Al ratio is determined which constitutes the
first observational constraint for this ratio in a potential 26Al producing
source. While V4332 Sgr is not a typical nova, its outburst amplitude and
light-curve behaviour bear close similarity to that of novae. Hence, although
the results from V4332 Sgr cannot be directly extended to novae in general, the
limit on the observed 26Al/27Al ratio could be a useful input in constraining
rather uncertain nucleosynthesis models for the production of 26Al in
novae/novae-like sources. By comparing the observed 26Al/27Al ratio in V4332
Sgr with that expected in classical novae it appears unlikely that the
progenitor of V4332 Sgr is an Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium white dwarf.

nebulae (PNe) in the Local Group spiral galaxy M33. We use our sample of 152
PNe to derive an [O III] planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) distance
of (m-M)_0 = 24.86^+0.07-0.11 (0.94^+0.03-0.05 Mpc). Although this value is ~
15% larger than the galaxy's Cepheid distance, the discrepancy likely arises
from differing assumptions about the system's internal extinction. Our
photometry (which extends >3 mag down the PNLF), also reveals that the
faint-end of M33's PN luminosity function is non-monotonic, with an inflection
point ~2 mag below the PNLF cutoff. We argue that this feature is due to the
galaxy's large population of high core-mass planetaries, and that its amplitude
may eventually be useful as a diagnostic for studies of stellar populations.
  Fiber-coupled spectroscopy of 140 of the PN candidates confirms that M33's PN
population rotates along with the old disk, with a small asymmetric drift of \~

that this is due to a combination of factors, including a decline in the radial
component of the velocity ellipsoid at small galactocentric radii, and a
gradient in the ratio of the vertical to radial velocity dispersion. We use our
data to show that the mass scale length of M33's disk is ~2.3 times larger than
that of the system's IR luminosity and that the disk's V-band mass-to-light
ratio changes from M/L_V ~0.3 in the galaxy's inner regions to M/L_V ~2.0 at ~9

superior to the conventional approaches such as X-ray hardness ratio or X-ray
color analysis to study relatively faint sources or to investigate a certain
phase or state of a source in detail, where poor statistics does not allow
spectral fitting using a model. Instead of working with predetermined energy
bands, we determine the energy values that divide the detected photons into
predetermined fractions of the total counts such as median (50%), tercile (33%
& 67%), and quartile (25% & 75%). We use these quantiles as an indicator of the
X-ray hardness or color of the source. We show that the median is an improved
substitute for the conventional X-ray hardness ratio. The median and other
quantiles form a phase space, similar to the conventional X-ray color-color
diagrams. The quantile-based phase space is more evenly sensitive over various
spectral shapes than the conventional color-color diagrams, and it is naturally
arranged to properly represent the statistical similarity of various spectral
shapes. We demonstrate the new technique in the 0.3-8 keV energy range using
Chandra ACIS-S detector response function and a typical aperture photometry
involving background subtraction. The technique can be applied in any energy
band, provided the energy distribution of photons can be obtained.

  Programming","15 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.AI",,"  We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very
important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article -
the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has
so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional
matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of
the so-called bitboard format.
  The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using
variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree
expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more
efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions
with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine
language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The
routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in
its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo,
based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000
games altogether).

weak-field warp drive, testing the energy conditions to first and second order
of the non-relativistic warp-bubble velocity. We are primarily interested in a
secondary feature of the warp drive that has not previously been remarked upon,
if it could be built, the warp drive would be an example of a ""reaction-less
drive"". For both the Alcubierre and Natario warp drives we find that the
occurrence of significant energy condition violations is not just a high-speed
effect, but that the violations persist even at arbitrarily low speeds.
  An interesting feature of this construction is that it is now meaningful to
place a finite mass spaceship at the center of the warp bubble, and compare the
warp field energy with the mass-energy of the spaceship. There is no hope of
doing this in Alcubierre's original version of the warp-field, since by
definition the point in the center of the warp bubble moves on a geodesic and
is ""massless"". That is, in Alcubierre's original formalism and in the Natario
formalism the spaceship is always treated as a test particle, while in the
linearized theory we can treat the spaceship as a finite mass object. For both
the Alcubierre and Natario warp drives we find that even at low speeds the net
(negative) energy stored in the warp fields must be a significant fraction of
the mass of the spaceship.

Higgs boson masses and other MSSM parameters are obtained for a number of

range of values for mh at each tan beta, and for a top quark mass of 174.3 GeV,
the domain 0.7<tan beta<1.9 is excluded at the 95% confidence level and Higgs
boson mass limits of mh>84.5 GeV and ma>85.0 GeV are obtained. For the
CP-violating benchmark scenario CPX which, by construction, enhances the
CP-violating effects in the Higgs sector, the domain tan beta<2.8 is excluded
but no universal limit can be set on the Higgs boson masses.

ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 GeV is achievable on the Higgs boson mass. The
topological cross section \sigma(e+e- -> HA -> bbbb) can be determined with the

and the T-modulus go to the potential-free solutions at late time, while the
moving brane tries to avoid colliding with the boundary and stabilize within
the bulk. When the fluid is included, we find that the real parts of the fields
track its behaviour and that the moving brane gets stabilized at the middle
point between the boundaries. In this latter case we can make analytic
approximations for the evolution of the fields whether or not axions are
included and we consider the possibility of this set up being a realization of
the quintessential scenario.

leads to well behaved spectral densities of open strings due to the existence
of non-trivial damping factors of energy. We further study the cylinder

oriented affine lines in ${\Bbb{R}}^3$ to describe reflection of rays off a
surface. This allows the quantities in the optical approximation to the Casimir
effect to be calculated.
  To illustrate this we determine explicitly and in closed form the geometric
optics approximation of the Casimir force between two non-parallel plates. By
making one of the plates finite we regularise the divergence that is caused by
the intersection of the planes. In the parallel plate limit we prove that our
expression reduces to Casimir's original result.

allows communicating parties to securely establish cryptographic keys. It is a
well-established fact that all QKE protocols require that the parties have
access to an authentic channel. Without this authenticated link, QKE is
vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Overlooking this fact results in
exaggerated claims and/or false expectations about the potential impact of QKE.
In this paper we present a systematic comparison of QKE with traditional key
establishment protocols in realistic secure communication systems.

states, entangled in polarization and momentum. These states are produced by a
high brilliance parametric source of entangled photon pairs with peculiar
characteristics of flexibility in terms of state generation. The quality of the
entanglement in the two degrees of freedom has been tested by multimode
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry.
