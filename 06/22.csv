The relative abundances resemble the dust depletion patterns in the Milky Way,
from which we infer a visual extinction of A_V=0.4 and A_V>0.3 at 95%
confidence level. However, the high columns of metals and dust contrast with an
observed UV continuum spectrum that is remarkably close to a power law of the
form F_nu \propto nu^{-0.9}, with no sign of curvature, or a 2200 A extinction
feature, suggesting low reddening. The Milky Way or Magellanic Cloud reddenings
are possible only for very low visual extinctions (A_V<0.08 or A_V<0.2,
respectively at 95% confidence), inconsistent with the A_V values inferred from
the depletion analysis. If we assume a GRB intrinsic spectrum and an extinction
law of the forms F_lambda^i = F_V (5500/lambda)^alpha and A_lambda= A_V
(5500/lambda)^gamma, we obtain (for A_V=0.4) the constraints from continuum

Sloan r' band clearly shows a periodic, sinusoidal modulation at 18.2+-0.1 min
with a fractional semiamplitude of 8%, which we identify as the binary period.
This is the second shortest orbital period among all the known LMXBs, and it
verifies the earlier suggestion of 4U 1543-624 as an ultracompact binary based
on X-ray spectroscopic properties. The sinusoidal shape of the optical
modulation suggests that it arises from X-ray heating of the mass donor in a
relatively low-inclination binary, although it could also be a superhump
oscillation in which case the orbital period is slightly shorter. If the donor
is a C-O white dwarf as previously suggested, its likely mass and radius are
around 0.03 M_sun and 0.03 R_sun, respectively. For conservative mass transfer
onto a neutron star and driven by gravitational radiation, this implies an
X-ray luminosity of 6.5X10^36 erg/s and a source distance of 7 kpc. We also
discuss optical photometry of another LMXB, the candidate ultracompact binary
4U 1822-000. We detected significant optical variability on a time scale of
about 90 min, but it is not yet clear whether this was due to a periodic

and 82.2% respectively. It was recently prompted by the availability of a
2088-day-long time series of spherical harmonic coefficients produced by the
MDI team.
  The fitting procedure uses an optimal sine-multi-taper spectral estimator --
whith the number of tapers based on the mode linewidth, the complete leakage
matrix (i.e., horizontal as well as vertical components), and an asymmetric
mode profile to fit simultaneously all the azimuthal orders with individually
parametrized profiles.
  This method was applied to 2088-day-long time series of MDI and GONG
observations, as well as 728-day-long subsets, and for spherical harmonic
degrees between 1 and 25. The values resulting from these fits are
inter-compared (MDI versus GONG) and compared to equivalent estimates from the
MDI team and the GONG project. I also compare the results from fitting the
728-day-long subsets to the result of the 2088-day-long time series. This
comparison shows the well known change of frequencies with solar activity --
and how it scales with a nearly constant pattern in frequency and m/l. This
comparison also shows some changes in the mode linewidth and the constancy of
the mode asymmetry.

II LMC survey and the star cluster catalogues. The observed distribution of
stellar density on the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were compared with the
synthetic ones generated from the stellar evolutionary models. By minimising
the reduced chi-square values, the star formation history of the regions were
obtained in terms of the star formation rates (SFRs). All the regions were
found to show large SFRs between the ages 500 Myr - 2 Gyr with lower values for
younger and older ages. The correlated peak in the cluster and SFRs is found
for ages $sim$ 1 Gyr, and for ages less than 100 Myr. Five out of six regions
show significant cluster formation in the 100 - 300 Myr, while the SFRs were
found to be very low. This indicates anti-correlation between star and cluster
formation rates for the 100 - 300 Myr age range. A possible reason may be that
the stars are predominantly formed in clusters, whether bound or unbound, as a
result of star formation during the above age range. The enhanced cluster
formation rate at 100 - 300 Myr age range could be correlated with the
encounter of LMC with the Small Magellanic Cloud, while the enhanced star and
cluster formation at $\sim$ 1 Gyr does not correspond to any interaction. This
could indicate that the star formation induced by interaction is biased towards
group or cluster formation of stars.

distant (z=0.36) galaxy cluster found in the Bright SHARC catalog. The

substructure in the west. Despite the indication of interaction we do not find
any sign of temperature gradients. Due to the non-symmetric form of the main
cluster we extract surface brightness profiles in different sectors around its
centre. We see large variations between the profiles, which we quantify by
beta-model fitting. The corresponding r_c's vary between 0.1-0.5Mpc and the
beta's between 0.5-1.2. The variations of the beta-model parameters indicate
that the main cluster is not entirely relaxed. This hypothesis is strengthened
by the fact that the cluster is over-luminous with respect to the (z-evolving)
L_x-T relation found for nearby clusters. Comparing our profiles to the
reference emission measure profile of Arnaud et al., we find that only the
profile extracted north-east (NE) of the main cluster centre is similar to this
reference profile. This indicates that only the NE profile is representative
for the relaxed part of this cluster component. Using this profile and the
spectroscopically fitted temperature of T=4.9^+0.5_-0.4keV we find M_500~4
10^14 solar masses. This value is in agreement with the value obtained using
the z-evolving M_500-T relation from the HIFLUGCS sample. For the gas mass
fraction we find f_g~18-20% which is in good agreement with other work. We also
develop a simple on-axis merger model for the cluster. Together with a simple
ram pressure model we find that the most likely physical distance of the

understand the effects of clumping on molecular line profiles and ratios, for
example how clumping effects the interpretation of 13CO(1-0) to 12CO(1-0) line
ratios. It can also be used as a propagation operator in physical models of
clumpy media where the incident radiation effects the spectral line emissivity.

bands variations. We confirmed this result and estimated the delay amounts with
a cross--correlation analysis performed on the single flares, discussing also
variability patterns that could reproduce the asymmetry seen in the
cross-correlation function. We verified our findings reproducing the two flares
with analytical models. We obtained consistent results: during one flare, Mkn
421 displayed soft lags, while in the other case it showed hard lags. In both
cases, the entity of the delays increases with the energy difference between
the compared light curves. Finally, we discussed the presence and the frequency
dependence of the temporal lags as an effect of particle acceleration, cooling
and escape timescales, showing that our data are consistent with this picture.

  Journal",,"10.1086/424385",,"astro-ph",,"  Based on the photometry of 10 near-UV, optical, and near-infrared bands of
the Chandra Deep Field South, we estimate the photometric redshifts for 342
X-ray sources, which constitute ~99% of all the detected X-ray sources in the
field. The models of spectral energy distribution are based on galaxies and a
combination of power-law continuum and emission lines. Color information is
useful for source classifications: Type-I AGN show non-thermal spectral
features that are distinctive from galaxies and Type-II AGN. The hardness ratio
in X-ray and the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio are also useful discriminators.
Using rudimentary color separation techniques, we are able to further refine
our photometric redshift estimations. Among these sources, 137 have reliable
spectroscopic redshifts, which we use to verify the accuracy of photometric
redshifts and to modify the model inputs. The average relative dispersion in
redshift distribution is ~8%, among the most accurate for photometric surveys.
The high reliability of our results is attributable to the high quality and
broad coverage of data as well as the applications of several independent
methods and a careful evaluation of every source. We apply our redshift
estimations to study the effect of redshift on broadband colors and to study
the redshift distribution of AGN. Our results show that both the hardness ratio
and U-K color decline with redshift, which may be the result of a K-correction.
The number of Type-II AGN declines significantly at z>2 and that of galaxies
declines at z>1. However, the distribution of Type-I AGN exhibits less redshift
dependence. As well, we observe a significant peak in the redshift distribution
at z=0.6. We demonstrate that our photometric redshift estimation produces a
reliable database for the study of X-ray luminosity of galaxies and AGN.

and different IMF slopes are tested. In most of the explored cases, a galactic
wind develops, mostly carrying out of the galaxy the metal-enriched gas
produced by the burst itself. The chemical species with the largest escape
probabilities are Fe and N. Consequently, we predict that the [$\alpha$/Fe] and
[$\alpha$/N] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside. In order to
reproduce the chemical composition of IZw18, the best choice seems to be the
adoption of the yields of Meynet & Maeder (2002) which take into account
stellar rotation, although these authors do not follow the whole evolution of
all the stars. Models with a flat IMF (x=0.5) seem to be able to better
reproduce the chemical properties of IZw18, but they inject in the gas a much
larger amount of energy and the resulting galactic wind is very strong, at

sources in the 0.5-10 keV band are in the range of log LX ~30-32 ergs s-1,
which is systematically higher than those of low-mass PMSs. This fact suggests
that the contribution of a possible low-mass companion is not large. Most of
the bright sources show significant time variation, particularly, two HAeBes -
MWC 297 and TY CrA - exhibit flare-like events with long decay timescales
(e-folding time ~ 10-60 ksec). These flare shapes are similar to those of
low-mass PMSs. The X-ray spectra are successfully reproduced by an absorbed one
or two-temperature thin-thermal plasma model. The temperatures are in the range
of kT ~1-5 keV, which are significantly higher than those of main-sequence OB
stars (kT < 1 keV). These X-ray properties are not explained by wind driven
shocks, but are more likely due to magnetic activity. On the other hand, the
plasma temperature rises as absorption column density increases, or as HAeBes
ascend to earlier phases. The X-ray luminosity reduces after stellar age of a
few x10^6 years. X-ray activity may be related to stellar evolution. The age of
the activity decay is apparently near the termination of jet or outflow
activity. We thus hypothesize that magnetic activity originates from the
interaction of the large scale magnetic fields coupled to the circumstellar
disk. We also discuss differences in X-ray properties between HAeBes and

behavior of the force in the critical region is derived and its asymptotics are
investigated. While in the critical and under critical region the force is of
the order of $L^{-d}$, for $T>T_c$ it decays as $L^{-d-\sigma}$, where $L$ is
the thickness of the film. We consider both the case of a finite system that

$d-1>\sigma$, when one observes a dimensional crossover from $d$ to a $d-1$
dimensional critical behavior. The behavior of the force along the phase
coexistence line for a magnetic field H=0 and $T<T_c$ is also derived. We have
proven analytically that the excess free energy is always negative and
monotonically increasing function of $T$ and $H$. For the Casimir force we have
demonstrated that for any $\sigma \ge 1$ it is everywhere negative, i.e. an
attraction between the surfaces bounding the system is to be observed. At

Based on the effective field theory, we find that the bosonic spinons are
deconfined to emerge at the quantum critical point of the nonlinear $\sigma$
model. It is emphasized that the deconfinement of spinons is realized {\it in
the absence of Berry phase}. This is in contrast to the previous study of
Senthil et al. [Science {\bf 303}, 1490 (2004)], where the Berry phase plays a
crucial role, resulting in the deconfinement of spinons. It is the reason why
the deconfinement is obtained even in the absence of the Berry phase effect
that the quantum critical point is described by the XY (""neutral"") fixed point,
not the IXY (""charged"") fixed point. The IXY fixed point is shown to be
unstable against instanton excitations and the instanton excitations are
proliferated. {\it At the IXY fixed point it is the Berry phase effect that
suppresses the instanton excitations, causing the deconfinement of spinons}.
{\it On the other hand, the XY fixed point is found to be stable against
instanton excitations because an effective internal charge is zero at the
neutral XY fixed point}. As a result the deconfinement of spinons occurs at the
quantum critical point of the O(3) nonlinear $\sigma$ model in two dimensions.

facilitates applications of the SIC to alloys and pseudoalloys which could
describe disordered local moment systems, as well as intermediate valences. As
a demonstration of the method, we study the well-known $\alpha$-$\gamma$ phase
transition in Ce, where we also explain how SIC operates in terms of multiple
scattering theory.

described by a network of coupled oscillators. We use such a description for an
incompressible fluid to study the development of the r-mode instability of
rotating neutron stars. A previous hydrodynamical simulation of the r-mode
reported the catastrophic decay of large amplitude r-modes. We explain the
dynamics and timescale of this decay analytically by means of a single three
mode coupling. We argue that at realistic driving and damping rates such large
amplitudes will never actually be reached. By numerically integrating a network
of nearly 5000 coupled modes, we find that the linear growth of the r-mode
ceases before it reaches an amplitude of around 10^(-4). The lowest parametric
instability thresholds for the r-mode are calculated and it is found that the
r-mode becomes unstable to modes with 13<n<15 if modes up to n=30 are included.
Using the network of coupled oscillators, integration times of 10^6 rotational
periods are attainable for realistic values of driving and damping rates.
Complicated dynamics of the modal amplitudes are observed. The initial
development is governed by the three mode coupling with the lowest parametric
instability. Subsequently a large number of modes are excited, which greatly
decreases the linear growth rate of the r-mode.

Pierri for Einstein-Rosen waves and its perturbative counterpart based on the
concept of particle that arises in linearized gravity with a de Donder gauge.
We show that the gauge adopted by Ashtekar and Pierri is a generalization of
the de Donder gauge to full (i.e. non-linearized) cylindrical gravity. This
fact allows us to relate the two descriptions of the Einstein-Rosen waves
analyzed here by means of a simple field redefinition. Employing this
redefinition, we find the highly non-linear relation that exists between the
annihilation and creation-like variables of the two approaches. We next
represent the particle-like variables of the perturbative approach as
regularized operators, introducing a cut-off. These can be expanded in powers
of the annihilation and creation operators of the Ashtekar and Pierri
quantization, each additional power being multiplied by an extra square-root of
the three-dimensional gravitational constant, $\sqrt{G}$. In principle, the
perturbative vacuum may be reached as the limit of a state annihilated by these
regularized operators when the cut-off is removed. This state can be written as
the vacuum of the Ashtekar and Pierri quantization corrected by a perturbative
series in $\sqrt{G}$ with no contributions from particles with energies above
the cut-off. We show that the first-order correction is in fact a state of
infinite norm. This result is interpreted as indicating that the Fock
quantizations in the two approaches are unitarily inequivalent and, in any
case, proves that the perturbative vacuum is not analytic in the interaction
constant. Therefore a standard perturbative quantum analysis fails.

generalization of methods originally applied to chiral soliton models in the

and width degeneracies among resonances of various quantum numbers.
Phenomenological evidence demonstrates that patterns of resonant decay

orders in 1/N_c, where again agreement with data is evident.

incorporating the effects of quark confinement and OZI-allowed decay in a fully
nonperturbative way. Results for resonances and bound states are compared to
experiment, on the basis of computed pole positions and cross sections. New
predictions for open-charm and -bottom scalar mesons are presented.
  Concretely, observed vector states for u-ubar/d-dbar, s-sbar, c-cbar, and
b-bbar are reproduced, and others are predicted. In the light scalar sector,
the now established two nonets, one below 1 GeV and one in the region 1.3 - 1.5
GeV, are easily described, through the appearance of extra poles in the
scattering matrix. The recently found Ds0*(2317) meson is accurately reproduced
by the same mechanism, as a quasi-bound state in the coupled c-sbar/DK system.

5.47(+-0.05) GeV with a width of about 50 MeV. Additional predictions concern

confirms previous non-relativistic results, showing that the shape of the cross

interaction alone. As for the region away from threshold, the relativistic pion
exchange contribution is seen to dominate the other mechanisms of the reaction.

description of a decohering quantum system. Under these conditions approximate
techniques to simplify a multileveled system by its first two levels is
unreliable and a realistic multilevel description in the formulation of
decoherence is unavoidable. In this regard, our first crucial observation is
that, the validity of the two level approximation of a multileveled system is
not controlled purely by {\it sufficiently low temperatures}. We demonstrate
using three different environmental spectral models that the type of
system-environment coupling and the environmental spectrum have a dominant role
over the temperature. Particularly, zero temperature quantum fluctuations
induced by the Caldeira-Leggett type linear coordinate coupling can be
influential in a wide energy range in the systems allowed transitions. The
second crucial observation against the validity of the two level approximation
is that the decoherence times being among the system's short time scales are
found to be dominated not by the resonant but {\it non-resonant} processes. We
demonstrate this in three stages. Firstly, our zero temperature numerical
calculations reveal that, the calculated decoherence rates including
relaxation, dephasing and leakage phenomena show, a linear dependence on the
spectral area for all spectral models used, independent from the spectral shape
within a large environmental spectral range compared to the quantum system's
energies. Secondly, within the same range, the decoherence times only have a
marginal dependence on the translations of the entire frequency spectrum.
Finally, the same decoherence rates show strong dependence on the number of
coupled levels by the system-environment coupling.

the coherent structure of the system ground state. The entanglement of the
