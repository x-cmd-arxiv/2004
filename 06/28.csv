redshift of z=2.2 that are faint at both submmillimeter (submm) and optical
wavelengths. While the radio fluxes of these galaxies could indicate
far-infrared (far-IR) luminosities comparable to high-redshift
submillimeter-selected galaxies (>10^12 Lsun), none are detected in the submm.
We propose that this new population of galaxies represents an extension of the
high-redshift submm galaxy population, but with hotter characteristic dust
temperatures that shift the peak of their far-IR emission to shorter
wavelengths, reducing the submm flux below the sensitivity of current
instruments. Therefore, surveys in the submm waveband may miss up to half of
the most luminous, dusty galaxies at z~2. Mid-infrared observations with
Spitzer will be a powerful tool to test this hypothesis.

confronted with the first year WMAP, 2dF galaxy survey and latest SN-Ia data.
Despite the huge freedom in dark energy dynamics there are no new degeneracies
with standard cosmic parameters apart from a mild degeneracy between
reionisation and the redshift of acceleration, both of which effectively
suppress small scale power. Breaking this degeneracy will help significantly in
detecting dynamics, if it exists. Our best-fit model to the data has
significant late-time evolution at z<1.5. Phantom models are also considered
and we find that the best-fit crosses w=-1 which, if confirmed, would be a
clear signal for radically new physics. Treatment of such rapidly varying
models requires careful integration of the dark energy density usually not
implemented in standard codes, leading to crucial errors of up to 5%.
Nevertheless cosmic variance means that standard LCDM models are still a very
good fit to the data and evidence for dynamics is currently very weak.
Independent tests of reionisation or the epoch of acceleration (e.g. ISW-LSS
correlations) or reduction of cosmic variance at large scales (e.g. cluster
polarisation at high redshift) may prove key in the hunt for dynamics.

(z=0.183) are investigated, based on deep high resolution ACS images. A UCD
candidate has to be unresolved, have i<28 (M_V<-11.5) mag and satisfy color
limits derived from Bayesian photometric redshifts. We find 160 UCD candidates
with 22<i<28 mag. It is estimated that about 100 of these are cluster members,
based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. For i>26.8 mag,
the radial and luminosity distribution of the UCD candidates can be explained
well by Abell 1689's globular cluster (GC) system. For i<26.8 mag, there is an
overpopulation of 15 +/- 5 UCD candidates with respect to the GC luminosity
function. For i<26 mag, the radial distribution of UCD candidates is more
consistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the GC system of Abell
1689. The UCD candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar to
that of Abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter by
about 2-3 mag. Two of the three brightest UCD candidates (M_V ~ -17 mag) are
slightly resolved. At the distance of Abell 1689, these two objects would have
King-profile core radii of ~35 pc and r_eff ~300 pc, implying luminosities and
sizes 2-3 times those of M32's bulge. Additional photometric redshifts obtained
with late type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignment
of these two resolved sources to Abell 1689. Our findings imply that in Abell
1689 there are at least 10 UCDs with M_V<-12.7 mag. Compared to the UCDs in the
Fornax cluster they are brighter, larger and have colors closer to normal dwarf
galaxies. This suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of the
stripping process. Spectroscopy is needed to definitely confirm the existence
of UCDs in Abell 1689.

denser environment around the primary star. I find that enhanced mass loss rate
during periastron passages, if it occurs, might explain the high eccentricity
of the system. However, there is not yet a good model to explain the presumed
enhanced mass loss rate during periastron passages. In the region where the
winds from the two stars collide, a dense slow flow is formed, such that large
dust grains may be formed. Unlike the case during the 19th century Great
Eruption, the companion does not accrete mass during most of its orbital
motion. However, near periastron passages short accretion episodes may occur,
which may lead to pulsed ejection of two jets by the companion. The companion
may ionize a non-negligible region in its surrounding, resembling the situation

more important role than has usually been recognized in the origin of the
stellar IMF and in determining a characteristic mass scale. The importance of
the thermal physics has been clearly demonstrated for the formation of the
first stars in the universe, where it is well understood and results in cooling
to a characteristic minimum temperature at a preferred density, and hence in a
characteristic scale for fragmentation. In present-day star-forming clouds, an
analogous situation may exist in that at low densities the temperature is
expected to decrease with increasing density, reaching a minimum when the gas
becomes thermally coupled to the dust and then rising slowly at higher
densities. A minimum temperature of about 5 K is predicted to occur at a
density of the order of 10^(-18) g cm^(-3), and at this point the Jeans mass is
about 0.3 solar masses, similar to the mass at which the IMF peaks. If most of
the fragmentation in star-forming clouds occurs in filaments, as is suggested
by many simulations as well as by observations, fragmentation seems likely to
occur preferentially at the density where the temperature reaches a minimum,
and the Jeans mass at this point may then determine a characteristic scale for

available: design and correct errors in BPEL4WS, using process algebra
verification tools, or design and correct in process algebra and automatically
obtaining the corresponding BPEL4WS code. The approaches can be combined.
Process algebra are not useful only for temporal logic verification: we remark
the use of simulation/bisimulation both for verification and for the
hierarchical refinement design method. It is worth noting that our approach
allows the use of any process algebra depending on the needs of the user at
different levels (expressiveness, existence of reasoning tools, user

maximally extension in the Kruskal coordinates, we provide a comoving

of N*(1650), N*(1710), and N*(1720) baryonic resonances. The parameters of the
model at the nucleon-nucleon-meson vertices are determined by fitting the
elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering with an effective interaction based on the
exchange of these four mesons, while those at the resonance vertices are
calculated from the known decay widths of the resonances and from the vector
meson dominance model. Experimental data taken recently by the COSY-11

diagram dominates the production process at both higher and lower beam
energies. The excitation of the N*(1650) resonance dominates both the

Namely, suppose n is odd and f(x) = x^n + Sum_{i in S} x^i + 1 in F_2[x], where
S subset {i : i odd, i < n/3} Union {i : i = n (mod 4), i < n} We show that if

  using ciphertext absolute value","12 pages, 8 figures, LaTeX format",,"10.1016/j.chaos.2004.07.006",,"nlin.CD",,"  This paper describes the security weakness of a recently proposed improved
chaotic encryption method based on the modulation of a signal generated by a
chaotic system with an appropriately chosen scalar signal. The aim of the
improvement is to avoid the breaking of chaotic encryption schemes by means of
the return map attack introduced by Perez and Cerdeira. A method of attack
based on taking the absolute value of the ciphertext is presented, that allows
for the cancellation of the modulation scalar signal and the determination of
some system parameters that play the role of system key. The proposed improved
method is shown to be compromised without any knowledge of the chaotic system
parameter values and even without knowing the transmitter structure.

plane waves is theoretically (Melnikov's method) and numerically (Lyapunov
exponents) investigated. In particular, the effectiveness of one of such waves
in controlling the chaotic dynamics induced by the remaining two waves is
theoretically predicted and numerically confirmed. Two mechanisms underlying
the chaos-suppression scenario are identified. One mechanism requires
chaos-inducing and chaos-suppressing waves to have both commensurate
wavelengths and commensurate relative (with respect to the remaining third
wave) phase velocities, while the other mechanism allows the chaotic dynamics
to be tamed when such quantities are incommensurate. The present findings may
be directly applied to several important problems in plasma physics, including
that of the chaos-induced destruction of magnetic surfaces in tokamaks.

intensities of two-step cascades to the low-lying levels of mentioned nuclei
were reproduced in calculation using level densities with clearly expressed
step-like structure. Radiative strength functions of the primary transitions
following gamma-decay of these compound nuclei to the levels in the region of
pointed structure are considerably enhanced. Moreover, population of levels
below 3 MeV can be reproduced only with accounting for local and rather
considerable increase in radiative strength functions of the secondary
transitions to the levels in vicinities of break points in energy dependence of
level density and significant decrease of that to lower-lying states.
Simultaneous change in both level density and strength functions in the same
excitation region of a nucleus corresponds to the definition of the
second-order phase transition.

"physics/0406136","Suresh Tiwari dr","S.C. Tiwari","Massless Electron and Fractional Spin as Electronic Charge",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The standard model (SM) of particle physics has been supported by several
experimental findings, the most remarkable of them being the discovery of the
weak gauge bosons, W and Z. It is expected that the Higgs boson could show up
by 2007 at LHC, CERN. In spite of this, the unsatisfactory features of the SM
at conceptual level, and exclusion of gravity from the unification scheme have
led to explore 'the physics beyond the SM'.
  A critique and comprehensive review of the contemporary fundamental physics
was presented in a monograph completed in the centenary year,1997 of the
discovery of the electron. A radically new approach to address foundational
problems was outlined: masslessness of bare electron, interpretation of the
squared electronic charge in terms of the fractional spin, $e^2/c$; new
physicalsignificance of the electromagnetic potentials, 2+1 dimensional
internal structure of electron and neutrino, and composite photon are some of
the ideas proposed. Though the monograph was reviewed by E. J. Post(Physics
Essays, June1999), it has remained largely inaccessible. I believe some of
these unconventional ideas have a potential to throw light on the fundamental
questions in physics, and therefore deserve a wider dissemination.
  The reader may find illuminating to supplement Section 3 on the weak gauge
bosons with a candid, graceful and personal recollection by Pierre
Darriulat(CERN Courier, April 2004, p.13).

paradox in which the moving clock performs a circular motion of constant
radius. The rest clock is denoted as (1), the rotating clock is (2), the
inertial frame in which (1) is at rest and (2) moves is I and, finally, the
accelerated frame in which (2) is at rest and (1) rotates is A. By using the
General Theory of Relativity in order to describe the motion of (1) as seen in
A we will show the following features. I) A differential aging between (1) and
(2) occurs at their reunion and it has an absolute character, i.e. the proper
time interval measured by a given clock is the same both in I and in A. II)
  From a quantitative point of view, the magnitude of the differential aging
between (1) and (2) does depend on the kind of rotational motion performed by
A. Indeed, if it is uniform there is no any tangential force in the direction
of motion of (2) but only normal to it. In this case, the proper time interval
reckoned by (2) does depend only on its constant velocity v=romega. On the
contrary, if the rotational motion is uniformly accelerated, i.e. a constant
force acts tangentially along the direction of motion, the proper time
intervals $do depend$ on the angular acceleration alpha. III) Finally, in
regard to the sign of the aging, the moving clock (2) measures always a
$shorter$ interval of proper time with respect to (1).

Submitted to Physica Scripta",,"10.1088/0031-8949/2005/T120/014",,"physics.atom-ph physics.plasm-ph",,"  Contrary to popular belief, the Zeeman effect can be treated exactly in
single-electron systems, for arbitrary magnetic field strengths, as long as the
term quadratic in the magnetic field can be ignored. These formulas were
actually derived already around 1927 by Darwin, using the classical picture of
angular momentum, and presented in their proper quantum-mechanical form in 1933
by Bethe, although without any proof. The expressions have since been more or
less lost from the literature; instead, the conventional treatment nowadays is
to present only the approximations for weak and strong fields, respectively.
However, in fusion research and other plasma physics applications, the magnetic
fields applied to control the shape and position of the plasma span the entire
region from weak to strong fields, and there is a need for a unified treatment.
In this paper we present the detailed quantum-mechanical derivation of the
exact eigenenergies and eigenstates of hydrogen-like atoms and ions in a static
magnetic field. Notably, these formulas are not much more complicated than the
better-known approximations. Moreover, the derivation allows the value of the
electron spin gyromagnetic ratio $g_s$ to be different from 2. For
completeness, we then review the details of dipole transitions between two
hydrogenic levels, and calculate the corresponding Zeeman spectrum. The various
approximations made in the derivation are also discussed in details.
