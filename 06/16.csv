massive stellar clusters powering these HII regions are resolved at the
arcsecond level into hundreds of stellar sources, similar to those seen in
closer young stellar clusters. However, we also detect diffuse X-ray emission
on parsec scales that is spatially and spectrally distinct from the point
source population. For nearby regions (e.g. M17 and Rosette) the emission is
soft, with plasma temperatures less than 10 million degrees, in contrast to
what is seen in more distant complexes (e.g. RCW49, W51).
  This extended emission most likely arises from the fast O-star winds
thermalized either by wind-wind collisions or by a termination shock against
the surrounding media. We have established that only a small portion of the
wind energy and mass appears in the observed diffuse X-ray plasma; in the
blister HII regions, we suspect that most of it flows without cooling into the
low-density interstellar medium through blow-outs or fissures in the
surrounding neutral material. These data provide compelling observational
evidence that strong wind shocks are present in HII regions.

connection: a Keplerian disk is connected to a Kerr black hole by a large-scale
magnetic field going through the transition region. We assume that the magnetic
field is locked to the inner boundary of the disk and corotates with the inner
boundary, the accretion rate is low but the accretion from the disk can still
provide enough amount of cold plasma particles in the transition region so that
the magnetohydrodynamics approximation is valid. Then, the magnetic field is
dynamically important in the transition region and affects the transportation
of energy and angular momentum. Close to the equatorial plane, the motion of
particles is governed by a one-dimensional radial momentum equation, which
contains a fast critical point as the only intrinsic singularity. By finding
solutions that smoothly pass the fast critical point, we find that a system
with a fast rotating black hole and that with a slow rotating black hole behave
very differently. For a black hole with $a > a_{\rm cr}\equiv 0.3594 M$, where
$M$ is the mass, $a$ the specific angular momentum of the black hole, the
spinning energy of the black hole is efficiently extracted by the magnetic
field and transported to the disk, increasing the radiation efficiency of the
disk by many orders of magnitude. For a black hole with $0\leq a < a_{\rm cr}$,
the inner region of the disk is disrupted by the magnetic field and the inner
boundary of the disk moves out to a radius where the Keplerian angular velocity
of the disk is equal to the spinning angular velocity of the black hole (which
is at infinity if the black hole is nonrotating). As a result, the disk may
have an extremely low radiation efficiency if $0\leq a/M \ll 1$.

are not detected in either the bluest (youngest) disk--dominated galaxies or

on the luminosity of the narrow [OIII] emission line (L_{[OIII]}), with low
L_{[OIII]} AGN having a higher clustering amplitude than high L_{[OIII]} AGN.
This is consistent with lower activity AGN residing in more massive galaxies
than higher activity AGN, and L_{[OIII]} providing a good indicator of the
fueling rate. Using a model relating halo mass to black hole mass in
cosmological simulations, we show that AGN hosted by ~ 10^{12} M_{odot} dark

from the globular cluster, whereas material ejected from stars with m < 7 M_sun
is retained, due to their weak stellar winds. By tracing the chemical evolution
of the intracluster gas, we tested an internal pollution scenario in which the
Na- and Al-enhanced ejecta from intermediate mass stars is either accreted onto
the surfaces of other stars, or goes toward forming new stars. The observed
spread in Na and Al was reproduced, but not the O-Na and Mg-Al
anticorrelations. In particular, neither O nor Mg are sufficiently depleted to
account for the observations. We predict that the Mg content of Na-rich cluster
stars should be overwhelmingly dominated by the 25,26Mg isotopes, whereas the
latest data shows only a mild 26Mg enhancement and no correlation with 25Mg.
Furthermore, stars bearing the imprint of intermediate mass stellar ejecta are
predicted to be strongly enhanced in both C and N, in conflict with the
empirical data. We find that while standard AGB stellar models do show the hot
H burning that seems required to explain the observations, this is accompanied
by He burning, producing primary C, N, Mg and Na (via HBB) which do not match

equilibria of magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs). The results of our

This has allowed us to calculate the theoretical histogram describing the
distribution of magnetic CVs as a function of P_spin / P_orb. We show that this
agrees with the observed distribution assuming that the number of systems as a
function of white dwarf magnetic moment is distributed approximately according
to N(mu_1) d mu_1 proportional to 1/mu_1 d mu_1. The rotational equilibria also
allow us to infer approximate values for the magnetic moments of all known
intermediate polars. We predict that intermediate polars with mu_1 > 5 x 10^33
G cm^3 and P_orb > 3h will evolve into polars, whilst those with mu_1 < 5 x
10^33 G cm^3 and P_orb > 3h will either evolve into low field strength polars
which are (presumably) unobservable, and possibly EUV emitters, or, if their
fields are buried by high accretion rates, evolve into conventional polars once
their magnetic fields re-surface when the mass accretion rate reduces. We
speculate that EX Hya-like systems may have low magnetic field strength
secondaries and so avoid synchronisation. Finally we note that the equilibria
we have investigated correspond to a variety of different types of accretion
flow, including disc-like accretion at small P_spin / P_orb values, stream-like
accretion at intermediate P_spin / P_orb values, and accretion fed from a ring

c_200 parameters of these clusters, and other values from the literature, are
fully consistent with the c_200 - M_200 relation derived from simulations. The
dispersion in scaled entropy profiles is small, implying self-similarity down
to low mass (kT ~2 keV), and is reduced by 30-40% (to ~20%) if we use the
empirical relation S \propto T^0.65 instead of the standard self-similar
relation, S \propto T. The mean scaled profile is well fitted by a power law
for 0.05 < r_200 < 0.5, with a slope slightly lower than expected from pure
shock heating (\alpha = 0.94+/-0.14), and a normalisation at 0.1 r_200
consistent with previous studies. The gas history thus likely depends both on
gravitational processes and the interplay between cooling and various galaxy
feedback mechanisms.

a significantly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, with a mean location C_{BI}

elongated from the North-West to the South-East with two main density peaks
associated with two substructures. The North-West subcluster is probably in the
early phase of merging into the South-East substructure (~ 0.2 Gyr before core
crossing). A dynamical study of the two subclouds points out the existence of a
group of star-forming galaxies infalling into the core of the South-East
subcloud and suggests that two other groups are infalling into the NW and SE
subclusters respectively. These three subgroups contain a higher fraction of
star-forming galaxies than the cluster core, as expected during merging events.
Abell 1367 appears as a young cluster currently forming at the intersection of
two filaments.

introduced in TDDFT allows a clear separation of quasiparticle and excitonic

part f_xc^Ex in terms of the effective vertex function Lambda. The latter
fulfills an integral equation which thereby establishes the exact
correspondence between TDDFT and the standard many-body approach based on
Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE).The diagrammatic structure of the kernel in the

Should the cancellation take place, already the first-order approximation to
f_xc^Ex is sufficient. A potential advantage of TDDFT over the many-body BSE
method is thus dependent on the efficiency of the above-quoted cancellation. We
explicitly verify this for an analytically solvable two-dimensional two-band

variables of distinct nature (e.g. saving ratio, expectations, etc.). The
agents interact locally by their individual variables: for example, people
working in the same office may influence their peers' expectations
(optimism/pessimism are contagious), while people living in the same
neighborhood may influence their peers' saving patterns (stinginess/largeness
are contagious). Thus, for each type of variable there exists a different
underlying social network, which we refer to as a ``layer''. Each layer
connects the same set of agents by a different set of links defining a
different topology. In different layers, the nature of the variables and their
dynamics may be different (Ising, Heisenberg, matrix models, etc). The
different variables belonging to the same agent interact (the level of optimism
of an agent may influence its saving level), thus coupling the various layers.
We present a simple instance of such a network, where a one-dimensional Ising
chain (representing the interaction between the optimist-pessimist
expectations) is coupled through a random site-to-site mapping to a
one-dimensional generalized Blume-Capel chain (representing the dynamics of the
agents' saving ratios). In the absence of coupling between the layers, the
one-dimensional systems describing respectively the expectations and the saving
ratios do not feature any ordered phase (herding). Yet, such a herding phase
emerges in the coupled system, highlighting the non-trivial nature of the
present framework.

describes the three different regimes usually observed, as a function of the

dependent on the vaporization energy Ev, of the solid. The true ablation

grid) drawing} of a graph represents the vertices by points in $\mathbb{Z}^3$
and the edges by non-crossing line-segments. This paper contributes three main
results:
  (1) It is proved that the minimum volume of a certain type of
three-dimensional drawing of a graph $G$ is closely related to the queue-number
of $G$. In particular, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex member of a proper minor-closed
family of graphs (such as a planar graph), then $G$ has a $O(1)\times
O(1)\times O(n)$ drawing if and only if $G$ has O(1) queue-number.
  (2) It is proved that queue-number is bounded by tree-width, thus resolving
an open problem due to Ganley and Heath (2001), and disproving a conjecture of
Pemmaraju (1992). This result provides renewed hope for the positive resolution
of a number of open problems in the theory of queue layouts.
  (3) It is proved that graphs of bounded tree-width have three-dimensional
drawings with O(n) volume. This is the most general family of graphs known to
admit three-dimensional drawings with O(n) volume.
  The proofs depend upon our results regarding \emph{track layouts} and
\emph{tree-partitions} of graphs, which may be of independent interest.

classical ether-drift experiments with the conclusion that the small observed
deviations should not be neglected. In fact, within the framework of Lorentzian
Relativity, they might indicate the existence of a preferred frame relatively
to which the Earth is moving with a velocity v_earth\sim 200$ km/s (value
projected in the plane of the interferometer). We have checked this idea by
comparing with the modern ether-drift experiments, those where the observation
of the fringe shifts is replaced by the difference \Delta \nu in the relative
frequencies of two cavity-stabilized lasers, upon local rotations of the
apparatus or under the Earth's rotation. It turns out that, even in this case,
the most recent data are consistent with the same value of the Earth's
velocity, once the vacuum within the cavities is considered a physical medium
whose refractive index is fixed by General Relativity. We thus propose a sharp
experimental test that can definitely resolve the issue. If the small
deviations observed in the classical ether-drift experiments were not mere
instrumental artifacts, by replacing the high vacuum in the resonating cavities
with a dielectric gaseous medium (e.g. air), the typical measured \Delta\nu\sim
1 Hz should increase by orders of magnitude. This expectation is consistent
with the characteristic modulation of a few kHz observed in the original
experiment with He-Ne masers. However, if such enhancement would not be
confirmed by new and more precise data, the existence of a preferred frame can
be definitely ruled out.

The equations are explicitly symmetric under exchange of the two pure spinors
and a choice of even or odd-rank RR field. This is mirror symmetry for
manifolds with torsion. Moreover, RR fluxes affect only one of the two
equations: exp(iJ) is closed under the action of the twisted exterior
derivative in IIA theory, and similarly Omega is closed in IIB. Modulo a
different action of the B-field, this means that supersymmetric SU(3)-structure
manifolds are all generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds, as defined by Hitchin. An
equivalent, and somewhat more conventional, description is given as a set of
relations between the components of intrinsic torsions modified by the NS flux
and the Clifford products of RR fluxes with pure spinors, allowing for a
classification of type II supersymmetric vacua on six-manifolds. We find in
particular that supersymmetric six-manifolds are always complex for IIB

are played by the notion of strong duality and a trace mapping constructed by
Greenlees and May in the context of generalized Tate cohomology. We give some
examples where algebraic data on coefficient rings ensures strong topological
consequences. We consider the issue of passage from algebraic Galois extensions
to topological ones applying obstruction theories of Robinson and
Goerss-Hopkins to produce topological models for algebraic Galois extensions
and the necessary morphisms of commutative S-algebras. Examples such as the
complex K-theory spectrum as a KO-algebra indicate that more exotic phenomena
occur in the topological setting. We show how in certain cases topological
abelian Galois extensions are classified by the same Harrison groups as
algebraic ones and this leads to computable Harrison groups for such spectra.
We end by proving an analogue of Hilbert's theorem 90 for the units associated

optical telescopes are misadjustments of the mirrors, deformations of
monolithic mirrors, and misalignments of segments in segmented mirrors. For
active optics corrections, all three errors, which can partially compensate
each other, are measured simultaneously. It is therefore of interest to
understand the similarities and differences between the three corresponding
types of modes which describe these errors. The first two types are best
represented by Zernike polynomials and elastic modes respectively, both of them
being continuous and smooth functions. The segment misaligment modes, which are
derived by singular value decomposition, are by their nature not smooth and in
general discontinuous. However, for mirrors with a large number of segments,
the lowest modes become effectively both smooth and continuous. This paper
derives analytical expressions for these modes, using differential operators
and their adjoints, for the limit case of infinitesimally small segments. For
segmented mirrors with approximately 1000 segments, it is shown that these
modes agree well with the corresponding lowest singular value decomposition
modes. Furthermore, the analytical expressions reveal the nature of the segment
misalignment modes and allow for a detailed comparison with the elastic modes
of monolithic mirrors. Some mathematical features emerge as identical in the
two cases.

a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture into the neighborhood of an association
resonance, either photoassociation or Feshbach, as well as the subsequent
prospects for Cooper-like pairing between atoms and molecules. In the simplest
case of only one molecular state, corresponding to either a Feshbach resonance
or one-color photoassociation, the system displays Rabi oscillations and rapid
adiabatic passage between a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and fermionic
molecules. For two-color photoassociation, the system admits stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms to stable Fermi
molecules, even in the presence of particle-particle interactions. By tailoring
the STIRAP sequence it is possible to deliberately convert only a fraction of
the initial atoms, leaving a finite fraction of bosons behind to induce
atom-molecule Cooper pairing via density fluctuations; unfortunately, this
enhancement is insufficient to achieve a superfluid transition with present
ultracold technology. We therefore propose the use of an association resonance
that converts atoms and diatomic molecules (dimers) into triatomic molecules
(trimers), which leads to a crossover from a Bose-Einstein condensate of
trimers to atom-dimer Cooper pairs. Because heteronuclear dimers may possess a
permanent electric dipole moment, this overall system presents an opportunity
to investigate novel microscopic physics.
