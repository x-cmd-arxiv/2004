Fabry-Perot observations of the Halpha emission. With their large field of view
and high spatial resolution, the Fabry-Perot data allow to probe
simultaneously, in 2-D, two kinematical features of the tidal ionized gas:
large-scale velocity gradients due to streaming motions along the tails, and
small-scale motions related to the internal dynamics of giant HII regions
within the tails. In several interacting systems, massive (10^9 Msun)
condensations of HI, CO and stars are observed in the outer regions of tails.
Whether they are genuine accumulations of matter or not is still debated.
Indeed a part of the tidal tail may be aligned with the line-of-sight, and the
associated projection effect may result in apparent accumulations of matter
that does not exist in the 3-D space. Using numerical simulations, we show that
studying the large-scale kinematics of tails, it is possible to know whether
these accumulations of matter are the result of projection effects or not. We
conclude that several ones are genuine accumulations of matter. We also study
the small-scale motions inside these regions: several small-scale velocity
gradients are identified with projected values as large as 50-100 km/s accross
the observed HII regions. In one system, the spatial resolution of our
observations is sufficient to detail the velocity field; we show that it is
rotating and self-gravitating, and discuss its dark matter content. The
Fabry-Perot observations have thus enabled us to prove that some 10^9 Msun
condensations of matter are real structures, and are kinematically decoupled
from the rest of the tail. Such massive and self-gravitating objects are the
progenitors of the so-called ''Tidal Dwarf Galaxies''.

the 4--27 micron Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the distant ultraluminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS F00183--7111 (z=0.327). The absorption features of CO2 and
CO gas, water ice, hydrocarbons and silicates are indicative of a strongly
obscured (A[9.6]>=5.4; A[V]>=90) and complex line of sight through both hot
diffuse ISM and shielded cold molecular clouds towards the nuclear power
source. From the profile of the 4.67 micron CO fundamental vibration mode we
deduce that the absorbing gas is dense (n~10^6 cm^-3) and warm (720 K) and has
a CO column density of ~10^19.5 cm^-2, equivalent to N[H]~10^23.5 cm^-2. The
high temperature and density, as well as the small infered size (<0.03pc),
locates this absorbing gas close to the power source of this region. Weak
emission features of molecular hydrogen, PAHs and Ne+, likely associated with
star formation, are detected against the 9.7 micron silicate feature,
indicating an origin away from the absorbing region. Based on the 11.2 micron
PAH flux, we estimate the star formation component to be responsible for up to
30% of the IR luminosity of the system. While our mid-infrared spectrum shows
no tell-tale signs of AGN activity, the similarities to the mid-infrared
spectra of deeply obscured sources (e.g. NGC4418) and AGN hot dust (e.g.
NGC1068), as well as evidence from other wavelength regions, suggest that the

it's su bsequent large period oscillation due to magnetohydrodynamic

simplified two dimensional-geometry magnetohydrodynamic calculation of a plane
fluid jet embedded in a neutral sheet with the profiles taken from our 3D

showing that the sinuous mode is the dominant mode that develops into a
velocity-shear-instability with a growth rate of $5 \times 10^{-9}

to IR fluorescence from (mainly) FUV pumped PAHs. As such, they trace the FUV
stellar flux and are a measure of star formation. We examined the IR spectral
characteristics of Galactic star forming regions, normal and starburst
galaxies, AGNs and ULIRGs. The goal is to analyze if PAH bands are a good
qualitative and/or quantitative tracer of star formation and hence the
application of PAH bands as a diagnostic in order to identify the dominant
processes contributing to the IR emission from Seyfert's and ULIRGs. We develop
a MIR/FIR diagnostic and compare it to known diagnostics, with these also
applied to the Galactic sample. This diagnostic is based on the FIR normalized
6.2 um PAH flux and the FIR normalized 6.2 um continuum flux. The Galactic
sources form a sequence spanning a range of 3 orders of magnitude, from
embedded compact HII regions to exposed PDRs and the (D)ISM. The variation in
the 6.2 um PAH/continuum ratio is relative small. Normal and starburst galaxies
ressemble exposed PDRs. While Seyfert-2's coincide with the starburst trend,
Seyfert-1's are displaced by at least a factor 10 in 6.2 um continuum flux.
ULIRGs show a diverse spectral appearance (AGN hot dust continuum,
starburst-like or strong dust obscuration in the nucleus). ULIRGs also seems to
have more prominent FIR emission than either starburst galaxies or AGNs. We
discuss the observed variation in the Galactic sample in view of the
evolutionary state and the PAH/dust abundance and the use of PAHs as
quantitative tracers of star formation activity. We find that PAHs may be
better suited as a tracer of B stars, which dominate the Galactic stellar
energy budget, than as a tracer of massive star formation (O stars).

crucial, as the solar magnetic field is compressed at the Termination Shock by
the slowing flow. Recently, our simulations showed that the Heliosheath
presents remarkable dynamics, with turbulent flows and the presence of a jet
flow at the current sheet that is unstable due to magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities \cite{opher,opher1}. In this paper we review these recent
results, and present an additional simulation with constant neutral atom
background. In this case the jet is still present but with reduced intensity.
Further study, e.g., including neutrals and the tilt of the solar rotation from

Galactic dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. A HSMEM method is used to
separate the SZ signal from contaminating components in combination with a

identify clusters and to obtain their fluxes. We estimate a survey sensitivity
limit (depending on the quality of the recovered cluster flux) and provide
cluster survey completeness and purity estimates. We find that given our

thousands of clusters over the full sky. The exact number depends on the
particular cosmological model (up to 10000 cluster detections in a concordance

Only if the density is known this distance can be determined through the

transitions. O V is known to have metastable levels that are density dependent.
We study the population of those levels under photoionisation equilibrium
conditions and determine for which parameter range they can have a significant
population. We find that resonance line trapping plays an important role in
reducing the critical densities above which the metastable population becomes
important. We investigate the K-shell absorption lines from these metastable
levels. Provided that there is a sufficient population of the metastable
levels, the corresponding K-shell absorption lines are detectable and are well
separated from the main absorption line originating from the ground state. We
then present the Chandra LETGS spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 279 that

lines. A firm identification is not yet possible due to both uncertainties in
the observed wavelength of the strongest line as well as uncertainties in the

to monotonic gradients of absorbing column densities in front of a finite
emission source. Our main finding is that simple power-law and gaussian
distributions are hard pressed to fit the Mrk 279 high-quality UV outflow data.
An acceptable fit for the O VI troughs can only be obtained by assuming
unrealistic optical depth values (upward of 100). The strongest constraints
arise from the attempt to fit the Lyman series troughs. In this case it is
evident that even allowing for complete freedom of both the power-law exponent
and the optical depth as a function of velocity cannot yield an acceptable fit.
In contrast, partial covering models do yield good fits for the Lyman series
troughs. We conclude that monotonic inhomogeneous absorber models that do not
include a sharp edge in the optical depth distribution across the source are
not an adequate physical model to explain the trough formation mechanism for
the outflow observed in Mrk 279.

objects. While capable of identifying grazing binary eclipses, this technique
cannot reliably identify blends, a chance overlap of a faint background
eclipsing binary with an ordinary foreground star. Blends generally have no
observable radial velocity shifts, as the foreground star is brighter by
several magnitudes and therefore dominates the spectrum, but their combined
light can produce events that closely resemble those produced by transiting
exoplanets.
  The radial velocity technique takes advantage of the mass difference between
planets and stars to classify exoplanet candidates. However, the existence of
blends renders this difference an unreliable discriminator. Another difference
must therefore be utilized for this classification -- the physical size of the
transiting body. Due to the dependence of limb darkening on color, planets and
stars produce subtly different transit shapes. These differences can be
relatively weak, little more than 1/10th the transit depth. However, the
presence of even small color differences between the individual components of
the blend increases this difference. This paper will show that this color
difference is capable of discriminating between exoplanets and blends reliably,
theoretically capable of classifying even terrestrial-class transits, unlike
the radial velocity technique.

package for neutralino dark matter calculations. In DarkSUSY one can compute
the neutralino density in the Universe today using precision methods which
include resonances, pair production thresholds and coannihilations. Masses and
mixings of supersymmetric particles can be computed within DarkSUSY or with the
help of external programs such as FeynHiggs, ISASUGRA and SUSPECT. Accelerator
bounds can be checked to identify viable dark matter candidates. DarkSUSY also
computes a large variety of astrophysical signals from neutralino dark matter,
such as direct detection in low-background counting experiments and indirect
detection through antiprotons, antideuterons, gamma-rays and positrons from the
Galactic halo or high-energy neutrinos from the center of the Earth or of the

applicable both in the diffusive and the ballistic regimes; we focus on the

fields is an interplay of two contributions arising from different sources of
particle-hole asymmetry, namely the curvature of the zero-field electron
dispersion and the particle-hole asymmetry associated with Landau quantization.
The former contribution is positive and governs the high-temperature increase
in the drag resistivity. On the other hand, the latter one, which is dominant
at low $T$, has an oscillatory sign (depending on the difference in filling
factors of the two layers) and gives rise to a sharp peak in the temperature

two-dimensional (2D) quasi long-range crystalline order (QLRCO) and

the melting of 2D quasi Josephson vortex lattices and suppression of

Peak dielectric constants of ca. 25,000 are obtained, and Curie-Weiss analysis
demonstrates 1st order transformation behavior. This is in surprising contrast
to results on conventionally deposited thin film heterostructures, which show
large dielectric peak broadening and temperature shifts [e.g. C. B. Parker,
J-P. Maria and A. I. Kingon, Appl. Phys. Lett., 81, 340 (2002)], as well as an
apparent change in the nature of the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition from
1st to 2nd order. Our data are compatible with the recent model by Bratkovsky

that will exist in any thin film capacitor heterostructure, either through
defect profiles introduced during growth, or through subtle asymmetry between
top and bottom electrodes. The observed recovery of 1st order transformation
behavior is consistent with the absence of significant substrate clamping in
our experiment, as modeled by Pertsev et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., 80, 1988 (1998),
and illustrates that the 2nd order behaviour seen in conventionally deposited
thin films cannot be attributed to the effects of reduced dimensionality in the
system, nor to the influence of an intrinsic universal interfacial capacitance
associated with the electrode-ferroelectric interface.

consistent with the existence of the massive Universe, and with the effects of
its gravitational interaction on local physics. A reanalysis of the situation
suggests that all relativistic effects that are presently attributed to
kinematics of relative motion in flat space-time are in fact gravitational
effects of the nearly homogeneous and isotropic Universe. The correct theory of
relativity is the one with a preferred cosmic rest frame. Yet, the theory
preserves Lorentz invariance. I outline the new theory of Cosmic Relativity,
and its implications to local physics, especially to physics of clocks and to
quantum physics. This theory is generally applicable to inertial and
noninertial motion. Most significanlty, experimental evidence support and
favour Cosmic Relativity. There are observed effects that can be consistently
explained only within Cosmic Relativity. The most amazing of these is the
dependence of the time dilation of clocks on their `absolute' velocity relative
to the cosmic rest frame. Important effects on quantum systems include the
physical cause of the Thomas precession responsible for part of the spectral
fine structure, and the phase changes responsible for the spin-statistics
connection. At a deeper level it is conlcuded that relativity in flat

multiplication map which is the only known way to define a diffeomorphism

proposed. Based on compactified five-dimensional gauge theories, these models
achieve unitarity of electroweak boson self-interactions through the exchange
of a tower of massive vector bosons rather than the exchange of a scalar Higgs
boson. In this paper, using deconstruction, we analyze the form of the
corrections to the electroweak interactions in a large class of these models,
allowing for arbitrary 5-D geometry, position-dependent gauge coupling, and
brane kinetic energy terms. We show that many models considered in the
literature, including those most likely to be phenomenologically viable, are in
this class. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the correlation function of
gauge currents at high momentum, we extract the exact form of the relevant
correlation functions at tree-level and compute the corrections to precision
electroweak observables in terms of the spectrum of heavy vector bosons. We
determine when nonoblique corrections due to the interactions of fermions with
the heavy vector bosons become important, and specify the form such
interactions can take. In particular we find that in this class of models, so
long as the theory remains unitary, S-4 c^2__W T > O(1), where S and T are the
usual oblique parameters. We concur with the result of Cacciapaglia et.al. that
small or negative S is possible -- though only at the expense of substantial
negative T at tree-level. Although we stress our results as they apply to
continuum 5-D models, they apply also to models of extended electroweak gauge
symmetries motivated by models of hidden local symmetry.

consequences of nonlinear nuclear k_t-factorization for interactions of
pointlike photons and non-pointlike pions. In the former case the large
transverse momentum p_t of jets comes from the intrinsic momentum of quarks and
antiquarks in the photon and nuclear effects manifest themselves as an
azimuthal decorrelation with an acoplanarity momentum of the order of the
nuclear saturation momentum Q_A. In the breakup of pions off free nucleons to
the leading order in pQCD the spectator parton has a small transverse momentum
and the hard dijet cross section is suppressed. In the breakup of pions off
heavy nuclei the forward hard jets are predicted to be entirely decorrelated.
We comment on the sensitivity of the pionic dijet cross section to the pion
distribution amplitude. The predicted distinction between the breakup of
photons and pions can be tested by the sphericity and thrust analysis of the
forward hadronic system in the COMPASS experiment at CERN.

plane-wave, in the presence of a constant NSNS B-field background. We show that
in response to the background B-field the giant graviton would take the shape
of a deformed three-sphere, the size and shape of which depend on the B-field,
and that the giant becomes classically unstable once the B-field is larger than
a critical value B_{cr}. In particular, for the B-field which is
(anti-)self-dual under the SO(4) isometry of the original giant S^3, the closed
string metric is that of a round S^3, while the open string metric is a
squashed three-sphere. The squashed giant can be interpreted as a bound state
of a spherical three-brane and circular D-strings. We work out the spectrum of
geometric fluctuations of the squashed giant and study its stability. We also
comment on the gauge theory which lives on the brane (which is generically a
noncommutative theory) and a possible dual gauge theory description of the
deformed giant.

light-cone Hamiltonian matrix elements calculated in the plane-wave background

discussed in this paper. The first is the phenomenon of intermittency in the
dissipation field. Dissipation-range intermittency was first discovered
experimentally by Batchelor and Townsend over fifty years ago. It is
characterized by spatio-temporal binary behaviour in which long, quiescent
periods in the velocity signal are interrupted by short, active `events' during
which there are violent fluctuations away from the average. The second and
related problem is whether solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations develop
finite time singularities during these events. This paper shows that Leray's
weak solutions of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
can have a binary character in time. The time-axis is split into `good' and
`bad' intervals: on the `good' intervals solutions are bounded and regular,
whereas singularities are still possible within the `bad' intervals. An
estimate for the width of the latter is very small and decreases with
increasing Reynolds number. It also decreases relative to the lengths of the
good intervals as the Reynolds number increases. Within these `bad' intervals,
lower bounds on the local energy dissipation rate and other quantities, such as
$\|\bu(\cdot, t)\|_{\infty}$ and $\|\nabla\bu(\cdot, t)\|_{\infty}$, are very
large, resulting in strong dynamics at sub-Kolmogorov scales. Intersections of
bad intervals for $n\geq 1$ are related to Scheffer's potentially singular set
in time. It is also proved that the Navier-Stokes equations are conditionally
regular provided, in a given `bad' interval, the energy has a lower bound that
is decaying exponentially in time.

simple approach for the activity in in-homogeneously stirred flows. We show
that the fractal patterns serving as skeletons and catalysts lead to a rate

the dependence of the velocity of wave propagation on the taxis has two
distinct forms, ``parabolic'' and ``linear''. Transition from one form to the
other correlates with changes in the shape of the wave profile. Dependence of
the propagation velocity on diffusion in this system differs from the
square-root dependence typical of reaction-diffusion waves. We demonstrate also
that, for systems with negative and positive taxis, for example, pursuit and
evasion, there typically exists a large region in the parameter space, where
the waves demonstrate quasisoliton interaction: colliding waves can penetrate
through each other, and waves can also reflect from impermeable boundaries.

electronic nanobiosensor based on a G-protein coupled receptor. By adopting a
coarse grain description, the protein is modeled as a complex network of
elementary impedances. The positions of the alpha-carbon atoms of each amino
acid are taken as the nodes of the network. The amino acids are assumed to
interact electrically among them. Consequently, a link is drawn between any
pair of nodes neighboring in space within a given distance and an elementary
impedance is associated with each link. The value of this impedance can be
related to the physical and chemical properties of the amino acid pair and to
their relative distance. Accordingly, the conformational changes of the
receptor induced by the capture of the ligand, are translated into a variation
of its electrical properties. Stochastic fluctuations in the value of the
elementary impedances of the network, which mimic different physical effects,
have also been considered. Preliminary results concerning the impedance

of a constant unitary transformation to a quantum system. By recasting these
walks into the setting of periodic perturbations to an otherwise freely
evolving system we introduce the concept of a stroboscopic quantum walk.
Through numerical simulation, we establish the link between families of
stroboscopic walks and quantum resonances. These are observed in the nonlinear
systems of quantum chaos theory such as the delta-kicked rotator or the
delta-kicked accelerator.

classical ray optics. We show that a very useful approximation to the Casimir
force between arbitrarily shaped smooth conductors can be obtained from
knowledge of the paths of light rays that originate at points between these
bodies and close on themselves. Although an approximation, the optical method
is exact for flat bodies, and is surprisingly accurate and versatile. In this
paper we present a self-contained derivation of our approximation, discuss its
range of validity and possible improvements, and work out three examples in
detail. The results are in excellent agreement with recent precise numerical
analysis for the experimentally interesting configuration of a sphere opposite
an infinite plane.

inequality which is violated by some quantum mechanical predictions,

problems. This formulation reduces the computation time to less than 5% of the
