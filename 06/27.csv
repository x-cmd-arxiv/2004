collisions by use of N-body simulations. Reflecting the violent gravitational
processes, the velocity distribution of the resultant quasi-stationary state
generally becomes non-Gaussian. Through the strong mixing of the violent
process, there appears a universal non-Gaussian velocity distribution, which is
a democratic (equal-weighted) superposition of many Gaussian distributions (DT
distribution). This is deeply related with the local virial equilibrium and the
linear mass-temperature relation which characterize the system. We show the
robustness of this distribution function against various initial conditions
which leads to the violent gravitational process. The DT distribution has a
positive correlation with the energy fluctuation of the system. On the other
hand, the coherent motion such as the radial motion in the spherical collapse
and the rotation with the angular momentum suppress the appearance of the DT
distribution.

Gaussianity of the WMAP 1-year data. Such an analysis is facilitated by the
introduction of a fast directional continuous spherical wavelet transform. The
directional nature of the analysis allows one to probe orientated structure in
the data. Significant deviations from Gaussianity are detected in the skewness
and kurtosis of spherical elliptical Mexican hat and real Morlet wavelet
coefficients for both the WMAP and Tegmark et al. (2003) foreground-removed

the spherical symmetric Mexican hat wavelet is confirmed, although their
detection at the 99.9% significance level is only made at the 95.3%
significance level using our most conservative statistical test. Furthermore,
deviations from Gaussianity in the skewness of spherical real Morlet wavelet
coefficients on a wavelet scale of 550 arcmin (corresponding to an effective
global size on the sky of approximately 26 degrees and an internal size of 3
degrees) at an azimuthal orientation of 72 degrees, are made at the 98.3%
significance level, using the same conservative method. The wavelet analysis
inherently allows one to localise on the sky those regions that introduce
skewness and those that introduce kurtosis. Preliminary noise analysis
indicates that these detected deviation regions are not atypical and have
average noise dispersion. Further analysis is required to ascertain whether
these detected regions correspond to secondary or instrumental effects, or
whether in fact the non-Gaussianity detected is due to intrinsic primordial
fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.

radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) accreting at close to the Eddington
limit and those accreting at considerably lower rates - can be explained in
terms of the adiabatic inflow-outflow (ADIOS) scenario for radiatively
inefficient accretion. Whenever the accretion rate falls below a threshold
value (corresponding to a luminosity L_crit) that depends on the viscosity
parameter, alpha, the inner region of the accretion disk - extending from the
marginally stable orbit to ~ 1000 Schwarzschild radii - is susceptible to
becoming hot and radiatively inefficient. If this happens, the disk luminosity
decreases by a factor of ~100, as most of the matter originally destined to be
swallowed is instead expelled in a wind. According to our conjecture, accretion
flows onto black holes never radiate steadily in the range ~ 0.01 L_crit < L <
L_crit, hence the inferred accretion rate gap. We expect the gap to exist also
for black holes in X-ray binaries, where it may be responsible for state
transitions and the luminosity fluctuations associated with X-ray nova
outbursts.

determined self-consistently. For a controlled and systematic implementation of
the self-consistency scheme we use the fixed-energy (FE) approach to the DMFT.
In FE-DMFT the onset and the width of the Hubbard bands are adjusted
self-consistently but the energies of the bath levels are kept fixed relatively
to both band edges during the calculation of self-consistent hybridization
strengths between impurity and bath sites. Using the dynamical density-matrix
renormalization group method (DDMRG) we calculate the density of states with a
resolution ranging from 3% of the bare bandwidth $W=4t$ at high energies to
0.5% in the vicinity of the gap. The DDMRG resolution and accuracy for the
density of states and the gap is superior to those obtained with other
numerical methods in previous DMFT investigations. We find that the Mott gap
closes at a critical coupling $U_{\rm c}/t=4.45 \pm 0.05$. At $U=4.5t$, we
observe prominent shoulders near the onset of the Hubbard bands. They are the
remainders of the quasi-particle resonance in the metallic phase which appears
to split when the gap opens at $U_{\rm c}$.

The lateral resolution of this technique was ca.20 nm, which can be increased
to a single nanometer level by choosing sharper AFM tips. Because the AFM is a

cytoskeleton by its density and volume. The types of fibers can be identified

two-fluid, drift-MHD theory in slab geometry. In both cases, the island
equation of motion is found to take exactly the same form as that predicted by
single-fluid MHD theory. Three separate ion polarization terms are found in the
Rutherford island width evolution equation. The first is the drift-MHD
polarization term for an isolated island, and is completely unaffected by
interaction with a wall or magnetic perturbation. Next, there is the
polarization term due to interaction with a wall or magnetic perturbation which
is predicted by single-fluid MHD theory. Finally, there is a hybrid of the
other two polarization terms. The sign of this term depends on many factors.
However, under normal conditions, it is stabilizing if the unperturbed island
propagates in the ion diamagnetic direction (in the lab. frame), and
destabilizing if it propagates in the electron diamagnetic direction.

2- and 3-dimensional Ising models as well as that of the 2-dimensional Potts
models. This method is based on the transfer matrix method and using the
limited lattice for the calculation. The reduced internal energy per site has
been accurately calculated for different 2-D Ising and Potts models using
different size-limited lattices. All calculated energies intersect at a single
point when plotted versus the reduced temperature. The reduced temperature at
the intersection is 0.4407, 0.2746, and 0.6585 for the square, triangular, and
honeycombs Ising lattices and 1.0050, 0.6309, and 1.4848 for the square,
triangular, and honeycombs Potts lattices, respectively. These values are
exactly the same as the critical temperatures reported in the literature,
except for the honeycomb Potts lattice. For the two-dimensional Ising model, we
have shown that the existence of such an intersection point is due to the
duality relation. The method is then extended to the simple cubic Ising model,
in which the intersection point is found to be dependent on the lattice sizes.
We have found a linear relation between the lattice size and the intersection
point. This relation is used to obtain the critical temperature of the
unlimited simple cubic lattice. The obtained result, 0.221(2), is in a good
agreement with the accurate value of 0.22165 reported by others.
