sight, weak lensing is an unavoidable systematic uncertainty in the use of type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological distance indicators. We derive the
expected weak lensing signatures of SNe Ia by convolving the intrinsic
distribution in SN Ia peak luminosity with magnification distributions of point
sources. We analyze current SN Ia data, and find marginal evidence for weak
lensing effects. The statistics is poor because of the small number of observed
SNe Ia. Future observational data will allow unambiguous detection of the weak
lensing effect of SNe Ia. The observational signatures of weak lensing of SNe
Ia that we have derived provide useful templates with which future data can be
compared.

these sources are extremely promising intermediate-mass black hole candidates

weighted by 1/Vmax, was obtained and compared with other determinations. The
mass distribution of the white dwarfs is derived, after important corrections
for the radii of the white dwarfs in this magnitude-limited survey and for the
cooling time scales. The formation rate of DA white dwarfs from the PG is
estimated to be 0.6x10^(-12) pc^(-3) yr^(-1). Comparison with predictions from
a theoretical study of the white dwarf formation rate for single stars
indicates that >80% of the high mass component requires a different origin,
presumably mergers of lower mass double degenerate stars. In order to estimate
the recent formation rate of all white dwarfs in the local Galactic disk,
corrections for incompleteness of the PG, addition of the DB-DO white dwarfs,
and allowance for stars hidden by luminous binary companions had to be applied
to enhance the rate. An overall formation rate of white dwarfs recently in the
local Galactic disk of 1.15+/-0.25x10^(-12) pc^(-3) yr^(-1) is obtained. Two

Submitted to ApJ Letters","Astrophys.J. 617 (2004) L131","10.1086/427233",,"astro-ph",,"  We demonstrate that nucleosynthesis in rapid, high-entropy expansions of
proton-rich matter from high temperature and density can result in a wider
variety of abundance patterns than heretofore appreciated. In particular, such
expansions can produce iron-group nuclides, p-process nuclei, or even heavy,
neutron-rich isotopes. Such diversity arises because the nucleosynthesis enters
a little explored regime in which the free nucleons are not in equilibrium with
the abundant alpha particles. This allows nuclei significantly heavier than
iron to form in t he presence of abundant free nucleons early in the expansion.
As the temperature drops, nucleons increasingly assemble into alpha particles
and heavier nuclei. If the assembly is efficient, the resulting depletion of
free neutrons allows disintegrat ion flows to drive nuclei back down to iron
and nickel. If this assembly is inefficient, then the large abundance of free
nucleons prevents the disintegration flows and leaves a distribution of heavy
nuclei after reaction freezeout. For cases in between, an intermediate
abundance distribution, enriched in p-process isotopes, is frozen out. These
last expansions may contribute to the solar system's supply of the p-process
nuclides if mildly proton-rich, high-entropy matter is ejected from
proto-neutron stars winds or other astrophysical sites. Also sign ificant is
the fact that, because the nucleosynthesis is primary, the signature of this
nucleosyn thesis may be evident in metal poor stars.

these stars, yet many fundamental mechanisms operating in their magnetic fields
still elude an interpretation through a detailed physical description. Stellar
X-ray astronomy is therefore contributing toward a deeper understanding of the
generation of magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic dynamos, the release of
energy in tenuous astrophysical plasmas through various plasma-physical
processes, and the interactions of high-energy radiation with the stellar
environment. Stellar X-ray emission also provides important diagnostics to
study the structure and evolution of stellar magnetic fields from the first
days of a protostellar life to the latest stages of stellar evolution among
giants and supergiants. The discipline of stellar coronal X-ray astronomy has
now reached a level of sophistication that makes tests of advanced theories in
stellar physics possible. This development is based on the rapidly advancing
instrumental possibilities that today allow us to obtain images with
sub-arcsecond resolution and spectra with resolving powers exceeding 1000.
High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy has, in fact, opened new windows into
astrophysical sources, and has played a fundamental role in coronal research.

simulation of structure formation of a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmology. We
investigate the distribution of matter between neighbouring large haloes whose
masses are comparable to massive clusters of galaxies. We identify a total of
228 filaments between neighbouring clusters. Roughly half of the filaments are
either warped or lie off the cluster--cluster axis. We find that straight
filaments on the average are shorter than warped ones. More massive clusters
are connected to more filaments than less massive ones on average. This finding
indicates that the most massive clusters form at the intersections of the
filamentary backbone of LSS. For straight filaments, we compute mass profiles.
Radial profiles show a fairly well--defined radius, $r_s$, beyond which the
profiles follow an $r^{-2}$ power law fairly closely. For the majority of
filaments, $r_s$ lies between 1.5 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and 2.0 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The
enclosed overdensity inside $r_s$ varies between a few times up to 25 times
mean density, independent of the length of the filaments. Along the filaments'
axes, material is not distributed uniformly. Towards the clusters, the density
rises, indicating the presence of the cluster infall regions. In addition, we
also find some sheet--like connections between clusters. In roughly a fifth of
all cluster--cluster connections where we could not identify a filament or
sheet, projection effects lead to filamentary structures in the projected mass
distribution. (abridged)

an initially constant or weak decay. After the break, most cases are consistent
with a decay with index -2/3. Some pulses have a weak non-thermal component
overlayed the thermal one, and are better modelled with a combination of a
thermal and a non-thermal component. Such a two-component model can explain the
whole time-evolution of other bursts, that are found to be only initially
thermal and later become non-thermal. The relative strengths between the two
components vary with time and this is suggested to, among other things, account
for the change in the modelled low-energy power-law slope that is often
observed in bursts. We interpret the observations within a model of an
optically thick shell that expands adiabatically. The slow, or constant,
temperature decrease is from the acceleration phase, during which the bulk
Lorentz factor increases, and the faster temperature decay is reached as the
flow saturates and starts to coast with a constant speed. We also discuss a
Poynting-flux model, in which the saturation radius is reached close to the

of the Mira variables o Cet, R Leo, and chi Cyg from the K band to the 11
micron region revealed by the recent interferometric observations using narrow
bandpasses where no salient spectral feature is present (Weiner et al. 2003a,
2003b). A simple two-layer model consisting of hot and cool H2O layers for the
warm water vapor envelope can reproduce the angular diameters observed with
Infrared Spatial Interferometer as well as the high-resolution TEXES spectra
obtained in the 11 micron region. The strong absorption of H2O expected from
the dense water vapor envelope is filled in by emission from the extended part
of the envelope, and this results in the high-resolution 11 micron spectra
which exhibit only weak, fine spectral features, masking the spectroscopic
evidences of the dense, warm water vapor envelope. On the other hand, the
presence of the warm water vapor envelope manifests itself as the larger
angular diameters in the 11 micron region as compared to those measured in the
near-infrared. Furthermore, comparison of the visibilities predicted in the
near-infrared with observational results available in the literature
demonstrates that our two-layer model for the warm water vapor envelope can
also reproduce the observed near-infrared visibilities and angular diameters.
The radii of the hot H2O layers in the three Mira variables are derived to be
1.5--1.7 Rstar with temperatures of 1800--2000 K and H2O column densities of
(1--5) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}, while the radii of the cool H2O layers are derived to

neutral hydrogen (HI) appears as a background radiation in low frequency radio
observations. The angular and frequency domain fluctuations in this radiation
carry information about cosmological structure formation. We propose that
correlations between visibilities measured at different baselines and
frequencies in radio-interferometric observations be used to quantify the
statistical properties of these fluctuations. This has an inherent advantage
over other statistical estimators in that it deals directly with the
visibilities which are the primary quantities measured in radio-interferometric
observations. Also, the visibility correlation has a very simple relation with
power spectrum. We present estimates of the expected signal for nearly the
entire post-recombination era, from the dark ages to the present epoch. The
epoch of reionization, where the HI has a patchy distribution, has a distinct
signature where the signal is determined by the size of the discrete ionized
regions. The signal at other epochs, where the HI follows the dark matter, is
determined largely by the power spectrum of dark matter fluctuations. The
signal is strongest for baselines where the antenna separations are within a
few hundred times the wavelength of observation, and an optimal strategy would
preferentially sample these baselines. In the frequency domain, for most
baselines the visibilities at two different frequencies are uncorrelated beyond
\Delta \nu ~ 1 MHz, a signature which in principle would allow the HI signal to
be easily distinguished from the continuum sources of contamination.

and narrow-band filters in the wavelength range from 1 to 19 micrometer and are
obtained with ESO's infrared cameras ISAAC and TIMMI2 and with SpectroCam-10
(Mt. Palomar). The high sensitivity and resolution provided by these facilities
revealed intriguing new details of this star-forming region and especially
about the embedded hot molecular core (HMC) - component F. We analyse the newly
found infrared sub-structure of four objects in this HMC region. While one of
these objects (F2) is probably a foreground field star, the nature of the
brightest object in the near-infrared there (F1) remains somewhat enigmatic.
Our new astrometry proves that this object is not coincident with the peak of
the molecular line emission of the HMC, but displaced by 1.7 arcsecs (nearly
10000 AU on a linear scale). We estimate this object to be an additional
embedded object with a dense dust shell. Very near the HMC location we find L'
band emission which strongly rises in flux towards longer wavelengths. We
presume that this emission (F4) arises from the envelope of the HMC which is
known to be associated with a molecular outflow roughly aligned along the line
of sight. Thus, the clearing effect of this outflow causes strong deviations
from spherical symmetry which might allow infrared emission from the HMC to
escape through the outflow cavities. This presents the first direct detection
of an HMC at a wavelength as short as 3.8 micron. At 11.7 and 18.75 micron, the
HMC counterpart F4 ultimately proves to be the most luminous IR source within
the G9.62+0.19-F region.

so-called ``cycles'': such structures arise when tilings are encoded via the
``partition-on-tiling'' method and are susceptible to break connectivity by
flips or at least ergodicity, because they locally suppress a significant
amount of flip degrees of freedom. We first address the so-far open question of
the connectivity of tiling sets by elementary flips. We prove exactly that sets
of tilings of codimension one and two are connected for any dimension and
tiling size. For higher-codimension tilings of dimension 3, the answer depends
on the precise choice of the edge orientations, which is a non-trivial issue.
In most cases, we can prove connectivity despite the existence of cycles. In
the few remaining cases, among which the icosahedral symmetry, the question
remains open. We also study numerically flip-assisted diffusion to explore the
possible effects of the previously mentioned cycles. Cycles do not seem to slow
down significantly the dynamics, at least as far as self-diffusion is
concerned.

there is a broad range of variable values, common for all three functions,

$C_{vol}/T\sqrt{H}=f(T/\sqrt{H})$ of d-wave superconductivity. It is found that
the scaling law can be nicely followed by the optimally doped sample (x=0.15)
in quite wide region of ($T/\sqrt{H} \leq 8 K /\sqrt{T}$). However, the region
for this scaling becomes smaller and smaller towards more underdoped region: a
clear trend can be seen for samples from x=0.15 to 0.069. Therefore, generally
speaking, the scaling quality becomes worse on the underdoped samples in terms
of scalable region of $T/\sqrt{H}$. This feature in the underdoped region is
explained as due to the low energy excitations from a second order (for
example, anti-ferromagnetic correlation, d-density wave, spin density wave or
charge density wave order) that may co-exist or compete with superconductivity.
Surprisingly, deviations from the d-wave scaling law have also been found for
the overdoped sample (x=0.22). While the scaling law is reconciled for the
overdoped sample when the core size effect is taken into account. An important
discovery of present work is that the zero-temperature data follow the

the transparency of the insulating barrier between DN and a superconductor. It

scattering in DN for any value of the barrier transparency. In low-transparent

conductance is enhanced by magnetic impurity scattering. The physical origin of
this effect is discussed. For the d-wave junctions, the dependence on the

the magnetic impurity scattering only for low transparent junctions with

new important evidence through the analytic study of an exactly solvable model

perspective for the understanding of the deep origin of first and second order
phase transitions, respectively. In particular, a remarkable theoretical result
consists of a new mathematical characterization of first order transitions.
Moreover, we show that a ""reduced"" configuration space can be defined in terms
of collective variables, such that the correspondence between phase transitions

relationship is worked out between the microscopic description of a classical
N-body system and its macroscopic thermodynamic behaviour. This consists of a
functional dependence of thermodynamic entropy upon the Morse indexes of the
critical points (saddles) of the constant energy hypersurfaces of the
microscopic 2N-dimensional phase space. Thus phase space (and configuration

agents with common priors will never ""agree to disagree"": if their opinions
about any topic are common knowledge, then those opinions must be equal.
Economists have written numerous papers examining the assumptions behind this
theorem. But two key questions went unaddressed: first, can the agents reach
agreement after a conversation of reasonable length? Second, can the
computations needed for that conversation be performed efficiently? This paper
answers both questions in the affirmative, thereby strengthening Aumann's
original conclusion.
  We first show that, for two agents with a common prior to agree within
epsilon about the expectation of a [0,1] variable with high probability over
their prior, it suffices for them to exchange order 1/epsilon^2 bits. This
bound is completely independent of the number of bits n of relevant knowledge
that the agents have. We then extend the bound to three or more agents; and we
give an example where the economists' ""standard protocol"" (which consists of
repeatedly announcing one's current expectation) nearly saturates the bound,
while a new ""attenuated protocol"" does better. Finally, we give a protocol that
would cause two Bayesians to agree within epsilon after exchanging order
1/epsilon^2 messages, and that can be simulated by agents with limited
computational resources. By this we mean that, after examining the agents'
knowledge and a transcript of their conversation, no one would be able to
distinguish the agents from perfect Bayesians. The time used by the simulation
procedure is exponential in 1/epsilon^6 but not in n.

shown that the causal geometry of such a quantum space-time possesses a rich
hierarchical structure. The natural extension of the Poincare group to quantum
space-time is investigated. In particular, we prove that the symmetry group of
a quantum space-time is generated in general by a system of irreducible Killing
tensors. When the symmetries of a quantum space-time are spontaneously broken,
then the points of the quantum space-time can be interpreted as space-time
valued operators. The generic point of a quantum space-time in the broken
symmetry phase thus becomes a Minkowski space-time valued operator. Classical
space-time emerges as a map from quantum space-time to Minkowski space. It is
shown that the general such map satisfying appropriate causality-preserving
conditions ensuring linearity and Poincare invariance is necessarily a density

that the signal can be visible when the branching ratio of $h^0 \to \tau^\pm

generated at loop level due to the slepton mixing. When supersymmetric mass
parameters are larger than TeV scales, the branching ratio can be as large as
several times $10^{-4}$. Therefore, the signal can be marginally visible at a

distinction becomes apparent in a behavior of scalar amplitude near the
threshold. For 4-dimensional cutoff the pole term can be extracted, which
corresponds to sigma-meson. For dimensionally-analytical regularization the

disappeared at some value of the regularization parameter.

demonstrate, that these contributions though their relatively smallness can
destabilize the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with 4-dimensional cutoff. On the

decreases linearly with the quark mass and is expected to vanish in the chiral
limit. On the contrary, within the quenched approximation, the neutron EDM
increases as the quark mass decreases and is expected to diverge as (1/m)**Nf
in the chiral limit. We argue that such a qualitatively different behavior is a
parameter-free, semi-classical prediction and occurs because the neutron EDM is
sensitive to the topological structure of the vacuum. The present analysis
suggests that quenched and unquenched lattice QCD simulations of the neutron
EDM as well as of other observables governed by topology might show up
important differences in the quark mass dependence, for mq < Lambda(QCD).

tends to the fully uncompactified one (lifetime T = const M^5/g^2), as

certain class of string models in the large-D limit, it matches that of QCD at
large N. This crucial matching is again a consequence of the negative
stiffness. In the discussion of the finite-temperature properties of the 3D

the effects produced by some extensions of the model by external matter fields,

nucleon-nucleon collisions by studying single and double polarization
observables. Over the last years, the eta meson has been studied at several
different experiments mainly by measurements of unpolarized total and
differential cross sections. To reveal the production mechanism, polarization
observables help to disentangle the amplitudes of the partial waves and
therefore to understand the underlying exchange processes. Analyzing powers
have been measured enabling to separate the contributing amount of some of
these amplitudes. Double polarization observables will widen the number of
accessible amplitudes and hence give further constraints to the theoretical
models. Due to the trigonometric symmetries in polarization measurements, a
symmetric detector geometry in the azimuthal angle is preferable. The WASA
detector with its 4-pi geometry for neutral and charged particles together with
the use of a frozen spin target should therefore allow to study double
polarization observables not only in vec{p}vec{p} but also in vec{p}vec{d} or
vec{d}vec{p} collisions. This first requires the development of a frozen-spin
target whereas single polarization observables can be measured directly with

revealed that gene expression shows a stationary organization described by a
power-law distribution (scale-free organization) (i.e., gene expression $k$
decays as $k^{-\gamma}$), which is highly conserved in all the major five
kingdoms of life, from Bacteria to Human. An underlying gene expression
dynamics ""rich-travel-more"" was suggested to recover that evolutional
conservation of transcriptional organization. Here we propose a constructive
approach to gene expression dynamics with larger scope. Our gene expression
construction restores the stationary state, predicts the power-law exponent for
different organisms with natural explanation for small correction at high and
low expression levels, describes the intermediate state dynamics (time finite)
and elucidates the gene expression stability. This approach requires only one
assumption: Markov property.

start with the center-of-mass equation of motion and derive a dynamical
expression for the Casimir-Polder force acting on an atom prepared in an
arbitrary electronic state. For a non-driven atom in the weak coupling regime,
the force as a function of time is shown to be a superposition of force
components that are related to the electronic density matrix elements at chosen
time. These force components depend on the position-dependent polarizability of
the atom that correctly accounts for the body-induced level shifts and

dispersive, transparent dielectric leads to the definition of canonical and
kinetic forms for the momentum of the electromagnetic field in a dispersive
medium. The canonical momentum is uniquely defined as the operator that
generates spatial translations in a uniform medium, but the quantization scheme
suggests two possible choices for the kinetic momentum operator, corresponding
to the Abraham or the Minkowski momentum in classical electrodynamics. Another
implication of this procedure is that a wave packet containing a single dressed
photon travels at the group velocity through the medium. The physical
significance of the canonical momentum has already been established by
considerations of energy and momentum conservation in the atomic recoil due to
spontaneous emission, the Cerenkov effect, the Doppler effect, and phase
matching in nonlinear optical processes. In addition, the data of the Jones and
Leslie radiation pressure experiment is consistent with the assignment of one
?k unit of canonical momentum to each dressed photon. By contrast, experiments
in which the dielectric is rigidly accelerated by unbalanced electromagnetic
forces require the use of the Abraham momentum.

described that is valid in both systems and can determine the characteristic

and its relation to energy dissipation is also studied. Finally, a scheme is
