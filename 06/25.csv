space-based open field survey for supernovae (SNe). In cooperation with the
Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, we have used the Hubble Space
Telescope with the Advanced Camera for Surveys to cover 300 square arcmin in
the area of the Chandra Deep Field South and the Hubble Deep Field North on
five separate search epochs (separated by 45 day intervals) to a limiting
magnitude of z'=26. These deep observations have allowed us to discover 42 SNe
in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.6. As these data span a large range in
redshift, they are ideal for testing the validity of Type Ia supernova
progenitor models with the distribution of expected ``delay times,'' from
progenitor star formation to SN Ia explosion, and the SN rates these models
predict. Through a Bayesian maximum likelihood test, we determine which
delay-time models best reproduce the redshift distribution of SNe Ia discovered
in this survey. We find that models that require a large fraction of ``prompt''
(less than 2 Gyr) SNe Ia poorly reproduce the observed redshift distribution
and are rejected at 95% confidence. We find that Gaussian models best fit the
observed data for mean delay times in the range of 3 to 4 Gyr.

during quiescence occurs via a geometrically thin disk in the outer part and
via an advection-dominated hot coronal flow/ADAF in the inner part. The inner
part important for the radiation yields a hard spectrum. In most sources the
luminosity increase during outburst causes a change over to a soft spectrum
which can be understood as that of a multi-color black body disk reaching
inward to the marginally stable orbit. A few transient sources do not display
this transition to the soft state. We show that this can be understood as due
to relatively low peak luminosities in outburst in systems with short orbital
periods and therefore less mass accumulated in the then smaller accretion disk.
This is in agreement with the observations which show that most likely short
orbital period systems remain in the hard spectral state.

order to model the pre-supernova evolution of rotating massive stars. Rotating
and non-rotating stellar models at solar metallicity with masses equal to 12,
15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 solar masses were computed from the ZAMS until the end of
the core silicon burning phase. We took into account meridional circulation,
secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical shear
instabilities.
  Most of the differences between the pre-supernova structures obtained from
rotating and non-rotating stellar models have their origin in the effects of
rotation during the core hydrogen and helium burning phases.
  The effects of rotation on pre-supernova models are significant between 15
and 30 solar masses. Indeed, rotation increases the core sizes (and the yields)
by a factor ~ 1.5. Above 20 solar masses, rotation may change the colour of the
supernova progenitors (blue instead of red supergiant) and the supernova type
(Ib instead of II). Rotation affects the lower mass limits for radiative core
carbon burning, for iron core collapse and for black hole formation. For
Wolf-Rayet stars (M > 30 solar masses), the pre-supernova structures are mostly
affected by the intensities of the stellar winds and less by rotational mixing.
Finally, the core of our rotating WR stars contain enough angular momentum to
produce GRBs.

measurements presented here and comparison with previous observations by
BeppoSAX, SIGMA and CGRO/OSSE show that the overall spectrum from soft X-rays
up to the gamma-rays can be described by a highly absorbed (N_H = 2.7e23

thermal emission (T = 0.8 keV) of low abundance (7% solar), plus a constant Fe
K-alpha and K-beta line. The hard X-ray component is well described by a simple
power law with a mean photon index of 1.7. During the INTEGRAL observations the
20 - 100 keV flux increased by a factor of 1.4. The analysis of XMM-Newton data
implies that the emission below 3 keV is decoupled from the AGN and probably
due to extended emission as seen in Chandra observations. The constant iron
line emission is apparently also decoupled from the direct emission of the
central engine and likely to be generated in the obscuring material, e.g. in

different optical wavelengths, and our framework permits to obtain the source
size ratios when a microlensing special high-magnification event (e.g., a
caustic crossing event, a two-dimensional maximum crossing event and so on) is
produced in one of the QSO components. To infer the source size ratios, only
cross-correlations between the brightness records in different optical bands
are required. While the deconvolution method leads to a richer information (1D
intrinsic luminosity profiles), the new approach is free of the technical
problems with complex inversion procedures. Using simulations related to recent
VR data of Q2237+0305A, we discuss the ability of the scheme in the
determination of the visible-to-red ratio q = $R_V/R_R$. We conclude that
extremely accurate fluxes (with a few microJy uncertainties, or equivalently, a
few milli-magnitudes errors) can lead to ~10% measurements of q. Taking into
account the errors in the fluxes of Q2237+0305A from a normal ground-based
telescope, ~10 microJy (~10 mmag), it must be possible the achievement of
smaller errors from the current superb-telescopes, and thus, an accurate
determination of q. Obviously, to measure the visible-to-red ratio, the light
curves cannot be contaminated by an intrinsic event or an important
high-frequency intrinsic signal, i.e., exceeding the microJy (mmag) level. For
an arbitrary lensed QSO, we finally remark that the framework seems to work
better with very fast microlensing events.

may imply an intimate relation between starburst, responsible for the metal
enrichment of the nuclear gas, and AGN fueling, represented by the accretion
rate. The correlation of metallicity with luminosity, or black hole (BH) mass,
is weaker in contrast with recent results which were based on measurements of

[O III] lines while the remaining objects show no or very weak such line. While
weak [O III] emitters are also found among lower luminosity AGN, we argue that
the implications for very high luminosity objects are different. In particular,
we suggest that the averaging of these two populations in other works gave rise
to claims of a Baldwin relationship in [O III] which is not confirmed by our
data. We also argue that earlier proposed relations of the type R_NLR \propto
L_[O III]^{1/2}, where R_NLR is the NLR radius, are theoretically sound yet
they must break down for R_NLR exceeding a few kpc. This suggests that the NLR
properties in luminous sources are different from those observed in nearby AGN.
In particular, we suggest that some sources lost their very large, dynamically
unbound NLR while others are in a phase of violent star-forming events that
produce a large quantity of high density gas in the central kpc. This gas is
ionized and excited by the central radiation source and its spectroscopic
properties may be different from those observed in nearby, lower luminosity
NLRs. We also discuss the dependence of EW(Hb) and Fe II/Hb on L, M_BH, and
accretion rate for a large sample of AGNs. The strongest dependence of the two
quantities is on the accretion rate and the Fe II/Hb correlation is probably
due to the EW(Hb) dependence on accretion rate. We show the most extreme values
measured so far of Fe II/Hb and address its correlation with EW([O III]).

objects at the magnitude limit. This indicates that high redshift galaxies are

the sizes follow a (1+z)^{-1.05+/-0.21} scaling towards high redshift. A more

spiral galaxy, M31, comprise 2 distinct entities, differing in 3 respects. 1.
M31 has young GCs, ages from ~100 Myr to 5 Gyr old, as well as old globular
clusters. No such young GCs are known in the Milky Way. 2. We confirm that the
oldest M31 GCs have much higher nitrogen abundances than do Galactic GCs at
equivalent metallicities. 3. Morrison et al. found M31 has a subcomponent of
GCs that follow closely the disk rotation curve of M31. Such a GC system in our
own Galaxy has yet to be found. These data are interpreted in terms of the
hierarchical-clustering-merging (HCM) paradigm for galaxy formation. We infer
that M31 has absorbed more of its dwarf systems than has the Milky Way. This
inference has 3 implications: 1. All spiral galaxies likely differ in their GC
properties, depending on how many companions each galaxy has, and when the
parent galaxy absorbs them. The the Milky Way ties down one end of this
spectrum, as almost all of its GCs were absorbed 10-12 Gyr ago. 2. It suggests
that young GCs are preferentially formed in the dwarf companions of parent
galaxies, and then absorbed by the parent galaxy during mergers. 3. Young GCs
seen in tidally-interacting galaxies might come from dwarf companions of these
galaxies, rather than be made a-new in the tidal interaction. There is no ready
explanation for the marked difference in nitrogen abundance for old M31 GCs
relative to the oldest Galactic GCs. The predictions made by Li & Burstein
regarding the origin of nitrogen abundance in globular clusters are consistent
with what is found for the old M31 GCs compared to that for the two 5 Gyr-old
M31 GCs.

can be used to determine the intrinsic blazar spectrum. Unfortunately, neither
the EBL intensity nor the intrinsic blazar spectrum is known with high enough
precision to accurately derive one quantity from the other. In this paper we
use the most recent data on the EBL to construct twelve different realizations
representing all possible permutations between EBL limits and the detections in
the different wavelength regions. We use these realizations to explore the
effects of the EBL on the inferred spectra of blazars. In particular, we show
that the frequently cited ""IR background-TeV gamma-ray crisis"" does not exist,
and derive the intrinsic spectra and peak energies of the blazars Mrk 421, 501

shift to higher energies at higher flux states. Finally, we also explore the
effect of the uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the gamma-ray

for probing theoretical hierarchical growth models. Gravitational lensing is a
unique mechanism for acquiring this information in systems at cosmologically
significant redshifts. We review the calculations required to include SMBHs in
two standard galactic lens models, a cored isothermal sphere and a broken power
law. The presence of the SMBH produces two primary effects depending on the
lens configuration, either blocking the ``core'' image that is usually
predicted to form from a softened lens model, or adding an extra, highly
demagnified, image to the predictions of the unaltered lens model. The
magnitudes of these effects are very sensitive to galaxy core sizes and SMBH
masses. Therefore, observations of these lenses would probe the properties of
the inner regions of galaxies, including their SMBHs. Lensing cross-sections
and optical depth calculations indicate that in order to fully observe these
characteristic signatures, flux ratios of order 10^6 or more between the
brightest and faintest images of the lens must be detectable, and thus the next
generation of radio telescope technology offers the first opportunity for a
serious observational campaign. Core images, however, are already detectable
and with additional observations their statistics may be used to guide future
SMBH searches.

central black hole masses to explore their jet formation mechanisms. The jet
power of AGNs is estimated from their extended radio luminosity. It is found
that the jets in several AGNs of this sample are too powerful to be extracted
from the standard thin accretion disks or rapidly spinning black holes
surrounded by standard thin disks. If the advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs) are present in these AGNs, their bright optical continuum luminosity
cannot be produced by pure-ADAFs due to their low accretion rates and low
radiation efficiency, unless the ADAFs transit to standard thin disks at some
radii $R_{\rm tr}$. If this is the case, we find that the dimensionless
accretion rates as high as 0.05 and transition from ADAFs to standard thin
disks at rather small radii around 20GM/c^2 are required to explain their
bright optical continuum emission. We propose that the disk-corona structure is
present at least in some AGNs in this sample. The plasmas in the corona are
very hot, and the pressure scale-height of the corona H\sim R. Powerful jets
with Q_jet \sim L_bol (bolometric luminosity) can form by the large-scale
magnetic fields created by dynamo processes in the disk corona of some AGNs.
The maximal jet power extractable from the corona Q_jet^max\le 0.6L_c (L_c is
the corona luminosity) is expected by this jet formation scenario. The
statistic results on the sample of AGNs are consistent with the predictions of
this scenario. Finally, the possibility that the jet is driven from a
super-Keplerian rotating hot layer located between the corona and the cold disk
is discussed. We find that, in principle, this layer can also produce a
powerful jet with Q_jet\sim L_bol.

associations (or groups). Assuming rapid escape of parental cloud gas from
associations, we show that the shadow of the formation environment for
associations can be partially imprinted on the velocity dispersion at their
dissolution. This conclusion is not surprising as long as associations are
formed in a multiphase interstellar medium, because the external pressure
should suppress expansion caused by the internal motion of the parental clouds.
Our model predicts a few km s$^{-1}$ as the internal velocity dispersion.
Observationally, the internal velocity dispersion is $\sim 1$ km s$^{-1}$ which
is smaller than our prediction. This suggests that the dissipation of internal
energy happens before the formation of OB associations.

dissipation close to a state of \textit{marginal stability} with respect to the
dynamics in the galaxy plane. Here we present numerical evidences that warps
play a similar role but in the transverse direction. N-body simulations show
that typical galactic disks are also marginally stable with respect to a
bending instability leading to typical observed warps. The frequent occurrence
of warps and asymmetries in the outer galactic disks give therefore, like bars
in the inner disks, new constraints on the dark matter, but this time in the
outer disks. If disks are marginally stable with respect to bending
instabilities, our models suggest that the mass within the HI disks must be a
multiple of the detected HI and stars, i.e., disks must be heavier than seen.
But the models do not rule out a traditional thick halo with a mass within the
HI disk radius similar to the total disk mass.

segregation which also agrees with observational constraints. This thus
indicates that the Pleiades is well relaxed and that it is suffering from

indistinguishable from the standard or Galactic-field IMF for stars with mass m
< 2 Mo, provided the Pleiades precursor had a central density of about 10^4.8
stars/pc^3. A denser model with 10^5.8 stars/pc^3 also leads to reasonable
agreement with observational constraints, but owing to the shorter relaxation
time of the embedded cluster it evolves through energy equipartition to a
mass-segregated condition just prior to residual-gas expulsion. This model
consequently looses preferentially low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (BDs), but
the effect is not very pronounced. The empirical data indicate that the
Pleiades IMF may have been steeper than Salpeter for stars with m > 2 Mo.

explored theoretically and by numerical simulation for Ising spin glasses with
short-ranged interactions. The theoretical part develops a picture of
non-equilibrium glassy dynamics recently introduced by the authors. Invoking
the concept of marginal stability, this theory links irreversible
`intermittent' events, or `quakes' to thermal fluctuations of record magnitude.
The pivotal idea is that the largest energy barrier $b(t_w,T)$ surmounted prior
to $t_w$ by thermal fluctuations at temperature $T$ determines the rate $r_q
\propto 1/t_w$ of the intermittent events occurring near $t_w$. The idea leads
to a rate of intermittent events after a negative temperature shift given by
$r_q \propto 1/t_w^{eff}$, where the `effective age' $t_w^{eff} \geq t_w$ has
an algebraic dependence on $t_w$, whose exponent contains the temperatures
before and after the shift. The analytical expression is verified by numerical
simulations. Marginal stability suggests that a positive temperature shift $T
\to T'$ could erase the memory of the barrier $b(t_w,T)$. The simulations show
that the barrier $b(t_w,T') \geq b(t_w,T)$ controls the intermittent dynamics,
whose rate is hence $r_q \propto 1/t_w$.
  Additional `rejuvenation' effects are also identified in the intermittency
data for shifts of both signs.

YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films to date have been performed on films
where the \textit{c}-axis is grown normal to the film surface. With such films,
the analysis of the dependence of $j_c$ on the magnetic field angle is complex.
The effects of extrinsic contributions to the angular field dependence of
$j_c$, such as the measurement geometry and disposition of pinning centres, are
convoluted with those intrinsically due to the anisotropy of the material. As a
consequence of this, it is difficult to distinguish between proposed FLL
structure models on the basis of angular critical current density measurements
on \textit{c}-axis films. Films grown on mis-cut (vicinal) substrates have a
reduced measurement symmetry and thus provide a greater insight into the
critical current anisotropy. In this paper previous descriptions of the
magnetic field angle dependence of $j_c$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ are
reviewed. Measurements on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films grown on a
range of vicinal substrates are presented and the results interpreted in terms
of the structure and dimensionality of the FLL in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$.
There is strong evidence for a transition in the structure of the flux line
lattice depending on magnetic field magnitude, orientation and temperature. As
a consequence, a simple scaling law can not, by itself, describe the observed
critical current anisotropy in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. The experimentally
obtained $j_c(\theta)$ behaviour of YBCO is successfully described in terms of
a kinked vortex structure for fields applied near parallel to the \textit{a-b}

loss rate of condensate atoms and the amount of stable ground state molecules
achievable within a certain time are found to be stronger limited than
according to mean field theory. By systematically treating the dynamics of the
connected Green's function for pair correlations the resonantly driven
population of the excited molecular state as well as scattering into the
continuum of non-condensed atomic states are taken into account. A detailed
analysis of the low energy stationary scattering properties of two atoms
modified by the near resonant photoassociation laser, in particular of the
dressed state spectrum of the relative motion prepares for the analysis of the
many body dynamics. The consequences of the finite lifetime of the resonantly
coupled bound state are discussed in the two body as well as in the many body
context. Extending the two body description to scattering in a tight trap
reveals the modifications to the near resonant adiabatic dressed levels caused
by the decay of the excited molecular state.

however, the quantitative predictions were limited by a dependence of the

turns-out, with this additional assumption, nearly all atoms are within the
classical fields, thus the method applies to the whole system.

$\epsilon$ of the energy of interaction between segments (within a sphere whose
radius coincides with the cut-off length for the potential) to the thermal
energy, and the ratio $\delta$ of the cut-off length to the radius of gyration
for a Gaussian chain. Unlike conventional approaches grounded on the mean-field
evaluation of the end-to-end distance, the Green function is found explicitly
(in the first approximation with respect to $\epsilon$). It is demonstrated
that (i) the distribution function depends on $\epsilon$ in a regular way,
while its dependence on $\delta$ is singular, and (ii) the leading term in the
expression for the mean square end-to-end distance linearly grows with
$\epsilon$ and remains independent of $\delta$.

to discriminate among different models using experimental observables. We
exemplify the technique in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard
model. If supersymmetric particles are discovered, models of supersymmetry
breaking will be fit to the observed spectrum and it is beneficial to ask
beforehand: what accuracy is required to always allow the discrimination of two
particular models and which are the most important masses to observe? Each
model predicts a bounded patch in the space of observables once unknown
parameters are scanned over. The questions can be answered by minimising a
""distance"" measure between the two hypersurfaces. We construct a distance
measure that scales like a constant fraction of an observable.
  Genetic algorithms, including concepts such as natural selection, fitness and
mutations, provide a solution to the minimisation problem. We illustrate the
efficiency of the method by comparing three different classes of string models
for which the above questions could not be answered with previous techniques.
The required accuracy is in the range accessible to the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) when combined with a future linear collider (LC) facility. The technique
presented here can be applied to more general classes of models or observables.

fully consistently within this scheme. An extended stochastic method is used to
solve the collision integral. The frame dependence and convergency are studied
for a fixed tube with thermal initial conditions. The detailed numerical
analysis shows that the stochastic method is fully covariant and that
convergency is achieved more efficiently than within a standard geometrical
formulation of the collision term, especially for high gluon interaction rates.
The cascade is then applied to simulate parton evolution and to investigate
thermalization of gluons for a central Au+Au collision at RHIC energy. For this
study the initial conditions are assumed to be generated by independent
minijets with p_T > p_0=2 GeV. With that choice it is demonstrated that overall
kinetic equilibration is driven mainly by the inelastic processes and is
achieved on a scale of 1 fm/c. The further evolution of the expanding gluonic
matter in the central region then shows almost an ideal hydrodynamical
behavior. In addition, full chemical equilibration of the gluons follows on a

ways of looking up on standard problems in many areas of theoretical physics.
Inspired in the recent developments of string theory, the Brane World picture
involves the introduction of new extra dimensions beyond the four we see, which
could either be compact or even open (infinite). The sole existence of those
new dimensions may have non trivial observable effects in short distance
gravity experiments, as well as in our understanding of the cosmology of the
early Universe, among many other issues. The goal of the present notes is to
provide a short introduction to some basic aspects of the Brane World models.
The discussion includes models with flat compact extra dimensions, as well as
the so called Randall-Sundrum models.

interpretation of the solar neutrino data is considered in a more general
framework where non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) are present. Such
interactions may be regarded as a generic feature of models of neutrino mass.
The 766.3 ton-yr data sample of the KamLAND collaboration are included in the
analysis, paying attention to the background from the reaction ^13C(\alpha,n)
^16O. Similarly, the latest solar neutrino fluxes from the SNO collaboration
are included. In addition to the solution which holds in the absence of NSI
(LMA-I) there is a 'dark-side' solution (LMA-D) with sin^2 theta_Sol = 0.70,
essentially degenerate with the former, and another light-side solution (LMA-0)
allowed only at 97% CL. More precise KamLAND reactor measurements will not
resolve the ambiguity in the determination of the solar neutrino mixing angle
theta_Sol, as they are expected to constrain mainly Delta m^2. We comment on
the complementary role of atmospheric, laboratory (e.g. CHARM) and future solar
neutrino experiments in lifting the degeneracy between the LMA-I and LMA-D
solutions. In particular, we show how the LMA-D solution induced by the
simplest NSI between neutrinos and down-type-quarks-only is in conflict with
the combination of current atmospheric data and data of the CHARM experiment.
We also mention that establishing the issue of robustness of the oscillation
picture in the most general case will require further experiments, such as
those involving low energy solar neutrinos.

D=4 gauged supergravity obtained in a previous paper. In the case where the
Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is timelike, it is shown
that the nonlinear partial differential equations determining the BPS solutions
can be derived from a variational principle. The corresponding action enjoys a
solution-generating PSL(2,R) symmetry. In certain subcases the system reduces
to different known theories, like two-dimensional dilaton gravity or the
dimensionally reduced gravitational Chern-Simons theory. We find new
supersymmetric solutions including, among others, kinks that interpolate
between two AdS_4 vacua, electrovac waves on anti-Nariai spacetimes, or
generalized Robinson-Trautman solutions. In the case where the Killing vector
is null, we obtain a complete classification. The one quarter and one half
supersymmetric solutions are determined explicitely, and it is shown that the
fraction of three quarters of supersymmetry cannot be preserved. Finally, the
general lightlike configuration is uplifted to eleven-dimensional supergravity.

in heterotic models, the dynamics of which are not thermal and can be described
in a well controlled manner throughout. The phase transition is driven by the
evolution of bundle moduli - moduli associated with gauge field vacuum
expectation values in the hidden dimensions. We present the necessary parts of
the four dimensional effective theory including moduli which describe the
embedding of the gauge bundle within the gauge group. We then present exact
cosmological solutions to the system before going on to use them to describe
the phase transition. The explicit nature of our description enables us to plot
how the gauge bosons associated with the symmetries which are broken in the
transition gain masses with time. This is in contrast to the use, for example,
of a brane collision as a modulus driven phase transition. In the course of
this work we find a number of other interesting results. We observe that the
Kahler potential of the system is given by the logarithm of the volume of the
compact space even when bundle moduli are included. We also note that the
dynamics of the gauge bundle mean that small instanton transitions are
classically forbidden for all but a set of measure zero of the initial
conditions of the system. The paper is written in such a manner that the
cosmological description of the phase transition can be read independently of
the derivation of the four dimensional theory.

  Let $G$ be a finite group of linear transformations of a finite dimensional
complex vector space $V$. To this data one can attach a family of algebras
$H_{t,c}(V,G)$, parametrized by complex numbers $t$ and conjugation invariant
functions $c$ on the set of complex reflections in $G$, which are called
rational Cherednik algebras. These algebras have been studied for over 15 years
and revealed a rich structure and deep connections with algebraic geometry,
representation theory, and combinatorics. In this paper, we define global
analogs of Cherednik algebras, attached to any smooth algebraic or analytic
variety $X$ with a finite group $G$ of automorphisms. We show that many
interesting properties of Cherednik algebras (such as the PBW theorem,
universal deformation property, relation to Calogero-Moser spaces, action on
quasiinvariants) still hold in the global case, and give several interesting
examples. Then we define the KZ functor for global Cherednik algebras, and use
it to define (in the case $\pi_2(X)\otimes \Bbb Q=0$) a flat deformation of the
orbifold fundamental group of the orbifold $X/G$, which we call the Hecke
algebra of $X/G$. This includes usual, affine, and double affine Hecke algebras
for Weyl groups, Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups, as well as many
new examples.

for all $i$ and $j$, it holds that $\Pr[y^i_j = x_j] = 1 - \eps$, independently
for all $i$ and $j$. That is, each party sees each bit correctly with
probability $1-\epsilon$, and incorrectly (flipped) with probability
$\epsilon$, independently for all bits and all parties. The parties, who cannot
communicate, wish to agree beforehand on {\em balanced} functions $f_i :
\bits^n \to \bits$ such that $\Pr[f_1(y^1) = ... = f_k(y^k)]$ is maximized. In
other words, each party wants to toss a fair coin so that the probability that
all parties have the same coin is maximized. The functions $f_i$ may be thought
of as an error correcting procedure for the source $x$.
  When $k=2,3$ no error correction is possible, as the optimal protocol is
given by $f_i(x^i) = y^i_1$. On the other hand, for large values of $k$, better
protocols exist. We study general properties of the optimal protocols and the
asymptotic behavior of the problem with respect to $k$, $n$ and $\eps$. Our

  2004",,"10.1016/j.jmps.2004.11.003",,"physics.geo-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  Frictional sliding along an interface between two identical isotropic elastic
plates under impact shear loading is investigated experimentally and
numerically. The plates are held together by a compressive stress and one plate
is subject to edge impact near the interface. The experiments exhibit both a
crack-like and a pulse-like mode of sliding. Plane stress finite element
calculations modeling the experimental configuration are carried out, with the
interface characterized by a rate and state dependent frictional law. For low
values of the initial compressive stress and impact velocity, sliding occurs in
a crack-like mode. For higher values of the initial compressive stress and/or
impact velocity, sliding takes place in a pulse-like mode. A variety of sliding
modes are obtained in the calculations depending on the impact velocity, the
initial compressive stress and the values of interface variables. One
pulse-like mode involves well-separated pulses with the pulse amplitude
increasing with propagation distance. Another pulse-like mode involves a pulse
train of essentially constant amplitude. The propagation speed of the leading
pulse (or of the tip of the crack-like sliding region) is near the longitudinal
wave speed and never less than $\sqrt{2}$ times the shear wave speed.
Supersonic trailing pulses are seen both experimentally and computationally.
The trends in the calculations are compared with those seen in the experiments.
These observations can lead to new insights into the mechanisms of earthquakes.

We then explore the relationship between the number of sites required for
accurate tree reconstruction and other model parameters - such as the number of
species, and substitution probabilities, and we describe a phase transition
that occurs when substitution probabilities exceed a critical value. In the
remainder of this paper we turn to models of character evolution where the
state space is assumed to be either infinite or very large. These models have
some relevance to certain types of genomic data (such as gene order) and here
we again investigate how many characters are required for accurate tree

situation. For an electron occupying a twofold state, we obtain both the
""magnetic-field"" (or curl-field) and the tensorial (or Yang-Mills-) field
(which is the sum of a curl and of a vector- product term). These pseudo-
fields represent the reaction of the electron on the nuclear motion via the
nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs). We find that both fields are aligned with
the orthogonal, (so called) seam directions of the ci and are zero everywhere
outside the seam, but they differ as regards the flux that they produce. In a
two-state situation, the fields are representation dependent and the values of,
e.g., the fluxes depend on the state that the electron occupies. The angular
dependence of the NACTs and the fields calculated from a general linearly
coupled model agrees with recently computed results for $C_2 H$ [A.M. Mebel, M.
Baer and S.H. Lin, J.Chem. Phys. {\bf 115} 3673 (2001)]. An
effective-Hamiltonian formalism is proposed for experimentally observing and
distinguishing between the different fields.

acquired by a time dependent wave function in a multi component system, as
excursions are made in its coordinate space. We then obtain the mean phase for
the (linear dynamic $E \otimes \epsilon$) Jahn-Teller situation in an
electronically degenerate system. We interpret the phase-change as an
observable measure of the {\it effective} nodal structure of the wave function.
