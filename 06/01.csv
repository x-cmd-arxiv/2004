Chameleon molecular clouds exhibit abundant solid methanol, although it is not
clear if the ice is associated with a disk or with the envelope. These are the
first detections of solid methanol in the circumstellar environments of
embedded young low-mass stars providing evidence that complex molecular species

advantage of this wide range of molecular tracers available within a few

data over an area of 64sq.arcmin in ELAIS N1, we find that 50%+-6% of our ERO
sample have measurable 24um flux above the 3sigma flux limit of 40uJy. This
flux limit corresponds to a SFR of 12Msun/yr at z~1. The 24um-detected EROs
have 24-to-2.2 and 24-to-0.7um flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous,
dusty sources at z>1, and an order of magnitude too red to be explained by an
infrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift.
Keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected EROs in the FLS
field suggests that most of the EROs in ELAIS N1 are probably at z~1. The mean
24um flux (167uJy) of the 24um-detected ERO sample roughly corresponds to the
total infrared luminosity of (3-10)x10^(11)Lsun at z=1-1.5, which is similar to
that of local LIRGs and ULIGs. The corresponding SFR is ~(50-170)Msun/yr. If
the time scale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 10^8yr as inferred
for the local LIRGs and ULIGs, the lower limit on the masses of these

sources in the Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS) by examining their counterparts
at 8um and R-band. The color-color diagram of 24-to-8 vs. 24-to-0.7um is
populated with 18,734 sources brighter than the 3sigma flux limit of 110uJy,
over an area of 3.7sq.degrees. The 24-to-0.7um colors of these sources span
almost 4 orders of magnitudes, while the 24-to-8um colors distribute at least
over 2 orders of magnitudes. In addition to identifying ~30% of the total
sample with infrared quiescent, mostly low redshift galaxies, we also found
that: (1) 23% of the 24um sources (~1200/sq.degrees) have very red 24-to-8 and
24-to-0.7 colors and are probably infrared luminous starbursts with
L(IR)>3x10^(11)Lsun at z>1. In particular, 13% of the sample (660/sq.degrees)
are 24um detected only, with no detectable emission in either 8um or R-band.
These sources are the candidates for being ULIRGs at z>2. (2) 2% of the sample
(85/sq.degrees) have colors similar to dust reddened AGNs, like Mrk231 at
z~0.6-3. (3) We anticipate that some of these sources with extremely red colors
may be new types of sources, since they can not be modelled with any familiar
type of spectral energy distribution. We find that 17% of the 24um sources have
no detectable optical counterparts brighter than R limit of 25.5mag. Optical
spectroscopy of these optical extremely faint 24um sources would be very
difficult, and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the Spitzer would be critical for
understanding their physical nature (Abridged).

neutron stars are featureless and in some cases (e.g., RX J1856.5-3754) well
fit by a blackbody. Such a perfect blackbody spectrum is puzzling since
radiative transport through typical neutron star atmospheres causes noticeable
deviation from blackbody. Previous studies have shown that in a strong magnetic
field, the outermost layer of the neutron star may be in a condensed solid or
liquid form because of the greatly enhanced cohesive energy of the condensed
matter. The critical temperature of condensation increases with the magnetic
field strength, and can be as high as 10^6 K (for Fe surface at B \sim 10^{13}
G or H surface at B \sim a few times 10^{14} G). Thus the thermal radiation can
directly emerge from the degenerate metallic condensed surface, without going
through a gaseous atmosphere. Here we calculate the emission properties
(spectrum and polarization) of the condensed Fe and H surfaces of magnetic
neutron stars in the regimes where such condensation may be possible. For a
smooth condensed surface, the overall emission is reduced from the blackbody by
less than a factor of 2. The spectrum exhibits modest deviation from blackbody
across a wide energy range, and shows mild absorption features associated with
the ion cyclotron frequency and the electron plasma frequency in the condensed
matter. The roughness of the solid condensate (in the Fe case) tends to
decrease the reflectivity of the surface, and make the emission spectrum even
closer to blackbody. We discuss the implications of our results for
observations of dim, isolated neutron stars and magnetars.

dE globular cluster systems' $V-I$ color with the luminosity of the host dE is
strong evidence that the globular clusters were formed within the the halos of
dEs and do not have a pre-galactic origin. Assuming the majority of dE clusters
are old, the mean globular cluster color- host galaxy luminosity correlation
implies a cluster metallicity $-$ galaxy luminosity relation of $Z_{GC} \propto
L_B^{0.22 \pm 0.05}$, which is significantly shallower than the field star
metallicity - host galaxy luminosity relationship observed in Local Group
dwarfs ($Z_{FS} \propto L^{0.4}$). The dE stellar envelopes are $0.1-0.2$
magnitudes redder in $V-I$ than their globular clusters and nuclei. This color
offset implies separate star-formation episodes within the dEs for the clusters

star-formation event in those dEs less than a Gyr ago.

the link between ultraluminous infrared galaxies and young radio galaxies. A
VLBI study of the neutral hydrogen in the nuclear regions of this object shows
that most of the gas detected close to the systemic velocity is associated with
an off-nuclear cloud (~50 to 100 pc from the radio core) with a column density
of ~10^22 T_spin/100 K) cm^(-2) and an HI mass of a few times 10^5 to 10^6
M_sun. We consider a number of possibilities to explain the results. In
particular, we discus the possibility that this cloud indicates the presence of
a rich and clumpy interstellar medium in the centre, likely left over from the
merger that triggered the activity and that this medium influences the growth
of the radio source. The location of the cloud -- at the edge of the northern
radio jet/lobe -- suggests that the radio jet might be interacting with a gas
cloud. This interaction could be responsible for bending the young radio jet.
The velocity profile of the gas is relatively broad (~150$ km/s) and we
interpret this as kinematical evidence for interaction of the radio plasma with
the cloud. We also consider the model where the cloud is part of a broader
circumnuclear structure. Only a limited region of this structure would have
sufficient background radio brightness and large enough column depth in neutral
gas to obtain detectable HI absorption against the counterjet. The VLBI study
of the neutral hydrogen in 4C12.50 suggests that HI detected near the systemic
velocity (as it is often the case in radio galaxies) may not necessarily be
connected with a circumnuclear disk or torus (as is very often assumed) but
instead could be a tracer of the large-scale medium that surrounds the active
nucleus and that may influence the growth of the young radio source.

which DFs can be represented by appropriate orbit libraries. First, by mapping
DFs of spherical gamma-models and flattened Plummer models on to the library we
show that the resulting line-of-sight velocity distributions and internal
velocity moments of the library match those directly derived from the DF to a
precision better than that of present day observational errors. Second, by
fitting libraries to the projected kinematics of the same DFs we show that the

wavelengths longer than ~25 \mum, and a cluster of stars located close to the
center of the core, but not spatially coincident with it, responsible for the
emission at shorter wavelengths. The core is approximately located at the
center of the associated molecular outflow, detected for both sources in the

luminosities of ~10^{3} L_{\odot}. The outflows parameters are consistent with

the hypothesis that in these sources the luminosity is dominated by accretion

diffusive acceleration at shocks internal to the dynamic ultrarelativistic
outflow. This paper explores expectations for burst emission spectra arising
from shock acceleration theory in the limit of particles cooling much slower
than their acceleration. Parametric fits to burst spectra obtained by the
Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) are explored for the cases of the
synchrotron, inverse Compton and synchrotron self-Compton radiation mechanisms,
using a linear combination of thermal and non-thermal electron populations.
These fits demand that the preponderance of electrons that are responsible for
the prompt emission reside in an intrinsically non-thermal population, strongly
contrasting particle distributions obtained from acceleration simulations. This
implies a potential conflict for acceleration scenarios where the non-thermal
electrons are drawn directly from a thermal gas. It is also found that the CGRO
data preclude effective spectroscopic discrimination between the synchrotron
and inverse Compton mechanisms. This situation may be resolved with future
missions probing gamma-ray bursts, namely Swift and GLAST. However, the
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum is characteristically too broad near
the $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak to viably account for bursts such as GRB 910601, GRB
910814 and GRB 990123. It is concluded that the SSC mechanism may be generally
incompatible with differential burst spectra steeper than around $E^{-2.5}$
above the peak, unless the synchrotron component is strongly self-absorbed.

f_{NL} using non-Gaussian CMB maps generated by the method described in
(Liguori, Matarrese and Moscardini 2003). This procedure to obtain non-Gaussian
maps differs significantly from the method used in previous works on estimation
of f_{NL}. Nevertheless, using spherical wavelets, we find results in very good
agreement with (Mukherjee and Wang 2004), showing that the two ways of
generating primordial non-Gaussian maps give equivalent results. Moreover, we
introduce a new method for estimating the non-linear coupling constant from CMB
observations by using the local curvature of the temperature fluctuation field.
We present both Bayesian credible regions (assuming a flat prior) and proper
(frequentist) confidence intervals on f_{NL}, and discuss the relation between
the two approaches. The Bayesian approach tends to yield lower error bars than
the frequentist approach, suggesting that a careful analysis of the different
interpretations is needed. Using this method, we estimate
f_{NL}=-10^{+270}_{-260} at the 2\sigma level (Bayesian) and
f_{NL}=-10^{+310}_{-270} (frequentist). Moreover, we find that the wavelet and
the local curvature approaches, which provide similar error bars, yield
approximately uncorrelated estimates of f_{NL} and therefore, as advocated in
(Cabella et al. 2004), the estimates may be combined to reduce the error bars.
In this way, we obtain f_{NL}=-5\pm 85 and f_{NL}=-5\pm 175 at the 1\sigma and
2\sigma level respectively using the frequentist approach.

weak coupling, has remained quite elusive. Aspects of this problem are
considered in the present paper where a non-perturbative local moment approach

$f$-level asymmetry and lattice type.A rich description arises, encompassing
both coherent Fermi liquid behaviour at low-$\omega^{\prime}$ and the crossover

creates a super-current in the plane of the structure. In an isotropic case,

changes of the relative position of the dot addition energies and the Fermi
level of the leads. Here we discuss the two limiting cases: weak and strong
coupling in the tunneling Hamiltonian. In the latter case Kondo resonant
conductance can emerge at low temperature in a Coulomb blockade valley. We give
a pedagogical approach to the single-channel Kondo physics at equilibrium and
review the Nozieres scattering picture of the correlated fixed point. We
emphasize the effect of an applied magnetic field and show how an orbital Kondo
effect can take place in vertical quantum dots tuned both to an even and to an
odd number of electrons at a level crossing. We extend the approach to the
two-channel overscreened Kondo case and discuss recent proposals for detecting
the non-Fermi liquid fixed point which could be reached at strong coupling.

reflection at a superconductor modifies the excitation spectrum of a quantum
dot. The emphasis is on two-dimensional impurity-free structures in which the
classical dynamics is chaotic. Such Andreev billiards differ in a fundamental
way from their non-superconducting counterparts. Most notably, the difference
between chaotic and integrable classical dynamics shows up already in the level
density, instead of only in the level--level correlations. A chaotic billiard
has a gap in the spectrum around the Fermi energy, while integrable billiards
have a linearly vanishing density of states. The excitation gap E_gap
corresponds to a time scale h/E_gap which is classical (h-independent, equal to
the mean time t_dwell between Andreev reflections) if t_dwell is sufficiently
large. There is a competing quantum time scale, the Ehrenfest time t_E, which
depends logarithmically on h. Two phenomenological theories provide a
consistent description of the t_E-dependence of the gap, given qualitatively by
E_gap min(h/t_dwell,h/t_E). The analytical predictions have been tested by
computer simulations but not yet experimentally.

varies exponentially with the free-energy barrier to nucleation, and so is
highly sensitive to variations in this barrier. In practice, very few systems
are absolutely pure, there are typically some impurities present which are
rather poorly characterised. These interact with the nucleus, causing the
barrier to vary, and so must be taken into account. Here the impurity-nucleus
interactions are modelled by random variables. The rate then has the same form
as the partition function of Derrida's Random Energy Model, and as in this
model there is a regime in which the behaviour is non-self-averaging.
Non-self-averaging nucleation is nucleation with a rate that varies
significantly from one realisation of the random variables to another. In
experiment this corresponds to variation in the nucleation rate from one sample
to another. General analytic expressions are obtained for the crossover from a
self-averaging to a non-self-averaging rate of nucleation.

heat equation. This DPD solid with transport based on collisional transfer
(high density mechanism) is complementary to the Lorentz gas with only kinetic
transport (low density mechanism). Combination of both models covers the
qualitative behavior of transport properties of classical fluids over the full
density range. The heat diffusivity is calculated using a mean field theory,
leading to a linear density dependence of this transport coefficient, which is
exact at high densities. Subleading density corrections are obtained as well.
At lower densities the model has a conductivity threshold below which heat
conduction is absent. The observed threshold is explained in terms of
percolation diffusion on a random proximity network. The geometrical structure
of this network is the same as in continuum percolation of completely
overlapping spheres, but the dynamics on this network differs from continuum
percolation diffusion. Furthermore, the kinetic theory for DPD is extended to
the generalized hydrodynamic regime, where the wave number dependent decay

geoneutrinos, which opens a window on the differential radionuclide
distribution. We develop the general formalism for the neutrino angular
distribution, and we present the inverse transformation which recovers the
terrestrial radioisotope distribution given a measurement of the neutrino
angular distribution. Thus, geoneutrinos not only allow a means to image the
Earth's interior, but offering a direct measure of the radioactive Earth, both
(1) revealing the Earth's inner structure as probed by radionuclides, and (2)
allowing for a complete determination of the radioactive heat generation as a
function of radius. We present the geoneutrino angular distribution for the
favored Earth model which has been used to calculate geoneutrino flux. In this
model the neutrino generation is dominated by decays in the Earth's mantle and
crust; this leads to a very ``peripheral'' angular distribution, in which 2/3
of the neutrinos come from angles > 60 degrees away from the downward vertical.
We note the possibility of that the Earth's core contains potassium; different
geophysical predictions lead to strongly varying, and hence distinguishable,
central intensities (< 30 degrees from the downward vertical). Other
uncertainties in the models, and prospects for observation of the geoneutrino
angular distribution, are briefly discussed. We conclude by urging the
development and construction of antineutrino experiments with angular
sensitivity. (Abstract abridged.)

anticipated in hep-th/0101013, supports the idea that the cascading gauge
theory is on the baryonic branch, i.e. the U(1)_B global symmetry is broken by
expectation values of baryonic operators. We also find a massless scalar
glueball, which is a superpartner of the pseudo-scalar. This scalar mode is a
mixture of an NS-NS 2-form and a metric perturbation of the warped deformed

is the size of the black hole relative to the size of the compact dimension. We
set up a general procedure for an arbitrary order in the perturbation series
based on an asymptotic matched expansion between two coordinate patches: the
near horizon zone and the asymptotic zone. The procedure is ordinary
perturbation expansion in each zone, where additionally some boundary data
comes from the other zone, and so the procedure alternates between the zones.
It can be viewed as a dialogue of multipoles where the black hole changes its
shape (mass multipoles) in response to the field (multipoles) created by its
periodic ""mirrors"", and that in turn changes its field and so on. We present
the leading correction to the full metric including the first correction to the
area-temperature relation, the leading term for black hole eccentricity and the
""Archimedes effect"". The next order corrections will appear in a sequel. On the
way we determine independently the static perturbations of the Schwarzschild
black hole in dimension d>=5, where the system of equations can be reduced to
""a master equation"" - a single ordinary differential equation. The solutions

This is a survey paper on exceptional holonomy, in two parts.
  Part I introduces the exceptional holonomy groups, and explains constructions
for compact 7- and 8-manifolds with holonomy G2 and Spin(7). The simplest such
constructions work by using techniques from complex geometry and Calabi-Yau
analysis to resolve the singularities of a torus orbifold T^7/G or T^8/G, for G
a finite group preserving a flat G2 or Spin(7)-structure on T^7 or T^8. There
are also more complicated constructions which begin with a Calabi-Yau manifold
or orbifold.
  Part II discusses the calibrated submanifolds of G2 and Spin(7)-manifolds:
associative 3-folds and coassociative 4-folds for G2, and Cayley 4-folds for
Spin(7). We explain the general theory, following Harvey and Lawson, and the
known examples. Finally we describe the deformation theory of compact
calibrated submanifolds, following McLean.

close to Poissonian and have been subjected to widely different physical

model whose physical basis is equal population in phase space which implies
equilibrium statistics. We found distributions of single element are to a good
approximation Poissonian, and such result is attributed to the small emission
probability of a given IMF among all the possible channels. We also found
significant deviation from Poisson distribution for a range of IMFs, and
suggest strong correlations as an explanation. Systematics of the multiplicity
distributions are explored in both one component and two component models. In
one component model, sudden changes for the multiplicity distributions are
found at the phase transition region. In two component model, the multiplicity
distributions have more subtleties. Results from the current model are compared
with available data, and good agreements are found. New signals for the
multi-particle correlations are also suggested.

due to subdiffusion, while the appearance of metaphases is determined by
superdiffusion.

  profiles in proteins","13 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables","Proteins 58, 22-30 (2005)",,,"q-bio.BM",,"  With the aim to study the relationship between protein sequences and their
native structures, we adopt vectorial representations for both sequence and
structure. The structural representation is based on the Principal Eigenvector
of the fold's contact matrix (PE). As recently shown, the latter encodes
sufficient information for reconstructing the whole contact matrix. The
sequence is represented through a Hydrophobicity Profile (HP), using a
generalized hydrophobicity scale that we obtain from the principal eigenvector
of a residue-residue interaction matrix and denote it as interactivity scale.
Using this novel scale, we define the optimal HP of a protein fold, and
predict, by means of stability arguments, that it is strongly correlated with
the PE of the fold's contact matrix. This prediction is confirmed through an
evolutionary analysis, which shows that the PE correlates with the HP of each
individual sequence adopting the same fold and, even more strongly, with the
average HP of this set of sequences. Thus, protein sequences evolve in such a
way that their average HP is close to the optimal one, implying that neutral
evolution can be viewed as a kind of motion in sequence space around the
optimal HP. Our results indicate that the correlation coefficient between
N-dimensional vectors constitutes a natural metric in the vectorial space in
which we represent both protein sequences and protein structures, which we call
Vectorial Protein Space. In this way, we define a unified framework for
sequence to sequence, sequence to structure, and structure to structure
alignments. We show that the interactivity scale is nearly optimal both for the
comparison of sequences with sequences and sequences with structures.

by a bath of many spins 1/2. By carefully adjusting parameters, the dynamical
regime of the bath has been varied from quantum chaos to regular, while all
other dynamical characteristics have been kept practically intact. We
explicitly demonstrate that for a many-body quantum bath, the onset of quantum
chaos leads to significantly faster and stronger decoherence compared to an
equivalent non-chaotic bath. Moreover, the non-diagonal elements of the
system's density matrix decay differently for chaotic and non-chaotic baths.
Therefore, knowledge of the basic parameters of the bath (strength of the
system-bath interaction, bath's spectral density of states) is not always
sufficient, and much finer details of the bath's dynamics can strongly affect
the decoherence process.

Young's double slit experiments. A photon passing through the boundary between
two media, in which a photon travels at different velocities, undergoes a
momentum change according to the law of conservation of momentum. The momentum
of the photon is transferred locally to the medium, and the boundary between
the media receives stress, which determines the photon trajectory. An
experiment is performed using a crystal plate that can transform the stress to
electric charge. We are able to detect the electric charge after the detection
of the photon on the screen, and control the sensitivity of photon detection.
By means of this proposed experiment it is determined whether or not an attempt
to detect the ""which way"" of photon travel destroys the interference patterns.

decoherence of superpositions in energy, corresponding to a discretization of
time at the Planck scale. At first sight the proposal seems amenable to
experimental verification with methods from quantum optics and atomic physics.
However, we argue that the predicted decoherence is unobservable in such
experiments if it acts globally on the whole experimental setup. This is
related to the unobservability of the global phase in interference. We also
show how local energy decoherence, which acts separately on system and phase
reference, could be detected with remarkable sensitivity and over a wide range
of length scales by long-distance Ramsey interferometry with metastable atomic
states. The sensitivity of the experiments can be further enhanced using
multi-atom entanglement.
