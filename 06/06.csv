from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These objects were selected for their
intermediate redshift (1.2<z<1.8), placing MgII and UV FeII in the optical band
pass, relatively narrow MgII lines, and moderately good signal-to-noise-ratio
spectra. Using a maximum likelihood analysis, we discovered that there is a
significant dispersion in the FeII/MgII ratios in the sample. Using
simulations, we demonstrate that this range, and corresponding correlation
between FeII equivalent width and FeII/MgII ratio, are primarily a consequence
of a larger dispersion of FeII equivalent width (EW) relative to MgII EW. This
larger dispersion in FeII EW could be a consequence of a range in iron
abundance, or in a range of FeII excitation. The latter possibility is
supported by evidence that objects with weak (zero) CII]\lambda 2325 equivalent
width are likely to have large FeII/MgII ratios. We discuss physical effects
that could produce a range of FeII/MgII ratio.

  Inc. New York",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This work develops and explores a quantum-based theory which enables the
nature and origin of cold dark matter (CDM) to be understood without need to
introduce exotic particles. The quantum approach predicts the existence of
certain macroscopic quantum structures that are WIMP-like even when occupied by
traditional baryonic particles. These structures function as dark matter
candidates for CDM theory on large scales where it has been most successful,
and retain the potential to yield observationally compliant predictions on
galactic cluster and sub-cluster scales. Relatively pure, high angular
momentum, eigenstate solutions obtained from Schrodinger's equation in weak
gravity form the structural basis. They have no classical analogue, and
properties radically different from those of traditional localised matter
(whose eigenstate spectra contain negligible quantities of such states).
Salient features include radiative lifetimes that can exceed the age of the
universe, energies and 'sizes' consistent with galactic halos, and negligible
interaction rates with radiation and macroscopic galactic objects. This
facilitates the formation of sparsely populated macroscopic quantum structures
that are invisible and stable. Viable structure formation scenarios are based
on the seed potential wells of primordial black holes formed at the e+/e- phase
transition. The structures can potentially produce suitable internal density
distributions and have capacity to accommodate the required amount of halo dark
matter. The formation scenarios show that it is possible to incorporate
structures into universal evolutionary scenarios without significantly
compromising the results of WMAP or the measurements of elemental BBN ratios.

low temperature tetragonal structure with $c/a = 0.94$. This structure cannot
be derived from the parent L2$_1$ structure by a simple homogeneous strain
associated with the soft elastic constant $C'$. In order to stabilise the
tetragonal phase, one has to take into account shuffles of atoms, which form a
wave-like pattern of atomic displacements with a well defined period
(modulation). While the modulation is related to the soft acoustic [110]-TA$_2$
phonon mode observed in Ni$_2$MnGa, we obtain additional atomic shuffles, which
are related to acoustic-optical coupling of the phonons in Ni$_2$MnGa. In
addition, we have simulated an off-stoichiometric systems, in which 25 % of Mn
atoms are replaced by Ni. The energy of this structure also exhibits a local
minimum at $c/a = 0.94$. This allows us to conclude that both shuffles and
atomic disorder stabilize the $c/a = 0.94$ structure. In both cases the
stability seems to be associated with a dip in the minority-spin density of
states (DOS) at the Fermi level, being related to the formation of hybrid
states of Ni-\textit{d} and Ga-\textit{p} minority-spin orbitals.

semi-microscopic anisotropic three-dimensional vector XY model of stacked
copper-oxide layers with adjustable parameters representing microscopic
in-plane and out-of-plane phase stiffnesses. The model captures the layered

we accommodate inhomogeneous charge distribution among planes characterized by
the charge imbalance coefficient $R$ being the function of number of layers
$n$. By making a physically justified assumption regarding the doping

linked to an additional discrete degree of freedom, chirality, which is not
present on rectangular lattices, nor in ferromagnets. However, the theoretical
as well as experimental situation is discussed controversially, and generic
scaling without universality has been proposed as an alternative scenario. Here
we present a careful investigation of the zero-field critical behaviour of
RbNiCl$_3$, a stacked-triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet with very small
Ising anisotropy. From linear birefringence experiments we determine the
specific heat exponent $\alpha$ as well as the critical amplitude ratio
$A^+/A^-$. Our high-resolution measurements point to a single second order
phase transition with standard Heisenberg critical behaviour, contrary to all
theoretical predictions. From a supplementary neutron diffraction study we can
exclude a structural phase transition at T$_N$. We discuss our results in the
context of other available experimental results on RbNiCl$_3$ and related
compounds. We arrive at a simple intuitive explanation which may be relevant
for other discrepancies observed in the critical behaviour of
stacked-triangular antiferromagnets. In RbNiCl$_3$ the ordering of the
chirality is suppressed by strong spin fluctuations, yielding to a different
phase diagram, as compared to e.g.\@ CsNiCl$_3$, where the Ising anisotropy
prevents these fluctuations.

which we call ""the curved hexagonal packings"". The curved hexagonal packing of
7 disks (k = 1, m(1)=1) is well known and the one of 19 disks (k = 2, m(2)=1)
has been previously conjectured to be optimal. New curved hexagonal packings of
37, 61, and 91 disks (k = 3, 4, and 5, m(3)=1, m(4)=3, and m(5)=12) were the
densest we obtained on a computer using a so-called ""billiards"" simulation
algorithm. A curved hexagonal packing pattern is invariant under a 60 degree
rotation. For k tending to infinity, the density (covering fraction) of curved
hexagonal packings tends to pi*pi/12. The limit is smaller than the density of
the known optimum disk packing in the infinite plane. We found disk
configurations that are denser than curved hexagonal packings for 127, 169, and
217 disks (k = 6, 7, and 8). In addition to new packings for h(k) disks, we
present new packings we found for h(k)+1 and h(k)-1 disks for k up to 5, i.e.,
for 36, 38, 60, 62, 90, and 92 disks. The additional packings show the
``tightness'' of the curved hexagonal pattern for k =< 5: deleting a disk does
not change the optimum packing and its quality significantly, but adding a disk
causes a substantial rearrangement in the optimum packing and substantially
decreases the quality.

formula to calculate the Welschinger invariants of real toric Del Pezzo

expresses the Welschinger invariants via the total multiplicity of certain
tropical curves (non-Archimedean amoebas) passing through generic
configurations of points, and then via the total multiplicity of some lattice
path in the convex lattice polygon associated with a given surface. We also
present the results of computation of Welschinger invariants, obtained jointly

paper the more general nil-groups and nil-elements in groups. All these notions
are related to nilpotent groups and nilpotent radicals in groups. These notions
generate problems which are parallel to Burnside problems for periodic groups.
  The first three theorems of the paper are devoted to nil-groups and Engel
groups, while the other results are connected with the further generalizations.
These generalizations extend the theory to solvable groups and solvable
radicals in groups. The paper has two parts. The first one (sections 2-4) deals
with old ideas, while the second one (sections 5-9) is devoted to
generalizations.

$H$ from $\Theta$ one can consider algebraic geometry in $\Theta$ over $H$. We
consider also a special categorical invariant $K_\Theta (H)$ of this geometry.
The classical algebraic geometry deals with the variety $\Theta=Com-P$ of all
associative and commutative algebras over the ground field of constants $P$. An
algebra $H$ in this setting is an extension of the ground field $P$. Geometry
in groups is related to varieties $\Grp$ and $\Grp-G$, where $G$ is a group of
constants. The case $\Grp -F$ where $F$ is a free group, is related to Tarski's
problems devoted to logic of a free group. he described general insight on
algebraic geometry in different varieties of algebras inspires some new
problems in algebra and algebraic geometry. The problems of such kind
determine, to a great extent, the content of universal algebraic geometry. We
start with the short overview of main definitions and results and then consider
the list of unsolved problems.
