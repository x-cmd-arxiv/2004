activity in the nucleus and disk, respectively, of the nearly edge-on superwind
galaxy NGC 4666. Spatially unresolved emission is detected by BeppoSAX only at
energies <10 keV, whereas spatially resolved emission from the whole disk is
detected by XMM-Newton. A prominent (EW ~ 1-2 keV) emission line at ~6.4 keV is
detected by both instruments. From the XMM-Newton data alone the line is
spectrally localized at E ~ 6.42 +/- 0.03 keV, and seems to be spatially
concentrated in the nuclear region of NGC 4666. This, together with the
presence of a flat (Gamma ~ 1.3) continuum in the nuclear region, suggests the
existence of a strongly absorbed (i.e., Compton-thick) AGN, whose intrinsic
2-10 keV luminosity is estimated to be L_{2-10} > 2 x 10^{41} erg/s. At
energies <1 keV the integrated (BeppoSAX) spectrum is dominated by a ~0.25 keV
thermal gas component distributed throughout the disk (resolved by XMM-Newton).
At energies ~2-10 keV, the integrated spectrum is dominated by a steep (G > 2)
power-law (PL) component. The latter emission is likely due to unresolved
sources with luminosity L ~ 10^{38} - 10^{39} erg/s that are most likely
accreting binaries (with BH masses <8 M_sun). Such binaries, which are known to
dominate the X-ray point-source luminosity in nearby star-forming galaxies,
have Gamma ~ 2 PL spectra in the relevant energy range. A Gamma ~ 1.8 PL
contribution from Compton scattering of (the radio-emitting) relativistic
electrons by the ambient FIR photons may add a truly diffuse component to the
2-10 keV emission.

show that in each new cycle the universe expands for longer and to a larger

dwarf novae in quiescence is released mainly in the ultraviolet (UV) as the
second component commonly identified in the far ultraviolet (FUV) as the
""accretion belt"".
  We present the well-studied SU UMa-type system VW Hyi in detail as a
prototype for such a scenario. We consider detailed multiwavelength
observations and in particular the recent FUSE observations of VW Hyi which
confirm the presence of a second component (the ""accretion belt"") in the FUV
spectrum of VW Hyi in quiescence. The temperature (50,000K) and rotational
velocity (> 3,000km/s) of this second FUV component are entirely consistent
with the optically thick region (tau = 1) located just at the outer edge of
optically thin boundary layer in the simulations of Popham (1999).
  This second component contributes 20% of the FUV flux, therefore implying a
boundary layer luminosity: $L_{BL} = 2 \times (0.2 \times L_{UV} + L_{X-ray}) =
0.6 \times L_{disc}$, while the theory (Klu\'zniak 1987) predicts, for the
rotation rate of VW Hyi's WD, $L_{BL} \approx 0.77 L_{disc}$. The remaining
accretion energy ($<0.1 L_{acc}$) is apparently advected into the star as
expected for optically thin advection dominated boundary layers. This scenario
is consistent with the recent simultaneous X-ray and UV observations of VW Hyi
by (Pandel, C\'ordova & Howell 2003), from which we deduced here that the alpha
viscosity parameter in the boundary layer region must be as small as $\alpha
\approx 0.004$.

Flexion signal increases on small scales, this is ideally suited to
galaxy-galaxy lensing. We develop an inversion technique based on the

H_2 in M83 and NGC 5253, and set upper limits on the H_2 column density in the
other galaxies. Conservative upper limits on the mass of molecular gas detected
with FUSE are many orders of magnitude lower than the H_2 mass inferred from CO
emission. This indicates that almost all of the H_2 is in the form of clouds
with N(H_2)>10^20 cm^-2 that are opaque to far-UV light and therefore cannot be
probed with far-UV absorption measurements. The far-UV continuum visible in the
FUSE spectra passes between the dense clouds, which have a covering factor <1.
The complex observational biases related to varying extinction across the
extended UV emission in the FUSE apertures prevent an unambiguous
characterization of the diffuse H_2 in these starbursts. However, the evidence
is suggestive that there is less H_2 in the diffuse interstellar medium between
the dense clouds compared to similarly reddened sight lines in the Milky Way.
This holds with the expectation that the destructive UV radiation field is
stronger in starbursts. However, previous UV observations of these starbursts
have shown that there is reddening caused by the diffuse interstellar medium.
This suggests that while diffuse H_2 may be destroyed in the starburst, dust
still exists.

summed contributions of groups of sources within the beam. The counts of bright
intensity peaks are therefore shifted to higher flux levels compared to the
counts of individual sources detected with high-resolution instruments. If the
beam-width corresponds a sizable fraction of the clustering size, as in the
case of Planck/HFI, one actually detects the fluxes of clumps of sources. We
argue that the distribution of clump luminosities can be modelled in terms of
the two- and three-point correlation functions, and apply our formalism to the
Planck/HFI 850 micron surveys. The effect on counts is found to be large and
sensitive also to the evolution of the three-point correlation function; in the
extreme case that the latter function is redshift-independent, the source
confusion due to clustering keeps being important above the canonical 5*sigma
detection limit. Detailed simulations confirm the reliability of our approach.
As the ratio of the beam-width to the clustering angular size decreases, the
observed fluxes approach those of the brightest sources in the beam and the
clump formalism no longer applies. However, simulations show that also in the
case of the Herschel/SPIRE 500 micron survey the enhancement of the bright
source counts due to clustering is important.

Lee (1984). At 1.2 mm our values are a factor 1.5 higher than this model. Our
estimates are more closely aligned with recent measurements carried out in the

planets are forward scattering and rings are backward scattering. Images of the
planet with or without rings are simulated and used to calculate the
disk-averaged luminosity varying along the orbit, that is, a light curve is

Saturn (without rings) make a substantial difference in the shape of their
light curves. Saturn-size rings increase the apparent luminosity of the planet
by a factor of 2-3 for a wide range of geometries. Rings produce asymmetric
light curves that are distinct from the light curve of the planet without
rings. If radial velocity data are available for the planet, the effect of the
ring on the light curve can be distinguished from effects due to orbital
eccentricity. Non-ringed planets on eccentric orbits produce light curves with
maxima shifted relative to the position of the maximum planet's phase. Given
radial velocity data, the amount of the shift restricts the planet's unknown
orbital inclination and therefore its mass. Combination of radial velocity data
and a light curve for a non-ringed planet on an eccentric orbit can also be
used to constrain the surface scattering properties of the planet. To summarize
our results for the detectability of exoplanets in reflected light, we present
a chart of light curve amplitudes of non-ringed planets for different
eccentricities, inclinations, and the viewing azimuthal angles of the observer.

have a slightly higher, but still very mild, star-formation activity. The
ISOCAM-selected cluster galaxies appear to be an unbiased subsample of the
overall cluster population. If A2218 is undergoing a merger, as suggested by
some optical and X-ray analyses, then this merger does not seem to affect the
mid-infrared properties of its galaxies.
  The SEDs of most ISOCAM-selected field sources are best fit by models with
significant ongoing (and recent) star formation, resembling those of massive
star-forming spirals or (post)starburst galaxies. Their median SFR is 22 solar
masses per year. Eight of the 14 field sources are Luminous IR Galaxies.

al. (2002, based on 57 stars). Increasing the sample size does not lead to a
lower rms value. It is shown that the residuals do not correlate with

diameters are compared to those predicted by Cohen et al. (1999) for 45 stars

excitation mechanisms of the H2 and [FeII] gas in a sample of AGN. The H2 lines
are unresolved in all objects in which they were detected while the [FeII]
lines have widths implying gas velocities of up to 650 km/s. This suggests
that, very likely, the H2 and [FeII] emission does not originate from the same
parcel of gas. Molecular H2 were detected in 90% of the sample, including PG
objects, indicating detectavel amounts of molecular material even in objects
with low levels of circumnuclear starburst activity. The data favors thermal
excitation for the H2 lines. Indeed, in NGC3227, Mrk766, NGC4051 and NGC4151,
the molecular emission is found to be purely thermal. This result is also
confirmed by the rather similar vibrational and rotational temperatures in the
objects for which they were derived. [FeII] lines are detected in all of the

[FeII] by the active nucleus, but in Mrk 766 it implies a stellar origin. A
correlation between H2/Br-gamma and [FeII]/Pa-beta is found. We confirm that it
is a useful diagnostic tool in the NIR to separate emitting line objects by
their level of nuclear activity. X-ray excitation models are able to explain
the observed H2 and part of the [FeII] emission. Most likely, a combination of
X-ray heating, shocks driven by the radio jet, and circumnuclear star formation
contributes, in different proportions, to the H2 and [FeII] emission. In most
of our spectra, the [FeII] 1.257mu/1.644mu ratio is found to be 30% lower than

been extracted from remote observations of impact craters on planetary
surfaces. However, the nature of the geophysical impact events is that they are
non-reproducible. Moreover, their scale is enormous and direct observations are
not possible. Therefore, we choose an alternate and of course downscaled
experimental approach in order to guarantee reproducible results: We prepare
very fine sand in a well defined and fully decompactified state by letting gas
bubble through it. After turning off the gas stream, we let a steel ball fall
on the sand. The series of events in the experiments and corresponding discrete
particle simulations is as follows: On impact of the ball, sand is blown away
in all directions (""splash"") and an impact crater forms. When this cavity
collapses, a granular jet emerges and is driven straight into the air. A second
jet goes downwards into the air bubble entrained during the process, thus
pushing surface material deep into the ground. The air bubble rises slowly
towards the surface, causing a granular eruption. In addition to the
experiments and the discrete particle simulations we present a simple continuum
theory to account for the void collapse leading to the formation of the upward
and downward jets. We show that the phenomenon is robust and even works for
oblique impacts: the upward jet is then shooting backwards, in the direction
where the projectile came from.

For a realistic tip shape, the domain nucleation process is first order in

strongly dependent on the relative values of the inter-site electron-electron

sample fabricated in the same gas environment using the micron-sized magnesium

Nano-MgB2 reaches 1.7 g/cm3 with a crystal porosity structure less than a
micrometer, as determined by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images,
while the Micro-MgB2 has a much more porous structure with corresponding

sintering temperature, is a crucial factor for the formation of high density
MgB2 sample, even at the temperature much lower than that of the Mg melting,
650 C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows a good MgB2 phase with small
amount of MgO and Mg and the transition temperature, TC, of the Nano-MgB2 was
determined as 39 K by the temperature dependent magnetization measurement

akin to the merging of different spanning trees to a set of destinations, has
been argued to introduce uncontrolled sampling biases that might produce
statistical properties of the sampled graph which sharply differ from the
original ones. Here we explore these biases and provide a statistical analysis
of their origin. We derive a mean-field analytical approximation for the
probability of edge and vertex detection that exploits the role of the number
of sources and targets and allows us to relate the global topological
properties of the underlying network with the statistical accuracy of the
sampled graph. In particular we find that the edge and vertex detection
probability is depending on the betweenness centrality of each element. This
allows us to show that shortest path routed sampling provides a better
characterization of underlying graphs with scale-free topology. We complement
the analytical discussion with a throughout numerical investigation of
simulated mapping strategies in different network models. We show that sampled
graphs provide a fair qualitative characterization of the statistical
properties of the original networks in a fair range of different strategies and
exploration parameters. The numerical study also allows the identification of
intervals of the exploration parameters that optimize the fraction of nodes and
edges discovered in the sampled graph. This finding might hint the steps toward
more efficient mapping strategies.

Conformally coupled quintessence models are the simplest ones compatible with

approximately parametrized in terms of a few quantities. As a result, CP
violation in the $B$ system allows one not only to detect the presence of new
physics (NP), but also to measure its parameters. This will allow a partial
identification of the NP, before its production at high-energy colliders. In
this paper, we examine three methods for measuring NP parameters. The first
uses a technique involving both $\btos$ and $\btod$ penguin B decays. Depending
on which pair of decays is used, the theoretical error is in the range 5--15%.
The second involves a comparison of $B\to \pi K$ and $B\to\pi\pi$ decays.
Although the theoretical error is large ($\gsim 25%$), the method can be
performed now, with presently-available data. The third is via a time-dependent
angular analysis of $\bvv$ decays. In this case, there is no theoretical error,
but the technique is experimentally challenging, and the method applies only to
those NP models whose weak phase is universal to all NP operators. A reliable
identification of the NP will involve the measurement of the NP parameters in
many different ways, and with as many B decay modes as possible, so that it
will be important to use all of these methods.

equation for the SU(N_c) gauge theory with N_f massless flavors is given by the
truncated Kaluza-Klein effective theory and hence has a nontrivial ultraviolet
fixed point (UVFP). We find the critical line in the parameter space of two
couplings, the gauge coupling and the four-fermion coupling, which is similar
to that of the gauged NJL model with fixed (walking) gauge coupling in four
dimensions. It is shown that in the presence of such walking gauge interactions
the four-fermion interactions become ``nontrivial'' even in higher dimensions,
similarly to the four-dimensional gauged NJL model. Such a nontriviality holds
only in the restricted region of the critical line (``nontrivial window'') with
the gauge coupling larger than a non-vanishing value (``marginal triviality
(MT)'' point), in contrast to the four-dimensional case where such a
nontriviality holds for all regions of the critical line except for the pure
NJL point. In the nontrivial window the renormalized effective potential yields
a nontrivial interaction which is conformal invariant. The exisitence of the
nontrivial window implies ``cutoff insensitivity'' of the physics prediction in
spite of the ultraviolet dominance of the dynamics. In the formal limit D -> 4,
the nontrivial window coincides with the known condition of the nontriviality
of the four-dimensional gauged NJL model, $9/(2N_c) < N_f - N_c < 9/2 N_c$.

explain the vanishing of the 4D effective cosmological constant, due to the
automatic relation between the deficit angle and the brane tension. To
investigate whether this cancellation happens dynamically, and within the
context of a realistic cosmology, we study a codimension-two braneworld with
spherical extra dimensions compactified by magnetic flux. Assuming Einstein
gravity, we show that when the brane contains matter with an arbitrary equation
of state, the 4D metric components are not regular at the brane, unless the
brane has nonzero thickness. We construct explicit 6D solutions with thick
branes, treating the brane matter as a perturbation, and find that the universe
expands consistently with standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology.
The relation between the brane tension and the bulk deficit angle becomes
$\Delta=2\pi G_6(\rho-3 p)$ for a general equation of state. However, this
relation does not imply a self-tuning of the effective 4D cosmological constant
to zero; perturbations of the brane tension in a static solution lead to
deSitter or anti-deSitter braneworlds. Our results thus confirm other recent
work showing that codimension-two braneworlds in nonsupersymmetric Einstein
gravity do not lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant, but
they leave open the possibility that supersymmetric versions can be compatible
with self-tuning.

this duality group was first noted by Witten to be the mapping class group of a

that acts faithfully on gauge couplings. This quotient group contains the
affine Weyl group of $\hat{A}_{n-1}$, $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. In
fact there are $n$ non-commuting $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ subgroups, related to each
other by conjugation using the $\mathbb{Z}_n$. When supersymmetry is broken to
$\mathcal{N}=1$ by masses for the adjoint chiral superfields, an RG flow ensues
which is believed to terminate at a CFT in the infrared. We find the explicit

special attention to when the sum of the masses is non-zero. In the
$\mathcal{N}=1$ CFT, Seiberg duality acts non-trivially on both gauge couplings

the $\mathcal{N}=2$ parent theory. We conjecture the action of S-duality in the
CFT based on our results for small mass deformations. We also consider
non-conformal deformations of these $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories. The cascading RG
flows that ensue are a one-parameter generalization of those found by Klebanov
and Strassler and by Cachazo {\it et. al.}. The universality exhibited by these
flows is shown to be a simple consequence of paths generated by the action of
the affine Weyl group.

determined by the choice of the metric. The formulas for computing the
curvature in terms of components of the metric, in isothermal coordinates,
involve the Laplacian operator and therefore, the problem of finding a
Riemannian metric for a given curvature form may be viewed as a potential
theory problem. This problem has, generally speaking, a multitude of solutions.
To specify the solution uniquely, we ask that the metric have the mean value
property for harmonic functions with respect to some given point. This means
that we assume that the surface is simply connected and that it has a smooth
boundary. In terms of the so-called metric potential, we are looking for a
unique smooth solution to a nonlinear fourth order elliptic partial
differential equation with second order Cauchy data given on the boundary. We
find a simple condition on the curvature form which ensures that there exists a
smooth mean value surface solution. It reads: the curvature form plus half the
curvature form for the hyperbolic plane (with the same coordinates) should be
$\le0$. The same analysis leads to results on the question of whether the
canonical divisors in weighted Bergman spaces over the unit disk have
extraneous zeros. Numerical work suggests that the above condition on the
curvature form is essentially sharp.
  Our problem is in spirit analogous to the classical Minkowski problem, where
the sphere supplies the chart coordinates via the Gauss map.

extremality methods -- the corresponding best possible pointwise estimates of
$\psi''(z)/\psi'(z)$ for $\psi\in\Sigma$. It was perhaps surprising that this
time, the expressions involve elliptic integrals. Here, we obtain the area-type

the harmonic content of the periodic forcing function. Our approach relies on
the crucial influence of resonant triad interactions coupling pairs of critical
standing wave modes with damped, spatio-temporally resonant modes. Under the
assumption of weak damping and forcing, we perform a symmetry-based analysis
that reveals the damped modes most relevant for pattern selection, and how the
strength of the corresponding triad interactions depends on the forcing
frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. In many cases, the further assumption of
Hamiltonian structure in the inviscid limit determines whether the given triad
interaction has an enhancing or suppressing effect on related patterns.
Surprisingly, even for forcing functions with arbitrarily many frequency
components, there are at most five frequencies that affect each of the
important triad interactions at leading order. The relative phases of those
forcing components play a key role, sometimes making the difference between an
enhancing and suppressing effect. In numerical examples, we examine the
validity of our results for larger values of the damping and forcing. Finally,
we apply our findings to one-dimensional periodic patterns obtained with
impulsive forcing and to two-dimensional superlattice patterns and
quasipatterns obtained with multi-frequency forcing.

generally, partly due to the complexity of the formalism and the new challenges
of their findings, which left philosophy proper at a loss, physicists have
attempted to developed their own meaning of their subject. For instance, in
recent years, the interpretation of quantum mechanics has stimulated a new type
of experimental philosophy, which seeks to operationalize emerging
philosophical issues; issues which are incomprehensible for most philosophers.
In this respect, physics often appears to be a continuation of philosophy by
other means. Yet, Feyerabend has also expressed profound insights into the
possibilities for the progress of physics, a legacy which remains to be
implemented in the times to come: the conquest of abundance, the richness of

Octamer repositiong through one-basepair twist defects and through ten-basepair

model of twist defects inducing a corkscrew motion of the nucleosome as the
underlying mechanism of nucleosome sliding. We provide a theoretical estimate
of the nucleosomal mobility without adjustable parameters, as a function of

abstract algebraic approach to a model of reversible quantum cellular automata
(CA) on a lattice. It was used special model of CA based on partitioning scheme
and so there is a question about quantum CA derived from more general, standard
model of classical CA. In present work is considered an approach to definition
of a scheme with ""history"", valid for quantization both irreversible and
reversible classical CA directly using local transition rules. It is used
language of vectors in Hilbert spaces instead of C*-algebras, but results may
be compared in some cases. Finally, the quantum lattice gases, quantum walk and
""bots"" are also discussed briefly.

electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a perfectly reflecting plane boundary.
The presence of the boundary modifies the quantum fluctuations of the electric
field, which in turn modifies the motion of the test particle. We calculate the
resulting mean squared fluctuations in the velocity and position of the test
particle. In the case of directions transverse to the boundary, the results are
negative. This can be interpreted as reducing the quantum uncertainty which
would otherwise be present.

  with higher resolution figures can be obtained from
  http://chaos.fiz.uni-lj.si/~znidaricm/research",,,,"quant-ph nlin.CD",,"  The stability of quantum systems to perturbations of the Hamiltonian is
studied. This stability is quantified by the fidelity. Dependence of fidelity
on the initial state as well as on the dynamical properties of the system is
considered. In particular, systems having a chaotic or regular classical limit
are analysed. The fidelity decay rate is given by an integral of the
correlation function of the perturbation and is thus smaller the faster
correlation function decays. If the perturbation can be written as a time
derivative of another operator, meaning that the time averaged perturbation
vanishes, fidelity freezes at a constant value and starts to decay only after a
long time inversely proportional to the perturbation strength. In composite
systems stability of entanglement to perturbations of the Hamiltonian is
analysed in terms of purity. For regular systems purity decay is shown to be
independent of Planck's constant for coherent initial states in the
semiclassical limit. The accelerated decoherence of macroscopic superpositions
is also explained. The theory of fidelity decay is applied to the stability of
quantum computation and an improved quantum Fourier transform algorithm is
designed.
