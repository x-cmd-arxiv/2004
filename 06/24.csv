unstable g-modes trapped in the iron (Fe) core by the convective burning layers

We perform a modal analysis of the last minutes before collapse of published
core structures and derive eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions, including the
nonadiabatic effects of growth by nuclear burning and decay by both neutrino
and acoustic losses. In general, we find two types of g-modes: inner-core
g-modes, which are stabilized by neutrino losses and outer-core g-modes which
are trapped near the burning shells and can be unstable. Without exception, we
find at least one unstable g-mode for each progenitor in the entire mass range
we consider, 11 M$_{\sun}$ to 40 M$_{\sun}$. More importantly, we find that the
timescales for growth and decay are an order of magnitude or more longer than
the time until the commencement of core collapse. We conclude that the
$\epsilon$-mechanism may not have enough time to significantly amplify core
g-modes prior to collapse.

associated with Galactic stars of which 27 are previously recognized cloud
members. These include three PMS brown dwarfs; the protostellar brown dwarf ISO
192 has a particularly high level of magnetic activity. Followup optical
photometry and spectroscopy establishes that 9-10 of the Chandra sources are
probably magnetically active background stars. Several previously proposed
cloud members are also inferred to be interlopers due to the absence of X-ray
emission at the level expected from the L_t - K correlation. No new X-ray
discovered stars were confidently found despite the high sensitivity.

initial mass function (IMF) derived from our sample is deficient in 0.1-0.3 Mo

component is on average larger than that of the dark matter (DM) component and
we find this effect to be more pronounced at lower redshifts. A significant
fraction f of gas has negative angular momentum and this fraction is found to
increase with redshift. We describe a toy model in which the tangential
velocities of particles are smeared by Gaussian random motions. This model is
successful in explaining some of the angular momentum properties. We compare
and contrast various techniques to determine the angular momentum distributions
(AMDs). We show that broadening of velocity dispersions is unsuitable for
making comparisons between gas and DM. We smooth the angular momentum of the
particles over a fixed number of neighbors. We find that an analytical function
based on gamma distribution can be used to describe a wide variety of profiles,
with just one parameter \alpha. The distribution of the shape parameter
$\alpha$ for both gas and DM follows roughly a log-normal distribution. The
mean and standard deviation of log(\alpha) for gas is -0.04 and 0.11
respectively. About 90-95% of halos have \alpha<1.3, while exponential disks in
NFW halos would require 1.3<\alpha<1.6. This implies that a typical halo in
simulations has an excess of low angular momentum material as compared to that
of observed exponential disks, a result which is consistent with the findings
of earlier works. \alpha for gas is correlated with that of DM but they have a
significant scatter <\alpha_Gas/\alpha_DM>=1.09 \pm 0.2. \alpha_Gas is also
biased towards slightly higher values compared to \alpha_DM.

to be relaxed. Emission is detected at >3 sigma significance to a radius of 88%
of R200 (the radius enclosing an overdensity of 200 times the critical density
at z=0.624) in a surface-brightness profile. A temperature profile (extending
to 0.7R200), and hardness-ratio map show no significant departures from the
global temperature, within the statistical limits of the data. The cluster's
bolometric X-ray luminosity is L=(4.3+/-0.3)*10^44 erg/s, and the total mass
derived within R200, assuming isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium, is
M_200=3.0^{+0.6}_{-0.5}*10^14 Msolar. The gas entropy measured at 0.1R200 is
compared with a sample of local systems, and found to be consistent with
self-similar evolution with redshift. The metallicity, gas density profile
slope, and gas mass fraction are all consistent with those found in low-z
clusters.

several molecules are presented and discussed. We predict enhanced column
densities for more than 30 species, especially radicals and ions. Comparison
between observations and models is improved with a moderate UV field incident
on the inner envelope, corresponding to an enhancement factor G0~10-100 at 200
AU from the star with an optical depth tau~15-17. Subtle differences are found
compared with traditional models of Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs) because of
the higher temperatures and higher gas-phase H2O abundance caused by
evaporation of ices in the inner region. In particular, the CN/HCN ratio is not
a sensitive tracer of the inner UV field, in contrast with the situation for
normal PDRs: for low UV fields, the extra CN reacts with H2 in the inner dense
and warm region and produces more HCN. It is found that the CH+ abundance is
strongly enhanced and grows steadily with increasing UV field. High-J lines of
molecules like CN and HCN are most sensitive to the inner dense region where UV
radiation plays a role. Thus, even though the total column density affected by
UV photons is small, comparison of high-J and low-J lines can selectively trace

collapsing hydrogen clouds. The spatial distribution of the brightness
temperature excess $\delta T_b$ is highly non-Gaussian. It consists of spikes
with high $\delta T_b$ and a low $\delta T_b$ area between the spikes. The
field has the following statistical features: (1) the one-point distributions
of $\delta T_b$ are described approximately by power-law tailed probability
distribution functions; (2) the nth-order moment of $\delta T_b$ is increasing
much faster with n than that of a Gaussian field, but slower than that of a
lognormal field; (3) the scale-scale correlation of the $\delta T_b$ field is
significant for all scales larger than the Jeans length of the gas. These

orbit there exist two different orbits at which the vertical and radial
epicyclic oscillations are in either a 3:1 or 3:2 parametric resonance for any
choice of the black hole angular momentum $a$. If the two orbits are required
to be frequency commensurable Keplerian orbits there is only one solution for
the two orbit radii and $a$. This model predicts that the microquasars have the
same $a$, and it predicts their black hole masses on the basis of the measured
HFQPOs in agreement with the dynamically determined masses. Application of this
model to the Galactic Center black hole Sgr A* using the recently measured QPOs

possibility that all four sources have $a$=0.99616 suggests that this value is
the upper limit of $a$ imposed by general relativity. The same value for the
lower orbit radius and the same value for $a$ are also suggested by an analysis
of the general relativistic expression for the radial gradient of the orbital
velocity, which changes sign in a narrow annular region around the lower orbit

range where supernova rates have been estimated from observations.
  The rate of core collapse supernovae can be used as an independent probe of
the cosmic star formation rate. Based on the observations of 17 core collapse
supernovae, we measure an increase in the core collapse supernova rate by a
factor of 1.6 in the range 0.3<z<0.7, and an overall increase by a factor of 7
to z~0.7 in comparison to the local core collapse supernova rate. The increase
in the rate in this redshift range in consistent with recent measurements of
the star formation rate derived from UV-luminosity densities and IR datasets.
  Based on 25 type Ia supernovae, we find a SN Ia rate that is a factor 3-5
higher at z~1 compared to earlier estimates at lower redshifts (z<0.5),
implying that the type Ia supernova rate traces a higher star formation rate at
redshifts z>1 compared to low redshift. At higher redshift (z>1), we find a
suggested decrease in the type Ia rate with redshift. This evolution of the Ia
rate with redshift is consistent with a type Ia progenitor model where there is
a substantial delay between the formation of the progenitor star and the
explosion of the supernova. Assuming that the type Ia progenitor stars have
initial main sequence masses 3-8 M_Sun, we find that 5-7% of the available
progenitors explode as type Ia supernovae.

stepwise manner, and their motion is powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. Recent
experiments have investigated the coupling between the individual steps of
single kinesin molecules and ATP hydrolysis, taking explicitly into account
forward steps, backward steps and detachments. A theoretical study of
mechanochemical coupling in kinesins, which extends the approach used
successfully to describe the dynamics of conventional motor proteins, is
presented. The possibility of irreversible detachments of kinesins from the
microtubules is also explicitly taken into account. Using the method of first-
passage times, experimental data on the mechanochemical coupling in kinesins
are fully described using the simplest two-state model. It is shown that the
dwell times for the kinesin to move one step forward or backward, or to
dissociate irreversibly are the same, although the probabilities of these
events are different. It is concluded that the current theoretical view, that
only the forward motion of the motor protein molecule is coupled to ATP
hydrolysis, is consistent with all available experimental observations for

where memory effects vanish there is a transition from a weakly localized
regime (where the walker returns to its starting point) to an escape regime.
Inside the escape regime there is a second critical value where the random walk
becomes superdiffusive. The probability distribution is shown to be governed by
a non-Markovian Fokker-Planck equation with hopping rates that depend both on
time and on the starting position of the walk. On large scales the memory
organizes itself into an effective harmonic oscillator potential for the random
walker with a time-dependent spring constant $k = (2p-1)/t$. The solution of
this problem is a Gaussian distribution with time-dependent mean and variance
which both depend on the initiation of the process.

deformed special relativity (DSR) theories. This point of view eventually helps
understanding some puzzling features of DSR. It also explains how DSR can be
considered as an effective flat (low energy) limit of a (true) quantum gravity
theory. This point of view leads us to consider a possible generalization of
DSR to arbitrary curvature in momentum space and to speculate about a possible
formulation of an effective quantum gravity model in these terms. It also leads
us to suggest a {\it doubly deformed special relativity} framework for
describing particle kinematics in an effective low energy description of

functions. We first study the limit of large angular momentum for the so-called
GKP-W relation in supergeravity approximation, connecting directly the
effective action in the bulk and the generating functional of correlation
functions on the boundary. The spacetime tunneling picture which has been
proposed in our previous works naturally emerges. This gives not only a
justification of our previous proposal, with some important refinements, on the
mapping between bulk effective interaction and the CFT coefficients on the
boundary in the plane-wave limit, but also implies various insights on the
interpretation of holography in the plane-wave limit. Based on this result, we
construct a new `holographic' string field theory. We confirm for several
nontrivial examples that this gives the CFT coefficients derived by
perturbation theory on the gauge-theory side.
  Our results are useful for understanding how apparently different duality
maps proposed from different standpoints are consistent with each other and
with our definite spacetime picture for the AdS holography in the plane-wave

  Crawley-Boevey and P.Shaw",,,,"math.QA math.AG",,"  Let D be a simply laced Dynkin diagram of rank r whose affinization has the
shape of a star (i.e., D4,E6,E7,E8). To such a diagram one can attach a group G
whose generators correspond to the legs of the affinization, have orders equal
to the leg lengths plus 1, and the product of the generators is 1. The group G
is then a 2-dimensional crystallographic group: G=Z_l\ltimes Z^2, where l is
2,3,4, and 6, respectively. In this paper, we define a flat deformation H(t,q)
of the group algebra C[G] of this group, by replacing the relations saying that
the generators have prescribed orders by their deformations, saying that the
generators satisfy monic polynomial equations of these orders with arbitrary
roots (which are deformation parameters). The algebra H(t,q) for D4 is the
Cherednik algebra of type C^\check C_1, which was studied by Noumi, Sahi, and
Stokman, and controls Askey-Wilson polynomials. We prove that H(t,q) is the
universal deformation of the twisted group algebra of G, and that this
deformation is compatible with certain filtrations on C[G]. We also show that
if q is a root of unity, then for generic t the algebra H(t,q) is an Azumaya
algebra, and its center is the function algebra on an affine del Pezzo surface.
For generic q, the spherical subalgebra eH(t,q)e provides a quantization of
such surfaces. We also discuss connections of H(t,q) with preprojective
algebras and Painlev\'e VI.

enriched diagrams defined on A, taking values in simplicial sets. The standard
model structure for presheaves of simplicial sets induces a coarse equivariant
structure for enriched contravariant A-diagrams. If the presheaf of categories
is a presheaf of groupoids G, then the associated homotopy theory is Quillen
equivalent to the homotopy theory of simplicial presheaves over BG, and so the
homotopy theory for the fibred site C/G is an invariant of the homotopy type of

presheaves of symmetric spectra on C/G. In particular, stack cohomology can be

reasonably well explains the present $^{11}$B($p, p'$) result. However, the
calculated cross section for the 8.92-MeV 3/2$^-_2$ state was significantly
smaller than the experimental values. The transition strengths obtained in the

estimated by using the isovector and isoscalar spin-flip M1 strengths. The

a novel structural evolution. The formation of the icosahedral (Ih) structure
is dominant despite its energetic metastability. This important phenomenon,
hitherto not understood, is studied by calculating free energies of gold
nanoclusters. The structural transition barriers have been determined by using
the umbrella sampling technique combined with molecular dynamics simulations.
Our calculations show that the formation of Ih gold nanoclusters is attributed
to the lower free energy barrier from the liquid to the Ih phases compared to
the barrier from the liquid to the face-centered-cubic crystal phases.
