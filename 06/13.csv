  D. Block et al., Kluwer",,"10.1007/978-1-4020-2862-5_4",,"astro-ph",,"  In the current galaxy formation scenarios, two physical phenomena are invoked
to build disk galaxies: hierarchical mergers and more quiescent external gas
accretion, coming from intergalactic filaments. Although both are thought to
play a role, their relative importance is not known precisely. Here we consider
the constraints on these scenarios brought by the observation-deduced star
formation history on the one hand, and observed dynamics of galaxies on the
other hand: the high frequency of bars and spirals, the high frequency of
perturbations such as lopsidedness, warps, or polar rings.
  All these observations are not easily reproduced in simulations without
important gas accretion. N-body simulations taking into account the mass
exchange between stars and gas through star formation and feedback, can
reproduce the data, only if galaxies double their mass in about 10 Gyr through
gas accretion. Warped and polar ring systems are good tracers of this
accretion, which occurs from cold gas which has not been virialised in the
system's potential. The relative importance of these phenomena are compared
between the field and rich clusters. The respective role of mergers and gas
accretion vary considerably with environment.

fluid-filled cylinder at nanometer scales. The particle, the cylinder wall and
the fluid solvent are all treated as atomic systems, and special attention is
given to the effects of varying the wetting properties of the fluid. Although
the modification of the solid-fluid interaction leads to significant changes in
the microstructure of the fluid, its transport properties are found to be the
same as in bulk. Independently of the shape and relative size of the particle,
we find two distinct regimes as a function of the degree of wetting, with a
sharp transition between them. In the case of a highly-wetting suspending
fluid, the particle moves through the cylinder with an average axial velocity
in agreement with that obtained from the solution of the continuum Stokes
equations. In contrast, in the case of less-wetting fluids, only the early-time
motion of the particle is consistent with continuum dynamics. At later times,
the particle is eventually adsorbed onto the wall and subsequently executes an
intermittent stick-slip motion.We show that van der Walls forces are the
dominant contribution to the particle adsorption phenomenon and that depletion
forces are weak enough to allow, in the highly-wetting situation, an initially
adsorbed particle to spontaneously desorb.

connected to two superconducting (SC) leads with the gaps
$\Delta_{\alpha}=|\Delta_{\alpha}| e^{i \theta_{\alpha}}$, where $\alpha = L,
R$ for the lead at left and right. We show that, when one of the SC gaps is
much larger than the others $|\Delta_L| \gg |\Delta_R|$, the starting model can
be mapped exactly onto the single-channel model, which consists of the right
lead of $\Delta_R$ and the Anderson impurity with an extra onsite SC gap of
$\Delta_d \equiv \Gamma_L e^{i \theta_L}$. Here $\theta_L$ and $\Gamma_L$ are
defined with respect to the starting model, and $\Gamma_L$ is the level width
due to the coupling with the left lead. Based on this simplified model, we
study the ground-state properties for the asymmetric gap, $|\Delta_L| \gg
|\Delta_R|$, using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The
results show that the phase difference of the SC gaps $\phi \equiv \theta_R
-\theta_L$, which induces the Josephson current, disturbs the screening of the
local moment to destabilize the singlet ground state typical of the Kondo
system. It can also drive the quantum phase transition to a magnetic doublet
ground state, and at the critical point the Josephson current shows a
discontinuous change. The asymmetry of the two SC gaps causes a re-entrant
magnetic phase, in which the in-gap bound state lies close to the Fermi level.

$\hbar\omega_{res}$ play a primary role in determining $T_{c}$ in the
underdoped region. We propose a picture that roton-like excitations in the
cuprates appear as a coupled mode, which has the resonance mode for spin and
charge responses at different momentum transfers but the same energy transfers,
as detected respectively, by the neutron S=1 mode and the Raman S=0 A1$_{g}$
mode. We shall call this as the ``hybrid spin/charge roton''. After discussing
the role of dimensionality in condensation, we propose a generic phase diagram
of the cuprates with spatial phase separation in the overdoped region as a
special case of the BE-BCS crossover conjecture where the superconducting
coupling is lost rapidly in the overdoped region. Using a microscopic model of
charge motion resonating with antiferomagnetic spin fluctuations, we propose a
possibility that the hybrid spin/charge roton and higher-energy spin
fluctuations mediate the superconducting pairing. In this model, the resonance
modes can be viewed as a meson-analogue and the ``dome'' shape of the phase
diagram can be understood as a natural consequence of departure from the

functions and thermodynamic properties (magnetization, isothermal magnetic
susceptibility, specific heat) are calculated self-consistently at arbitrary
temperatures and fields. In addition, exact diagonalizations on finite lattices
and, in the one-dimensional case, exact calculations by the Bethe-ansatz method
for the quantum transfer matrix are performed. A good agreement of the
Green's-function theory with the exact data, with recent quantum Monte Carlo
results, and with the spin polarization of a $\nu=1$ quantum Hall ferromagnet
is obtained. The field dependences of the position and height of the maximum in
the temperature dependence of the susceptibility are found to fit well to power
laws, which are critically analyzed in relation to the recently discussed
behavior in Landau's theory. As revealed by the spin correlation functions and
the specific heat at low fields, our theory provides an improved description of
magnetic short-range order as compared with the random phase approximation. In
one dimension and at very low fields, two maxima in the temperature dependence
of the specific heat are found. The Bethe-ansatz data for the field dependences
of the position and height of the low-temperature maximum are described by
power laws. At higher fields in one and two dimensions, the temperature of the
specific heat maximum linearly increases with the field.

of the cuprate superconductors. In the normal state, small angle scattering
from out-of-plane impurities is thought to broaden the ARPES spectral response
with minimal effect on the resistivity or the superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$. Here we explore how such forward scattering affects the
ARPES spectrum in the d-wave superconducting state. Away from the nodal
direction, the one-electron impurity scattering rate is found to be suppressed
as $\omega$ approaches the gap edge by a cancellation between normal and
anomalous scattering processes, leading to a square-root-like feature in the
spectral weight as $\omega$ approaches $-\Delta_\k$ from below. For momenta
away from the Fermi surface, our analysis suggests that a dirty optimally or
overdoped system will still display a sharp but nondispersive peak which could
be confused with a quasiparticle spectral feature. Only in cleaner samples
should the true dispersing quasiparticle peak become visible. At the nodal
point on the Fermi surface, the contribution of the anomalous scattering
vanishes and the spectral weight exhibits a Lorentzian quasiparticle peak in
both energy and momentum.
  Our analysis, including a treatment of unitary scatterers and inelastic spin
fluctuation scattering, suggests explanations for the sometimes mysterious
lineshapes and temperature dependences of the peak structures observed in the
\BSCCO system.

the structure of the packing implies that the minimum distance d(n) between
disk centers is the root of polynomial P_n with integer coefficients. In most

theoretically because contributions related to non-trivial color structures
have not been studied completely. Other multiquark states, especially
dibaryons, have been discussed also. A strangeness -3 N$\Omega$ dibaryon has
been shown to have a width as small as 12-22 keV and should be detectable in
$\Omega$ high productivity reactions such as at RHIC, COMPAS and the planned
JHF and FAIR projects.

allows us to describe the dynamics in terms of operator algebra, rather than in

Ideal-gas REference (DFIRE) state is applied to unbound protein-protein docking
structure selections. The performance of the DFIRE energy function is compared
to those of the well-established ZDOCK energy scores and RosettaDock energy
function using the comprehensive decoy sets generated by ZDOCK and RosettaDock.
Despite significant difference in the functional forms and complexities of the
three energy scores, the differences in overall performance for docking
structure selections are small between DFIRE and ZDOCK2.3 and between DFIRE and
RosettaDock. This result is remarkable considering that a single-term DFIRE
energy function was originally designed for monomer proteins while
multiple-term energy functions of ZDOCK and RosettaDock were specifically
optimized for docking. This provides hope that the accuracy of the existing
energy functions for docking can be improved.

"quant-ph/0406084","Mark P. Davidson","Mark P. Davidson","Bremsstrahlung from Charged Bose-Einstein Condensates","15 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Low energy bremsstrahlung formulae are derived for a particle beam of charged
bosons forming a Bose-Einsten condensate. The expression for energy radiated
consists of two terms in this case. One of them, the larger one in the limit of
large numbers of Bosons in the state, is proportional to the number of bosons
squared and has the same form as one obtains in a hydrodynamic model of quantum
wave mechanics. This term is sensitive to the size and shape of the wave packet
especially when the force field causing acceleration is localized in extent.
The second term, identical to the single particle scattering formula, is less
sensitive to the wave packet size and shape and is proportional to the number
of bosons in the condensate. The conclusion is that for a Bose-Einstein
condensate the radiated bremsstrahlung is a sensitive function of the wave
packet shape which is quite different than for a beam of incoherent particles
which do not show very much dependence on the wave packet. Only lowest order
radiation is calculated. It is also found that to lowest order there does not
exist any situation in which the radiation loss from a coherent state of bosons
vanishes completely, so that there is no analog of superconductivity in a
particle beam of this type at least within the net of assumptions made in this
paper. The amount of radiation can be greatly suppressed however, as it is a
sensitive function of the form of the wave function.
