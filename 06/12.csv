multidimensional (2D and 3D) hydrodynamical simulations of the thermonuclear
burning phase in SNIa. The detailed nucleosynthetic yields of our explosion
models are calculated by post-processing the ejecta, using passively advected
tracer particles. The nuclear reaction network employed in computing the
explosive nucleosynthesis contains 383 nuclear species. We analyzed two
different choices of ignition conditions (centrally ignited, in which the
spherical initial flame geometry is perturbated with toroidal rings, and
bubbles, in which multi-point ignition conditions are simulated). We show that
unburned C and O varies typically from ~40% to ~50% of the total ejected
material.The main differences between all our models and standard 1D
computations are, besides the higher mass fraction of unburned C and O, the C/O
ratio (in our case is typically a factor of 2.5 higher than in 1D
computations), and somewhat lower abundances of certain intermediate mass
nuclei such as S, Cl, Ar, K, and Ca, and of 56Ni. Because explosive C and O
burning may produce the iron-group elements and their isotopes in rather
different proportions one can get different 56Ni-fractions (and thus supernova
luminosities) without changing the kinetic energy of the explosion. Finally, we
show that we need the high resolution multi-point ignition (bubbles) model to
burn most of the material in the center (demonstrating that high resolution
coupled with a large number of ignition spots is crucial to get rid of unburned
material in a pure deflagration SNIa model).

explanation for the red ``tail'' of the color distribution of SDSS quasars. Our
fitting to 5-band photometry normalized by the modal quasar color as a function
of redshift shows that this ``tail'' is well described by SMC-like reddening
but not by LMC-like, Galactic, or Gaskell et al. (2004) reddening. Extension to
longer wavelengths using a subset of 1886 SDSS-2MASS matches confirms these
results at high significance. We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations that match
the observed distribution of quasar spectral energy distributions using a
Lorentzian dust reddening distribution; 2% of quasars selected by the main SDSS
targeting algorithm (i.e., which are not extincted out of the sample) have
E_{B-V} > 0.1; less than 1% have E_{B-V} > 0.2, where the extinction is
relative to quasars with modal colors. Reddening is uncorrelated with the
presence of intervening narrow-line absorption systems, but reddened quasars
are much more likely to show narrow absorption at the redshift of the quasar
than are unreddened quasars. Thus the reddening towards quasars is dominated by
SMC-like dust at the quasar redshift.

supernova remnant (SNR) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. To study the physical
conditions of this SNR, we have obtained XMM-Newton X-ray observations, optical
images and high-dispersion spectra, and radio continuum maps. Optical images of
SNR 0450-70.9 show a large, irregular elliptical shell with bright filaments
along the eastern and western rims and within the shell interior. The interior
filaments have higher [S II]/Halpha ratios and form an apparent inner shell
morphology. The X-ray emission region is smaller than the full extent of the
optical shell, with the brightest X-ray emission found within the small
interior shell and on the western rim of the large shell. The expansion
velocity of the small shell is ~220 km/s, while the large shell is ~120 km/s.
  The radio image shows central brightening and a fairly flat radio spectral
index over the SNR. However, no point X-ray or radio source corresponding to a
pulsar is detected and the X-ray emission is predominantly thermal. Therefore,
these phenomena can be most reasonably explained in terms of the advanced age
of the large SNR. Using hydrodynamic models combined with a nonequilibrium
ionization model for thermal X-ray emission, we derived a lower limit on the
SNR age of about 45,000 yr, well into the later stages of SNR evolution.
Despite this, the temperature and density derived from spectral fits to the
X-ray emission indicate that the remnant is still overpressured, and thus that
the development is largely driven by hot gas in the SNR interior.

emission comprises hot gas, with an ~isothermal temperature profile (~0.5 keV),
and emission from unresolved point-sources. In contrast with the cool cores of
many groups and clusters, we find a small central temperature peak. We obtain
emission-weighted abundance contraints within 20 kpc for several key elements:
Fe, O, Ne, Mg and Si. The measured iron abundance (Z_Fe=1.1 in solar units;
>0.53 at 99% confidence) strongly excludes the very sub-solar values often
historically reported for early-type galaxies but agrees with recent
observations of brighter galaxies and groups. The abundance ratios, with
respect to Fe, of the other elements were also found to be ~solar, although
Z_o/Z_Fe was significantly lower (<0.4). Such a low O abundance is not
predicted by simple models of ISM enrichment by Type Ia and Type II supernovae,
and may indicate a significant contribution from primordial hypernovae.
Revisiting Chandra observations of the moderate-Lx, isolated elliptical NGC
720, we obtain similar abundance constraints. Adopting standard SNIa and SNII
metal yields, our abundance ratio constraints imply 73+/-5% and 85+/-6% of the
Fe enrichment in NGC 1332 and NGC 720, respectively, arises from SNIa. Although
these results are sensitive to the considerable systematic uncertainty in the
SNe yields, they are in good agreement with observations of more massive
systems. These two moderate-Lx early-type galaxies reveal a consistent pattern
of metal enrichment from cluster scales to moderate Lx/Lb galaxies. (abridged)

inspiral and merger of a massive black hole binary. This study is motivated by
the very massive nuclear gas disks observed in the central regions of merging
galaxies. Here we present results that expand on the treatment in a previous
work (Escala, Larson, Coppi & Mardones 2004; henceforth Paper I), by studying
more realistic models. We run a variety of models, ranging from simulations
with a relatively smooth gas disk to cases in which the gas has a more clumpy
spatial distribution. We also vary the inclination angle between the plane of
the binary and the plane of the disk, and the mass ratio between the MBHs and
the gaseous disk. We find that as in Paper I, in the early evolution of the
system the binary separation diminishes due to gravitational drag, and in the
later stages the medium responds by forming an ellipsoidal density enhancement
whose axis lags behind the binary axis; this offset produces a torque on the
binary that causes continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce
the separation to distances where gravitational radiation is efficient. In the
simulations that we perform, we find that the coalescence timescale for the MBH
binary varies between 5 10^6 yr and 2.5 10^7 yr. For MBHs that satisfy the
observed `m-sigma_c' relation, we predict that in a merger of galaxies that
have at least 1% of their total mass in gas, the MBHs will coalesce soon after
the galaxies merge. We also predict that if the MBHs depart from the
`m-sigma_c' relation, the MBH binary can create a circumbinary gap in the disk
that stalls the coalescence, but this gap formation can act as a
self-regulatory mechanism on MBH growth that can help to explain the existence
of the `m-sigma_c' relation.

subgalactic halos are overproduced than the observed dwarf galaxies in the
Local Group. In this paper, as a potential mechanism to solve this problem, we
consider the feedback effects of the early reionization on the formation of
small-scale structures. For this purpose, we perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic
simulations with incorporating the radiative transfer for ionizing photons. As
a result, it is found that the early reionization is so devastating for
low-mass systems with M_{vir}\la 10^8 M_\odot or v_{circ}\la 20km/s, and almost
all gas is photo-evaporated in more than 95% of low-mass systems. Such a strong
negative feedback on the formation of low-mass galaxies may solve the

are descendants of the more massive halos that experienced and survived tidal

atomic-sized contacts exhibit a peak structure, which is characteristic of the

problem. In order to shed some light on this issue, we present a theoretical
analysis of the conductance histograms of Au atomic contacts. We have combined
classical molecular dynamics simulations of the breaking of nanocontacts with
conductance calculations based on a tight-binding model. This combination gives
us access to crucial information such as contact geometries, forces, minimum
cross-section, total conductance and transmission coefficients of the
individual conduction channels. The ensemble of our results suggests that the
low temperature Au conductance histograms are a consequence of a subtle
interplay between mechanical and electrical properties of these nanocontacts.
At variance with other suggestions in the literature, our results indicate that
the peaks in the Au conductance histograms are not a simple consequence of
conductance quantization or the existence of exceptionally stable radii. We
show that the main peak in the histogram close to one quantum of conductance is
due to the formation of single-atom contacts and chains of gold atoms.
Moreover, we present a detailed comparison with experimental results on Au
atomic contacts where the individual channel transmissions have been
determined.

drive the thermal inflation, and make two crucial assumptions: the flaton
vacuum expectation value generates the $\mu$-term of the MSSM and $m_L^2 +

violates a well known constraint, implying that there exists a nearby deep
non-MSSM vacuum, and provides a clear signature of our model which can be
tested at future particle accelerators. We show that our model leads to thermal
inflation followed by Affleck-Dine leptogenensis along the $LH_u$ flat
direction. A key feature of our leptogenesis scenario is that the $H_uH_d$ flat
direction is also induced to temporarily acquire a large value, playing a
crucial role in the leptogenesis, as well as dynamically shielding the field

quark mass M_s is unimportant, all nine quarks (three colors; three flavors)
pair in a color-flavor locked (CFL) pattern, and all fermionic quasiparticles
have a gap. We recently argued that the next phase down in density (as a
function of decreasing quark chemical potential mu or increasing strange quark
mass M_s) is the new ``gapless CFL'' (``gCFL'') phase in which only seven
quasiparticles have a gap, while there are gapless quasiparticles described by
two dispersion relations at three momenta. There is a continuous quantum phase
transition from CFL to gCFL quark matter at M_s^2/mu approximately equal to
2*Delta, with Delta the gap parameter. Gapless CFL, like CFL, leaves unbroken a
linear combination ""Q-tilde"" of electric and color charges, but it is a
Q-tilde-conductor with gapless Q-tilde-charged quasiparticles and a nonzero
electron density. In this paper, we evaluate the gapless CFL phase, in several
senses. We present the details underlying our earlier work which showed how
this phase arises. We display all nine quasiparticle dispersion relations in
full detail. Using a general pairing ansatz that only neglects effects that are
known to be small, we perform a comparison of the free energies of the gCFL,
CFL, 2SC, gapless 2SC, and 2SCus phases. We conclude that as density drops,
making the CFL phase less favored, the gCFL phase is the next spatially uniform
quark matter phase to occur. A mixed phase made of colored components would
have lower free energy if color were a global symmetry, but in QCD such a mixed
phase is penalized severely.

magnitude of wave packet sizes of particles in the initial state and final

Within general relativity, the resonant \emph{quasinormal} (QN) modes dominate
in the response of a black hole to external perturbations. At the same time,
the metric of an evaporating black hole is affected by the Hawking radiation.
We estimate the shift in the quasinormal spectrum of the BTZ black hole
stipulated by the back reaction of the Hawking radiation. For the case of the
2+1 dimensional black hole the corrected (by $\sim \hbar$) metric is an
\emph{exact} solution [C.Martines, J.Zanelli (1997)]. In addition, in this case
quantum corrections come only from matter fields and no from graviton loops,
that is, one can solve the problem of influence of the back reaction upon the
QN ringing self-consistently. The dominant contribution to the corrections to
the QNMs is simply a shift of $\omega^{2}$ proportional to
$-(\frac{\Lambda}{M})^{3/2} (4 L^{2} +M) \hbar$. It is negligible for large
black holes but essential for small ones, giving rise to considerable
increasing of the quality factor. Thus, the small evaporating black hole is
expected to be much better oscillator than a large one.

twists and from asymmetric orbifolds. Strings in ` T-fold' backgrounds with a
local $n$-torus fibration and T-duality transition functions in $O(n,n;\Z)$ are

For a geometric background, the local choices of $T^n$ fit together to give a
spacetime which is a $T^n$ bundle, while for non-geometric string backgrounds
they do not fit together to form a manifold. In such cases spacetime geometry
only makes sense locally, and the global structure involves the doubled

Finally, bistability is lost and the system settles down in a steady state, or,

precisions are required at the neutron richness of A/Z = 3.0 at the N=82 shell
closure and A/Z = 2.9 at the N=50 shell closure. For the doubly magic nuclide
78Ni, a precision of 1sigma ~< 300 keV and 1sigma ~< 5 ms are required,
respectively, for mass and half-life measurements. This analysis aims to
provide a first rough guide for ongoing detector developments.

tunneling effects the energy eigenvalue of the ground state is approximately
equal to the ground state energy for a harmonic oscillator localized at the
