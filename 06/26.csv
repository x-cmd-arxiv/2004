identified from the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey with the halo based
group finder recently developed by Yang et al (2004b). With this group
catalogue we are able to estimate the 2PCFs for systems ranging from isolated
galaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. The real-space correlation length
obtained for these systems ranges from $\sim 4\mpch$ to $\sim 15\mpch$,
respectively. The observed correlation amplitude (and the corresponding bias
factor) as a function of group abundance is well reproduced by associating
galaxy groups with dark matter haloes in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.
Redshift distortions are clearly detected in the redshift-space correlation
function, the degree of which is consistent with the assumption of
gravitational clustering and halo bias in the cosmic density field. In
agreement with previous studies we find a strong increase of the correlation
length with the mean inter-group separation. Although well determined
observationally, we show that current theoretical predictions are not yet
accurate enough to allow for stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.
Finally, we use our results to explore the power-law nature of the 2PCF of
galaxies. We split the 2PCF in 1-group and 2-group terms, equivalent to the
1-halo and 2-halo terms in halo occupation models, and show that the power-law
form of the 2PCF is broken, when only including galaxies in the more massive

it is nearly constant in low mass halos. We use a new weak lensing analysis

  Networks as a Function of the Bias","11 pages, 18 figures","Fluctuation and Noise Letters, vol. 2, R29-R49, 2002",,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  A short review is presented of a recently developed computational approach
which allows the study of the resistance noise over the full range of bias
values, from the linear regime up to electrical breakdown. Resistance noise is
described in terms of two competing processes in a random resistor network. The
two processes are thermally activated and driven by an electrical bias. In the
linear regime, a scaling relation has been found between the relative variance
of resistance fluctuations and the average resistance. The value of the
critical exponent is significantly higher than that associated with 1/f noise.
In the nonlinear regime, occurring when the bias overcomes the threshold value,
the relative variance of resistance fluctuations scales with the bias. Two
regions can be identified in this regime: a moderate bias region and a
pre-breakdown one. In the first region, the scaling exponent has been found
independent of the values of the model parameters and of the bias conditions. A
strong nonlinearity emerges in the pre-breakdown region which is also
characterized by non-Gaussian noise. The results compare well with measurements
of electrical breakdown in composites and with electromigration experiments in
metallic lines.

  Fields to Strings: Circumnavigating Theoretical Physics''",,"10.1142/9789812775344_0016",,"hep-th",,"  Quantum fluctuations generate in three-dimensional gauge theories not only
radiative corrections to the Chern-Simons coupling but also non-analytic terms
in the effective action. We review the role of those terms in gauge theories
with massless fermions and Chern-Simons theories. The explicit form of
non-analytic terms turns out to be dependent on the regularization scheme and
in consequence the very existence of phenomena like parity and framing
anomalies becomes regularization dependent. In particular we find
regularization regimes where both anomalies are absent. Due to the presence of
non-analytic terms the effective action becomes not only discontinuous but also
singular for some background gauge fields which include sphalerons. The
appearence of this type of singularities is linked to the existence of nodal
configurations in physical states and tunneling suppression at some classical
field configurations. In the topological field theory the number of physical
states may also become regularization dependent. Another consequence of the
peculiar behaviour of three-dimensional theories under parity odd
regularizations is the existence of a simple mechanism of generation of a mass
gap in pure Yang-Mills theory by a suitable choice of regularization scheme.
The generic value of this mass does agree with the values obtained in
Hamiltonian and numerical analysis. Finally, the existence of different
regularization regimes unveils the difficulties of establishing a Zamolodchikov
c-theorem for three-dimensional field theories in terms of the induced
gravitational Chern-Simons couplings.

that basis choices at two ends are independent of each other may no longer be
true, and may pose a threat to the validity of Bell-type proofs.

A19 (2004) 2103-2112","10.1142/S0217732304015488",,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  We show that for the triple well potential with non-equivalent vacua,
instantons generate for the low lying energy states a singlet and a doublet of
states rather than a triplet of equal energy spacing. Our energy splitting
formulae are also confirmed numerically. This splitting property is due to the
presence of non-equivalent vacua. A comment on its generality to multi-well is
presented.

particles within the framework of the Dirac theory. It is shown that an
operator corresponds to the rate of the proper time and that the operator
contains terms which oscillate with a very high frequency. We deduce, as an
effect of these terms, the existence of an interference between the magnetic
field and the rate of proper time. There is a possibility that the conclusion
derived in this letter has some implications for astrophysics.
