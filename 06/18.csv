propagation of strongly magnetized hypersonic, but sub-Alfv\'enic ($C^{2}_{\rm
s} \ll V^{2}_{\rm jet} < V^{2}_{\rm A}$) flow and on the subsequent development
of a current-driven (CD) kink instability. This instability may be responsible
for the ``wiggled'' structures seen in sub-parsec scale (VLBI) jets. In the
present paper, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of PFD jets in a variety
of external ambient magnetized gas distributions, including those with density,
pressure, and temperature gradients. Our numerical results show that the jets
can develop CD distortions in the trans-Alfv\'enic flow case, even when the
flow itself is still strongly magnetically dominated. An internal
non-axisymmetric body mode grows on time scales of order of the Alfv\'en
crossing time and distorts the structure and magnetic configuration of the jet.
The kink ($m=1$) mode of the CD instability, driven by the radial component of
the Lorentz force, grows faster than other higher order modes ($m>1$). In the
jet frame the mode grows locally and expands radially at each axial position
where the jet is unstable: the instability, therefore, does not propagate as a
wave along the jet length. A naturally-occurring, external helically magnetized
wind, which is (quasi-) axially current-free, surrounds the well-collimated
current-carrying jet and reduces velocity shear between the jet and external
medium. This stabilizes the growth of MHD Kelvin-Helmholtz surface modes in the
inner jet flow.

at the base of the prominent jet that powers HH202 and is likely to be the
sought-after driver of this outflow. The second brightest infrared source is
located at the base of the HH529 jet. We consider the possibility that
HH203/204 and HH269 trace parts of a single bent outflow from the

alternating patterns of bright spots and shadows on opposite sides of the star

some binary models. The simplest interpretation of these UV images, where
excess UV escapes from the secondary star in the direction away from the

our line of sight, sharing the same equatorial plane as the Homunculus, and
with apastron for the hot secondary star oriented toward the southwest of the

Accepted by the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/423439",,"astro-ph",,"  Nearby associations are excellent objects for the study of the initial spin
up phase during the PMS evolution. An empirical approach is adopted here to
infer their rotations properties and relations to X-ray emission. Three nearby
associations are considered. The TW Hya association with an age of 8 Myr, the
Beta Pictoris moving group with 12 Myr and a combination of Tucana and
Horologium associations (30 Myr). Two low and high rotation modes are
considered for each association with stellar masses less than 1.5M and greater
than 1.5M respectively. We infer representative equatorial rotation velocities
Vo from the observed distribution of projected rotational velocities vsini. A
spin up is found for the high rotation mode, whereas in the low rotation mode
the Vo do not increase significantly. This insufficient increase of Vo is
probably the cause of a decrease of the total mean specific angular momentum
for the low mass stars between 8 and 30 Myr. However, for the high mass stars,
where a sufficient spin up is present, the specific angular momentum is
practically conserved in this same time interval. By supposing that the
distribution of masses of these three associations follows a universal mass
function, we estimate the number of members of these associations that remain
to be detected. The analysis of rotation and stellar masses using luminosity
X-rays indicators present similar properties, as the dependence on stellar mass
and rotation, at least for the younger associations, to those obtained for T
Tauri stars in the ONC. A strong desaturation effect appears at 30 Myr. This
effect seems to be provoked by the minimum configuration of the stellar
convection layers, attained for the first time for the higher mass stars at 30
Myr. The desaturation appears to be independent of rotation at this stage.

rate for 135 AGNs with double-peaked broad emission lines in two samples. With
black hole masses from $3\times 10^7M_\odot$ to $5\times 10^9M_\odot$, these
AGNs have the dimensionless accretion rates (Eddington ratios) between 0.001
and 0.1, and the bolometric luminosity between $10^{43}erg/s$ and
$10^{46}erg/s$, both being significantly larger than those of several
previously known low-luminosity double-peaked AGNs. The optical-X-ray spectra
indices, $\alpha_{OX}$, of these high-luminosity double-peaked AGNs is between
1 and 1.9. Modest correlations of the $\alpha_{OX}$ value with the Eddington
ratio and bolometric luminosity indicate that double-peaked AGNs with higher
Eddington ratio or higher luminosity tend to have larger $\alpha_{OX}$ value.
Therefore we suggested that the accretion process in some high-luminosity
double-peaked AGNs is probably different from that of low-luminosity objects
where an ADAF-like accretion flow was thought to exist. This is also supported
by the presence of possible big blue bumps in the spectra of some double-peaked
AGNs with higher Eddington ratios. We noticed that the prototype double-peaked
emission line AGN, Arp 102B, may be an ``intermediate'' object between the high
and low luminosity double-peaked AGNs. In addition, we found an apparent strong
anti-correlation between the peak separation of double-peaked profile and
Eddington ratio. If it is real, it may provide us a clue to understand why
double-peaked broad emission lines were hardly found in luminous AGNs with
Eddington ratio larger than 0.1.

in bulge or halo of gravitational macrolenses) or could be distributed in a
uniform way. We have analyzed both cases of such distributions. As a result of
our analysis, we obtained that the optical depth for microlensing caused by
stellar mass objects is usually small for quasar bulge and quasar halo
gravitational microlens distributions. On the other hand, the optical depth for

the thermally driven meridional circulation and of the turbulence generated by
the shear of differential rotation. The turbulence is assumed to be
anisotropic, due to the stratification, with stronger transport in the
horizontal directions than in the vertical. The main difference with the former
treatments by Zahn (1992) and Maeder & Zahn (1998) is that we expand here the
departures from spherical symmetry to higher order, and include explicitly the
differential rotation in latitude, to first order. This allows us to treat
simultaneously the bulk of a radiation zone and its tachocline(s). Moreover, we
take fully into account the non-stationarity of the problem, which will enable
us to tackle the rapid phases of evolution. The system of partial differential
equations, which govern the transport of angular momentum, heat and chemical
elements, is written in a form which makes it ready to implement in a stellar

bright, compact radio sources embedded in diffuse emission, with diameters less

sources, designated Source A and Source D, also have been detected and imaged
at milliarcsecond scales. Source A, which is associated with the nucleus of one
of the merging galaxies, contains five milliarcsecond-scale sources, each with
a radio power between 100 and 1000 times that of the Galactic supernova remnant
Cassiopeia A. Four of these have flat or inverted spectra and appear to be
young supernovae. Three of the VLBI-scale sources are located within 10 pc
(projected) of one another, and two are separated by less than 3 pc, indicating
that they all may be within the same super starcluster or complex of such
clusters. The brightest VLBI-scale source, A0, has an extremely inverted
pectrum, with alpha larger than +2 at gigahertz frequencies. It seems to be the
youngest supernova, which has not yet broken out of its circumstellar shell.
The milliarcsecond radio sources within Source A appear to constitute a
upernova factory, confirming the presence of an extreme starburst that peaked
at least a few million years ago.

structure and also illustrate typical features of more general cases. For these
models, we recast Einstein's field equations into a regular system on a compact
state space, which is the basis for our analysis. We prove that models expand
from a singularity and recollapse to a singularity when the perfect fluid
satisfies the strong energy condition. When the matter source admits Einstein's
static model, we present a comprehensive dynamical description, which includes
asymptotic behavior, of models in the neighborhood of the Einstein model; these
results make earlier claims about ``homoclinic phenomena and chaos'' highly
questionable. We also discuss aspects of the global asymptotic dynamics, in
particular, we give criteria for the collapse to a singularity, and we describe
when models expand forever to a state of infinite dilution; possible initial
and final states are analyzed. Numerical investigations complement the

values of $\Delta_{\rm atm}$, we find that the lowest mass, $m_1$, varies from
$1.4 - 3.6 10^{-3} eV$, the next lowest mass, $m_2$ varies only slightly from
$8.4 - 9.0 10^{-3} eV$, and the heaviest mass, $m_3$, ranges from $5.0 - 5.4
10^{-2} eV$. The elements of the mixing matrix, $U$, and of the mass matrix,
$M$, are examined with particular emphasis on the role of small angle
$\theta_{13}$. The phase, $\delta$, of the mixing matrix $U$ has a serious
effect in the mass matrix only for the matrix elements $M_{e\mu}$ and
$M_{e\tau}$, because these are the only ones for which the real part vanishes
in the allowed range for $\theta_{13}$. Their dependence on $s_{13}$ for
various values of $\delta$ is given explicitly. We study the elements of the
mass matrix, $M$, for our solution 1, that of the perfect rational hierarchy,
for the case $\delta = 0$, and find that all of them are smaller than $0.03
eV$. The only candidates for double texture zero models are $M_{ee}$ and
$M_{e\mu} = M_{\mu e}$.

Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson described a small Cartan model for the equivariant
cohomology of M, quasi-isomorphic to the standard Cartan complex of equivariant
differential forms. In this paper, we construct an explicit cochain map from
the small Cartan model into the standard Cartan model, inducing an isomorphism
in cohomology. The construction involves the solution of a remarkable
inhomogeneous Maurer-Cartan equation. This solution has further applications to
the theory of transgression in the Weil algebra, and to the Chevalley-Koszul
theory of the cohomology of principal bundles.

Modified Fraunhofer regime. The autocorrelation function at short times can be
expressed as a Gaussian with a direction dependent time scale. The directional
modulation is a function of the angle between the scattering direction and the
wave direction. The obtained relation can be used for directional sea state
estimation using one or more GNSS-R coastal receivers.

been hindered by an imperfect understanding of the relationship between input
RNA concentrations and output signals. We argue that this relationship can be
understood based on the underlying statistical mechanics of these devices. We
present a model that includes the relevant interactions between the molecules.
Our model for the first time accounts for partially zippered probe-target
hybrids in a physically realistic manner, and also includes target-target
binding in solution. Large segments of the target molecules are not bound to
the probes, often in an asymmetric pattern, emphasizing the importance of
modeling zippering properly. The resultant fit between the model and training
data using optimized parameters is excellent, and it also does well at
predicting test data.

coupled single-mode Bose-Einstein condensates. Both models have a fixed number
of degrees of freedom, which is small compared to the number of interaction
parameters, and is independent of the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. We
find that the distribution follows a universal Poisson form independent of the
choice of coupling parameters, which is indicative of the integrability of both
models. These results complement those for integrable lattice models where the
number of degrees of freedom increases with increasing dimensionality of the
Hilbert space. Finally, we also show that for one model the inclusion of an
additional interaction which breaks the integrability leads to a non-Poisson
distribution.

all four of his space-time coordinates. The user must carry a corner cube
reflector, a good clock, and have a two-way classical channel of communication
with the origin of the reference frame. Four pairs of entangled photons
(biphotons) are sent through four interferometers: three interferometers are
used to determine the user's spatial position, and an additional interferometer
is used to synchronize the user's clock to coordinate time in the reference
frame. The spatial positioning part of the QPS is similar to a classical
time-of-arrival (TOA) system, however, a classical TOA system (such as GPS)
must have synchronized clocks that keep coordinate time and therefore the
clocks must have long-term stability, whereas in the QPS only a photon
coincidence counter is needed and the clocks need only have short-term
stability. Several scenarios are considered for a QPS: one is a terrestrial
system and another is a space-based-system composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO)
satellites. Calculations indicate that for a space-based system, neglecting
atmospheric effects, a position accuracy below the 1 cm-level is possible for
much of the region near the Earth. The QPS may be used as a primary system to
define a global 4-dimensional reference frame.

generically computationally hard. Moreover, quantum mechanics provides simpler
derivations of certain matrix analysis results which we exemplify by showing
that the permanent of any unitary matrix takes its values across the unit disk
in the complex plane.

continuous-variable (CV) entangled states of light beams under mode
phase-locked conditions. We show that such quantum states can be generated in
self-phase locked nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator (NOPO) based on a
type-II phase-matched down-conversion combined with linear mixer of two
orthogonally polarized modes of the subharmonics in a cavity. A quantum theory
of this device, recently realized in the experiment, is developed for both
sub-threshold and above-threshold operational regimes. We show that the system
providing high level phase coherence between two generated modes, unlike to the
ordinary NOPO, also exhibits different types of quantum correlations between
photon numbers and phases of these modes. We quantify the CV entanglement as
two-mode squeezing and show that the maximal degree of the integral two-mode
squeezing(that is 50% relative to the level of vacuum fluctuations) is achieved
at the pump field intensity close to the generation threshold of self-phase
locked NOPO, provided that the constant of linear coupling between the two
polarizations is much less than the mode detunings. The peculiarities of CV
entanglement for the case of unitary, non-dissipative dynamics of the system
under consideration is also cleared up.

complementarity, which, in its strongest version, was originally formulated
only for sharp observables. As an illustration of the general theory, the
