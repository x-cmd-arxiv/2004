reionization by the decay products of a scaling cosmic defect network. We show
that such network can make a significant contribution to the reionization

energy density has to be greater than about $10^{-11}$ of the background
density). We compute the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature, polarization
and temperature-polarization cross power spectrum and show that a contribution
to the observed optical depth due to the decay products of a scaling defect
network may help to reconcile a high optical depth with a low redshift of
complete reionization suggested by quasar data. However, if the energy density
of defects is approximately a constant fraction of the background density then
these models do not explain the large scale bump in the
temperature-polarization cross power spectrum observed by WMAP.

decreasing flux by a factor of 30. The Chandra observations reveal increased

X-ray spectrum in the 0.2-2.0 keV band found during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey

with the spectrum becoming softer when the source becomes fainter. Best fitting

law, and a power law with partial covering absorption. The latter model
suggests a variable partial-covering absorber in the line of sight which can

Momentum injection is provided by (1) radiation pressure produced by the
continuum absorption and scattering of UV photons on dust grains and (2)
supernovae. UV radiation can be produced by a starburst or AGN activity. We
argue that momentum-driven winds are an efficient mechanism for feedback during
the formation of galaxies. We show that above a limiting luminosity, momentum
deposition from star formation can expel a significant fraction of the gas in a
galaxy. The limiting, Eddington-like luminosity is $L_{\rm M}\simeq(4f_g c/G)
\sigma^4$, where $\sigma$ is the galaxy velocity dispersion and $f_g$ is the
gas fraction. A starburst that attains $L_{\rm M}$ moderates its star formation
rate and its luminosity does not increase significantly further. We argue that
ellipticals attain this limit during their growth at $z \gtrsim 1$ and that
this is the origin of the Faber-Jackson relation. We show that Lyman break
galaxies and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies have luminosities near $L_{\rm
M}$. Star formation is unlikely to efficiently remove gas from very small
scales in galactic nuclei, i.e., scales much smaller than that of a nuclear
starburst. This gas is available to fuel a central black hole (BH). We argue
that a BH clears gas out of its galactic nucleus when the luminosity of the BH
itself reaches $\approx L_{\rm M}$. This shuts off the fuel supply to the BH
and may also terminate star formation in the surrounding galaxy. As a result,
the BH mass is fixed to be $M_{\rm BH}\simeq (f_g \kappa_{\rm es}/\pi
G^2)\sigma^4$, where $\kappa_{\rm es}$ is the electron scattering opacity. This
limit is in accord with the observed $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation. (Abridged)

paper, we investigate the local linear stability of differentially rotating,

the weak-field limit. We show that, when superthermal toroidal fields are
considered, the effects of both compressibility and magnetic tension forces,
which are related to the curvature of toroidal field lines, should be taken
fully into account. We demonstrate that the presence of a strong toroidal
component in the magnetic field plays a non-trivial role. When strong fields
are considered, the strength of the toroidal magnetic field not only modifies
the growth rates of the unstable modes but also determines which modes are
subject to instabilities. We find that, for rotating configurations with
Keplerian laws, the magnetorotational instability is stabilized at low
wavenumbers for toroidal Alfven speeds exceeding the geometric mean of the
sound speed and the rotational speed. We discuss the significance of our
findings for the stability of cold, magnetically dominated, rotating fluids and
argue that, for these systems, the curvature of toroidal field lines cannot be
neglected even when short wavelength perturbations are considered. We also
comment on the implications of our results for the validity of shearing box

variability as a means of identifying absorption lines arising in gas that is
intrinsic to the quasar central engine. We have compared archival HST/FOS
spectra of quasars with recent spectra obtained as part of our own snapshot
survey of the same objects with STIS. The intervals between observations are
4-10 years. We primarily focused on the C IV absorption lines, although we also
studied other lines available in the same spectra (e.g., Ly-alpha, N V, O VI).
Our main result is that 4 out of 15 quasars, or 4 out of 19 associated
absorption systems, contained variable narrow absorption lines, which are
indicative of intrinsic absorption. We conclude that a minimum of 21% of the
associated absorption-line systems are variable. Because not all systems will
have necessarily varied, this is a lower limit on this fraction and it is
consistent with previous estimates based on variability, partial coverage
analysis, or statistical arguments. If we interpret the upper limits on the
variability time scale as upper limits on the recombination time of the
absorber, we constrain the density of the absorber to be n_e > 3000 cm^{-3} and
its distance from the ionizing source to be R < 100pc. Moreover, we are now
able to pick out specific intrinsic absorption-line systems to be followed up
with high-dispersion spectroscopy in order to constrain the geometry, location,
and physical conditions of the absorber. We briefly illustrate how followup
studies can yield such constraints by means of a simulation.

derived using a novel method to determine the real space power spectrum and the

be determined quite reliably. We have taken the parameter $\beta$ equal to
0.45. But we have also checked that the results are changed very little, if we

leads to tighter constraints on quadratic and quartic potentials than in
general relativity. We investigate how this changes with a Gauss-Bonnet
correction term, which can be motivated by string theory. Randall-Sundrum
models preserve the standard consistency relation between the tensor spectral
index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The Gauss-Bonnet term breaks this
relation, and also modifies the dynamics and perturbation amplitudes at high
energies. We find that the Gauss-Bonnet term tends to soften the
Randall-Sundrum constraints. The observational compatibility of the quadratic
potential is strongly improved. For a broad range of energy scales, the quartic
potential is rescued from marginal rejection. Steep inflation driven by an
exponential potential is excluded in the Randall-Sundrum case, but the

  Inc. New York",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Since 1990's the detection of extremely energetic air showers and precise
astronomical measurements have proved that our knowledge about fundamental laws
of Nature is far from being complete. These observations have found convincing
evidences against two popular believes: The spectrum of Cosmic Rays would have
a steep cutoff at energies around $10^{19}eV$ (GZK cutoff) and the
contravortial quantity called Cosmological Constant (dark energy) should be
strictly zero. They have been important additions to the yet unsolved mystery
of the nature of dark matter.For both phenomena many models have been
suggested. The top-down model decay of a Superheavy Dark Matter(SDM), also
called WIMPZILLA as the origin of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) -
is one of the most favorite candidates. Here we show that a meaningful
constraints on the mass, lifetime and cosmological contribution of SDM is
possible only if the energy dissipation of the remnants is precisely taken into
account. We discuss the simulation of relevant processes and their evolution in
the cosmological environment. We show that such a dark matter can be the
dominant component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) with a relatively short lifetime.
Moreover, the equation of State of the Universe in this model fits the
Supernova type Ia data better than a stable dark matter. If a small fraction of
the mass of the SDM decays to an axion-like scalar field, its condensation can
also explain the dark energy without need for extreme fine tuning of the
parameters. Presumably, a meta-stable dark matter can explain 3 mysteries of
Physics and Cosmology. Finally we review some of the particle physics and
cosmological issues related to SDM and its associated quintessence field.

run from space with much better sky coverage and high level of signal to noise

major cause of concern for any weak lensing survey. One of the best ways of
spotting any undetected source of systematic noise is to compare surveys which
probe the same part of the sky. In this paper we study various measures which
are useful in cross correlating weak lensing surveys with diverse survey
strategies. Using two different statistics - the shear components and the
aperture mass - we construct a class of estimators which encode such
cross-correlations. These techniques will also be useful in studies where the
entire source population from a specific survey can be divided into various
redshift bins to study cross correlations among them. We perform a detailed
study of the angular size dependence and redshift dependence of these
observables and of their sensitivity to the background cosmology. We find that
one-point and two-point statistics provide complementary tools which allow one
to constrain cosmological parameters and to obtain a simple estimate of the
noise of the survey.

motivated by the fact that the present paper is devoted to the derivation and
the validation of the method but more complicated functionals can and will be
implemented in the future. This new method is applied in the microcanonical
ensemble, the most natural ensemble for molecular dynamics simulations. This
avoids the introduction of a thermostat in the simulation, and thus uncontroled
modifications of the trajectories calculated from the forces between particles.
The calculations are conducted for three values of the input thermodynamic
quantities, energy and density, and for different total numbers of particles in
order to examine the uncertainties due to finite size effects. This method and
these calculations lie the basic foundation to study the thermodynamic
stability of dense mixtures, without any {\it a priori} assumption on the

and $C_{\kappa}$ associated with the common closures for turbulence production,
dissipation and diffusion. In the case of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence,
these parameters are expected to be statistically scale-invariant within the
inertial subrange. In order to scrutinise this conjecture, we utilised a
generalisation of the Germano filtering formalism, which is applicable to
compressible flows as well. The filtering of data obtained from
three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of forced isotropic turbulence
with Mach numbers in the range $\sim 0.1...1$ then yielded values of the
closure parameters associated with different length scales. The results
indicate that the closure parameters are nearly universal for subsonic or
moderately transonic flows, although the resolution of $432^{3}$ grid cells in
our simulations is not quite sufficient to clearly establish scale invariance.
In addition, it was found that the customary assumption of a kinetic Prandtl
number of about unity for the gradient-diffusion closure is flawed due to the
misalignment between turbulent flux and the gradient of the turbulence energy.
Nevertheless, sound correlation can be achieved if the flux magnitude rather
than the flux vector is locally matched. This conclusion is particularly useful
for the family of subgrid scale models based on the turbulence energy equation.
Furthermore, the parameter of production $C_{\nu}$ was computed in the fashion
of dynamical procedures. Thereby, superior agreement between modelled and
explicitly evaluated turbulence stresses in comparison to the eddy-viscosity
closure with constant $C_{\nu}$ was verified.

highly structured over a vast range of scales.
  To describe cosmic structures, we need to build mathematically quantifiable
descriptions of structure. Identifying where scaling laws apply and the nature
of those scaling laws is an important part of understanding which physical
mechanisms have been responsible for the organization of clusters,
superclusters of galaxies and the voids between them. Finding where these
scaling laws are broken is equally important since this indicates the
transition to different underlying physics.
  In describing scaling laws we are helped by making analogies with fractals:
mathematical constructs that can possess a wide variety of scaling properties.
We must beware, however, of saying that the Universe is a fractal on some range
of scales: it merely exhibits a specific kind of fractal-like behavior on those
scales. We exploit the richness of fractal scaling behavior merely as an
important supplement to the usual battery of statistical descriptors.

Universe and present the data and methodologies that are relevant to the
question of discovering and understanding any scaling properties that structure
may have. The ultimate goal is to have a complete understanding of how that

interlayer phase coherent state and the weakly-coupled compressible phase moves

Qu{\'{e}}merais [Mod. Phys. Lett. B {\bf 12} 1003 (1998)]. We take into account
the Wigner crystal normal modes rather than a single mean frequency in the
minimization procedure of the variational free energy. We calculate the
renormalized modes of the crystal as well as the charge polarization
correlation function and polaron radius. The solid phase boundaries are
determined via a Lindemann criterion, suitably generalized to take into account
the classical-to-quantum cross-over.
  In the weak electron-phonon coupling limit, the Wigner crystal parameters are
renormalized by the electron-phonon interaction leading to a stabilization of
the solid phase for low polarizability of the medium. Conversely, at
intermediate and strong coupling, the behavior of the system depends strongly
on the polarizability of the medium.
  For weakly polarizable media, a density crossover occurs inside the solid
phase when the renormalized plasma frequency approaches the phonon frequency.
At low density, we have a renormalized polaron Wigner crystal, while at higher
densities the electron-phonon interaction is weakened irrespective of the {\it
bare} electron-phonon coupling.
  For strongly polarizable media, the system behaves as a Lorentz lattice of
dipoles. The abrupt softening of the internal polaronic frequency predicted by
Fratini and Quemerais is observed near the actual melting point only at very
strong coupling, leading to a possible liquid polaronic phase for a wider range
of parameters.

how to predict performance of parallel Mixed Bayesian Optimization Algorithm
(MBOA) that is based on parallel construction of Bayesian networks with
decision trees. We determine the time complexity of parallel Mixed Bayesian
Optimization Algorithm and compare this complexity with experimental results
obtained by solving the spin glass optimization problem. The empirical results
fit well the theoretical time complexity, so the scalability and efficiency of
parallel Mixed Bayesian Optimization Algorithm for unknown instances of spin
glass benchmarks can be predicted. Furthermore, we derive the guidelines that
can be used to design effective parallel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms
with the speedup proportional to the number of variables in the problem.

calculated in a number of different ways, particularly in the
transverse-traceless and the local Lorentz gauges. At first sight, it would
appear that these calculations lead to different results when the separation
between the test masses becomes comparable to the wavelength of the
gravitational wave. In this paper this discrepancy is resolved. We describe the
response of free test masses to plane gravitational waves in the coordinate
frame of a local observer and show that it acquires contributions from three
different effects: the displacement of the test masses, the apparent change in
the photon velocity, and the variation in the clock speed of the local
observer, all of which are induced by the gravitational wave. Only when taken
together do these three effects represent a quantity which is translationally
invariant. This translationally-invariant quantity is identical to the response
function calculated in the transverse-traceless gauge. We thus resolve the
well-known discrepancy between the two coordinates systems, and show that the
results found in the coordinate frame of a local observer are valid for large
separation between the masses.

play an important role in dipole operators, and we focus on these terms. We
derive from experiment new correlated constraints on the quark mixing angles

constrain even quark mixing parameters that do not enter in the CKM matrix.

constraining future ETC model building, but plausibly in the range suggested by
the size of the CKM elements. These values still allow substantial deviations

the simple observation that a three-brane in a six-dimensional bulk is flat. A
model is presented in which Standard Model vacuum energy is always absorbed by
the transverse space. The latter is a tear-drop like space with a conical
singularity, which preserves bulk supersymmetry and gives rise to conventional
macroscopic 4D gravity with no cosmological constant. Its cone acts like a
drain, depleting vacuum energy from the three-brane to the tear drop increasing
its volume. We stress that although gravity is treated classically, Standard
Model is handled quantum-field theoretically and the model is robust against
Standard Model corrections and particular details. The price paid is the
presence of boundaries which are nevertheless physically harmless by
appropriate boundary conditions.

approximation of the previous treatments and are valid at large coordinate
distances from the boundary at a finite time and up-to a finite coordinate
distance from the boundary at late time. In this region of validity our
regularization produces a certain singular term that is precisely canceled by
the collective field theory counter term in the present background. The energy
and momentum densities fall off exponentially at large distance from the

shows that the radiated energy reaches the asymptotic region signaling the

call the {\it zig-zag product}. Taking a product of a large graph with a small
graph, the resulting graph inherits (roughly) its size from the large one, its
degree from the small one, and its expansion properties from both! Iteration
yields simple explicit constructions of constant-degree expanders of arbitrary
size, starting from one constant-size expander.
  Crucial to our intuition (and simple analysis) of the properties of this
graph product is the view of expanders as functions which act as ``entropy
wave"" propagators -- they transform probability distributions in which entropy
is concentrated in one area to distributions where that concentration is
dissipated. In these terms, the graph products affords the constructive
interference of two such waves.
  Subsequent work [ALW01], [MW01] relates the zig-zag product of graphs to the
standard semidirect product of groups, leading to new results and constructions
on expanding Cayley graphs.

  First, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $Q$ so that the
quadratic form $<Q \cdot, \cdot>$ has zero relative bound with respect to the
Laplacian. For $Q\in L^1_{\rm loc}(\R^n)$, this property can be expressed in
the form of the integral inequality: $$

C(\epsilon) ||u||^2_{L^2(\R^n)}, \quad \forall u \in C^\infty_0(\R^n), $$ for

$C(\epsilon)$ in the above inequality is subject to the condition $C(\epsilon)
\le c {\epsilon^{-\beta}}$ ($\beta>0$) as $\epsilon\to +0$. Such quadratic form
inequalities can be understood entirely in the framework of Morrey--Campanato
spaces, using mean oscillations of $\nabla (1-\Delta)^{-1} Q$ and

surely, or almost surely converges to a quasistationary distribution given by
the lowest eigenfunction of the generator. In the absence of internal killing,
only a sufficiently strong inward drift can keep the process close to the
origin, to allow convergence in distribution. An alternative, that arises when
general killing is allowed, is that the conditioned process is held near the
origin by a high rate of killing near infinity. We also extend, to the case of
general killing, the standard result on convergence to a quasistationary
distribution of a diffusion on a compact interval.

constants appears to be preserved in both approaches. Furthermore, in
Hartree-Fock approximation, both QCD-scaled isovector coupling constants are
natural (dimensionless and of order 1) whereas in Hartree approximation only
that of the isovector-vector channel is natural. This indicates that it is not

explicit cost proportional to the duration of contests. We construct a model
where the time cost is not explicitly given, but instead depends implicitly on
the strategies of the whole population. We identify and analyse the underlying
mechanisms responsible for the implicit time cost. Each player participates in
a series of games, where those prepared to wait longer win with higher
certainty but play less frequently. The model is characterised by the ratio of
the winner's score to the loser's score, in a single game. The fitness of a
player is determined by the accumulated score from the games played during a
generation. We derive the stationary distribution of strategies under the
replicator dynamics. When the score ratio is high, we find that the stationary
distribution is unstable, with respect to both evolutionary and dynamical
stability, and the dynamics converge to a limit cycle. When the ratio is low,
the dynamics converge to the stationary distribution. For an intermediate
interval of the ratio, the distribution is dynamically but not evolutionarily
stable. Finally, the implications of our results for previous models based on
the war of attrition are discussed.

Warren, and Pieter Rein ten Wolde","Sampling rare switching events in biochemical networks","9 pages, 6 figures, last page contains supplementary information",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.018104",,"q-bio.MN",,"  Bistable biochemical switches are ubiquitous in gene regulatory networks and
signal transduction pathways. Their switching dynamics, however, are difficult
to study directly in experiments or conventional computer simulations, because
switching events are rapid, yet infrequent. We present a simulation technique
that makes it possible to predict the rate and mechanism of flipping of
biochemical switches. The method uses a series of interfaces in phase space
between the two stable steady states of the switch to generate transition
trajectories in a ratchet-like manner. We demonstrate its use by calculating
the spontaneous flipping rate of a symmetric model of a genetic switch
consisting of two mutually repressing genes. The rate constant can be obtained
orders of magnitude more efficiently than using brute-force simulations. For
this model switch, we show that the switching mechanism, and consequently the
switching rate, depends crucially on whether the binding of one regulatory
protein to the DNA excludes the binding of the other one. Our technique could
also be used to study rare events and non-equilibrium processes in soft
condensed matter systems.

Parthasarathy [Ann. Henri Poincar\'e (to appear), quant-ph/0307182, [1]]. Here
we present an alternative necessary and sufficient condition for a state with
given marginals to be extremal. Our approach is based on a canonical duality
between bipartite states and a certain class of completely positive maps and
has the advantage that it is easier to check and to construct explicit examples
of extremal states. In dimension 2 x 2 we give a simple new proof for the fact
that all extremal states with maximally mixed marginals are precisely the
projectors onto maximally entangled wave functions. We also prove that in
higher dimension this does not hold and construct an explicit example of an
extremal state with maximally mixed marginals in dimension 3 x 3 that is not
maximally entangled. Generalizations of this result to higher dimensions are
also discussed.

dynamical evolution has been applied successfully in the framework of the Lee
model, [M. de Haan. Ann. Phys., 311, 314-349 (2004)] enabling a kinetic
extension of the description. The basic ingredient is the recognition of these
self-energy parts. [M. de Haan and C. George. Trends in Statistical Physics 3
(2000), 115] The original reversible description is embedded in the new one and
appears now as a restricted class of initial conditions. [M. de Haan and C.
George. Prog. Theor. Phys.,109, 881-909 (2003)] This program is realized here
in the reduced formalism for a scalar field, interacting with a two-level atom,
beyond the usual rotating wave approximation. The kinetic evolution operator,
previously surmised, [M. de Haan. Physica, A171 (1991), 159] is here derived
from first principles, justifying the usual practice in optics where the common
use of the so-called pole approximation should no longer be viewed as an
approximation but as an alternative description in the appropriate formalism.
That model illustrates how some dressing of the atomic levels (and vertices),
through an appropriate operator, finds its place naturally into the new
formalism since the bare and dressed ground states do no longer coincide.
Moreover, finite velocity for field propagation is now possible in all cases,
without the presence of precursors for multiple detections.
