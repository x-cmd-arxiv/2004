Ni-56 mixing on the bolometric light curve of SN 1987A in terms of radiation
hydrodynamics in the one-group approximation by abandoning LTE and by taking
into account nonthermal ionization and the contribution of spectral lines to
opacity. Our study shows that moderate Ni-56 mixing at velocities of < 2500
km/s can explain the observed light curve if the density of the outer layers of
the presupernova exceeds the value obtained in the evolutionary model of a
single nonrotating star severalfold. Abandoning LTE and allowing for nonthermal
ionization when solving the equation of state and calculating the mean
opacities and the thermal emission coefficient leads to a significant
difference between the gas temperature and the radiation temperature in the
optically thin layers of the supernova envelope. We demonstrate the fundamental
role of the contribution of spectral lines to the opacity in an expanding
envelope and of the accurate description of radiative transfer in reproducing
the observed shape of the bolometric light curve. We have found that
disregarding the contribution of spectral lines to the opacity introduces an
error of 20% into the explosion energy, and that a similar error is possible
when determining the mass of the ejected matter. The resonant scattering of
radiation in numerous lines accelerates the outer layers to velocities of 36
000 km/s; this additional acceleration affects the outer layers with a mass of
10^{-6} Msun. Proper calculations of the supernova luminosity require that not
only the delay effects, but also the limb-darkening effects be taken into
account.

(NGC 1068 and NGC 4736) we find evidence for a central bar pattern speed that
is greater than that of the surrounding spiral and roughly consistent with
previous estimates. However, the spiral pattern speed in both cases is much
larger than previous determinations. For the barred spirals NGC 3627 and NGC
4321, the method is insensitive to the bar pattern speed (the bar in each is
nearly parallel to the major axis; in this case the method will not work), but
for the former galaxy the spiral pattern speed found agrees with previous
estimates of the bar pattern speed, suggesting that these two structures are
part of a single pattern. For the latter, the spiral pattern speed found is in
agreement with several previous determinations. For the flocculent spiral NGC
4414 and the ``Evil Eye'' galaxy NGC 4826, the method does not support the
presence of a large-scale coherent pattern. We also apply the method to a

the far-infrared, attenuated by an extended region (size 2$''$) that is heated
mainly through absorption of nuclear infrared radiation. The molecular
absorption in the nuclear region is characterized by high excitation due to the
high infrared radiation density. The OH column densities are high toward the
nucleus and the extended region. The H$_2$O column density is also high toward
the nucleus and lower in the extended region. The column densities in a halo
are similar to what are found in the diffuse clouds toward Sgr B2 near the
Galactic Center. Most notable are the high column densities found for NH and
NH$_3$ toward the nucleus, with values of $\sim1.5\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
$\sim3\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. A combination of PDRs in the

possible shock contribution in the nuclei may explain the relative column

affected by cosmic ray ionization. The [C II] 158 $\mu$m line is well

(MCT) of the glass transition, having a memory term that depends on a density
variable, and on both the shear stress and the shear rate. (Tensorial aspects
of the rheology, such as normal stresses, are ignored for simplicity.) We
calculate steady-state flow curves and correlation functions. Depending on
model parameters, we find a range of rheological behaviours, including
`S-shaped' flow curves, indicating discontinuous shear thickening, and
stress-induced transitions from a fluid to a nonergodic (jammed) state, showing
zero flow rate in an interval of applied stress. The shear thickening and
jamming scenarios that we explore appear broadly consistent with experiments on
dense colloids close to the glass transition, despite the fact that we ignore
hydrodynamic interactions. In particular, the jamming transition we propose is
conceptually quite different from various hydrodynamic mechanisms of shear

rather surprising behavior in the low-temperature transport properties near
this transition. The in-plane magnetoresistivity $\rho$$_{ab}$(H) exhibits
ultrasharp steps as the magnetic field sweeps down through the transition.
Temperature sweeps of $\rho$$_{ab}$ for fields within the transition regime
show non-metallic behavior in the up-sweep cycle of magnetic field, but show a
significant drop in the down-sweep cycle. These observations indicate that the
transition occurs via a new electronic phase separation process; a lowly
polarized state is mixed with a ferromagnetic state within the transition
regime.

Hydrodynamical(GRH) equations with Adaptive-Mesh Refinement (AMR) is presented.
In order to achieve, the GRH equations are written in the conservation form to
exploit their hyperbolic character. The numerical solutions of general
relativistic hydrodynamic equations are done by High Resolution Shock Capturing
schemes (HRSC), specifically designed to solve non-linear hyperbolic systems of
conservation laws. These schemes depend on the characteristic information of
the system. The Marquina fluxes with MUSCL left and right states are used to
solve GRH equations. First, different test problems with uniform and AMR grids
on the special relativistic hydrodynamics equations are carried out to verify
the second order convergence of the code in 1D, 2D and 3D. Results from uniform
and AMR grid are compared. It is found that adaptive grid does a better job
when the number of resolution is increased. Second, the general relativistic
hydrodynamical equations are tested using two different test problems which are
Geodesic flow and Circular motion of particle In order to this, the flux part
of GRH equations is coupled with source part using Strang splitting. The
coupling of the GRH equations is carried out in a treatment which gives second
order accurate solutions in space and time.

Hausel-Thaddeus which claims that certain Hodge numbers of moduli spaces of

agree. We then change our point of view in the non-Abelian Hodge theory of the
curve, and concentrate on the SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C) character varieties of the
curve. Here we discuss a recent conjecture of Hausel-Rodriguez-Villegas which
claims, analogously to the above conjecture, that certain Hodge numbers of
these character varieties also agree. We explain that for Hodge numbers of
character varieties one can use arithmetic methods, and thus we end up
explicitly calculating, in terms of Verlinde-type formulas, the number of
representations of the fundamental group into the finite groups SL(n,F_q) and
PGL(n,F_q), by using the character tables of these finite groups of Lie type.
Finally we explain a conjecture which enhances the previous result, and gives a
simple formula for the mixed Hodge polynomials, and in particular for the
Poincare polynomials of these character varieties, and detail the relationship
to results of Hitchin, Gothen, Garsia-Haiman and Earl-Kirwan. One consequence
of this conjecture is a curious Poincare duality type of symmetry, which leads
to a conjecture, similar to Faber's conjecture on the moduli space of curves,
about a strong Hard Lefschetz theorem for the character variety, which can be
considered as a generalization of both the Alvis-Curtis duality in the

  In this paper we shall explain some new conjectures for symmetric functions
which imply (C2) and (C3) for almost collinear configurations. Computations up
to n=6 are performed with a help of Maple and J. Stembridge's package SF for
symmetric functions. For n=4 the conjectures (C2) and (C3) we have also
verified for some infinite families of tetrahedra. This is a joint work with I.
Urbiha.
  Finally we mention that by minimizing a geometrically defined energy,
figuring in these conjectures, one gets a connection to some complicated
physical theories, such as Skyrmions and Fullerenes.

calculated self-consistently for a configuration corresponding to a
direct-current, cylindrically symmetric, warm-fluid Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij
equilibrium. The colored noise arises from unavoidable machine errors and
influences the internal space-charge force. Its presence quickly launches
statistically rare particles to ever-growing amplitudes by continually kicking
them back into phase with the collective-mode oscillations. The halo amplitude
is essentially the same for purely radial orbits as for orbits that are
initially purely azimuthal; orbital angular momentum has no statistically
significant impact. Factors that do have an impact include the amplitudes of
the collective modes and the strength and autocorrelation time of the colored
noise. The underlying dynamics ensues because the noise breaks the
Kolmogorov-Arnol'd-Moser tori that otherwise would confine the beam. These tori
are fragile; even very weak noise will eventually break them, though the time
scale for their disintegration depends on the noise strength. Both collective
modes and noise are therefore centrally important to the dynamics of halo
formation in real beams.

innovation or/and by imitation of other firm's technological and organizational
solutions. The type of network-connectivity determines how fast and how

behaviors will be imitated. From a model for innovation flow through a complex
network we obtain that the expectation values of the productivity level are
proportional to the connectivity of the network of links between firms. The

catalytic action of superheavy negative particles making up the Galactic Dark
Matter. We called them DArk Electric Matter Objects, or daemons. The daemons
are assumed to be elementary black holes (M ~ 10^-5 g) carrying a charge of up
to Ze = 10e. Experiments have culminated in 2000 by the discovery of daemons.
We used the two-screen scintillation technique with a scintillator ZnS(Ag).
Measurements showed the daemon flux striking the Earth to be ~10^-9 cm^-2s^-1
for an object velocity of as low as ~<10-30 km/s. The half-year periodicity of
the flux was revealed, which can be assigned to daemons being captured into
helio- and geocentric orbits as the Solar system moves through the DM
background (see astro-ph/0402367). The next step in creating a daemon-mediated
BL to achieve controlled energy generation through catalytic fusion of carbon
nuclei will be a search for methods of capture and stable holding of a daemon,
which could involve the use of the tip of a carbon fiber, as it apparently
occurs in nature.

the underlying network resemble those of real biological networks.
Specifically, instead of using a random graph topology, we deal with a complex
heterogeneous network characterized by a power-law degree distribution coupled
to a continuous dynamics for each network's component. The dynamics of the
model is very rich and stationary, periodic and chaotic states are observed
upon variation of the model's parameters. We characterize these states
numerically and report on several quantities such as the system's phase diagram
and size distributions of clusters of stationary, periodic and chaotic nodes.
The results are discussed in view of recent debate about the ubiquity of
complex networks in nature and on the basis of several biological processes
that can be well described by the dynamics studied.
