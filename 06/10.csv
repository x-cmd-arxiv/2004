close Earth fly-by in August 2002 with TIMMI2 at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. The
photometric measurement allowed us to derive a radiometric diameter of
0.28+/-0.03 km and an albedo of 0.34+/-0.06 through the near-Earth asteroid
thermal model (NEATM) and a thermophysical model (TPM). The values are in
agreement with results from radar data, visual and near-IR observations. In
this first comparison between these two model approaches we found that the
empirical NEATM beaming parameter $\eta$=1.0 corresponds to a thermal inertia
values of about 100 $\mathrm{J m^{-2} s^{-0.5} K^{-1}}$ for a typical range of
surface roughness, assuming an equator-on viewing angle. Our TPM analysis
indicated that the surface of 2002 NY40 consists of rocky material with a thin
or no dust regolith. The asteroid very likely has a prograde sense of rotation
with a cold terminator at the time of our observations. Although both model
approaches can fit the thermal spectra taken at phase angles of 22$^{\circ}$
and 59$^{\circ}$, we did not find a consistent model solution that describes
all pieces of photometric and spectroscopic data. In addition to the 2002 NY40
analysis, we discuss the possibilities to distinguish between different models
with only very few photometric and/or spectroscopic measurements spread over a
range of phase angles.

We obtain statistically superior fits using a two component model consisting of
a pair of r^{1/4} profiles with independent scale lengths, ellipticities, and
orientations. The two component model can simply reproduce the observed
position angle and ellipticity gradients, which cannot generally be explained
purely by triaxiality. The inner component of our two component model has
properties similar to a typical massive elliptical galaxy and is clearly
associated with the BCG. The outer component is 10-40 times larger in scale,
has ~10 times the total luminosity of the inner component, and exhibits a
steeper <\mu>-r_e relation than that of the elliptical fundamental plane. We
interpret this outer component as a population of intracluster stars tracing
the cluster potential. The two components are strongly aligned
(|\Delta\theta|<10\degr) in roughly 40% of the clusters. When they are not
aligned, the components tend toward high degrees of misalignment, suggesting
that accretion of infalling material may change the orientation of some BCGs
for a time. The extent of the outer component and its similar elongation to
published cluster galaxy distributions indicates that the evolution of the
intracluster light is tied to the cluster as a whole rather than to the BCG.

a more concentrated dark matter distribution. The response of dark matter to
the condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabatic
contraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. In contrast,
halos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple
violent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halos
are highly eccentric. We study the effects of the cooling of gas in the inner
regions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations which include
gas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. We find that the
dissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens its
radial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case without
cooling. For the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model in
cosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematically
overpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5% of the virial
radius. We show that the model can be improved by a simple modification of the
assumed invariant from M(r)r to M(r_av)r, where r and r_av are the current and
orbit-averaged particle positions. This modification approximately accounts for
orbital eccentricities of particles and reproduces simulation profiles to
within 10-20%. We present analytical fitting functions that accurately describe
the transformation of the dark matter profile in the modified model and can be
used for interpretation of observations.

EGRET data used is extended to 100 GeV. The models are computed with our
GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation and gamma-ray production code. We confirm that
the ""conventional model"" based on the locally observed electron and nucleon
spectra is inadequate, for all sky regions. A conventional model plus hard
sources in the inner Galaxy is also inadequate, since this cannot explain the
GeV excess away from the Galactic plane. Models with a hard electron injection
spectrum are inconsistent with the local spectrum even considering the expected
fluctuations; they are also inconsistent with the EGRET data above 10 GeV.
  We present a new model which fits the spectrum in all sky regions adequately.
Secondary antiproton data were used to fix the Galactic average proton
spectrum, while the electron spectrum is adjusted using the spectrum of diffuse
emission itself. The derived electron and proton spectra are compatible with
those measured locally considering fluctuations due to energy losses,
propagation, or possibly details of Galactic structure. This model requires a
much less dramatic variation in the electron spectrum than models with a hard
electron injection spectrum, and moreover it fits the gamma-ray spectrum better
and to the highest EGRET energies. It gives a good representation of the
latitude distribution of the gamma-ray emission from the plane to the poles,
and of the longitude distribution. We show that secondary positrons and

high temperatures, it has been suggested that the observed close orbiting
($\sim 0.05$ AU) large mass planets ($\sim M_J$) might be mirror worlds --
planets composed predominately of mirror matter. The accretion of ordinary
matter onto the mirror planet (from e.g. the solar wind from the host star)
will make the mirror planet opaque to ordinary radiation with an effective
radius $R_p$. It was argued in a previous paper, astro-ph/0101055, that this
radius was potentially large enough to explain the measured size of the first
transiting close-in extrasolar planet, HD209458b. Furthermore,
astro-ph/0101055, made the rough prediction: $R_p \propto \sqrt{{T_s \over
M_p}}$, where $T_s$ is the surface temperature of the ordinary matter in the
mirror planet and $M_p$ is the mass of the planet (the latter dependence being
the more robust prediction). We compare this prediction with the recently
discovered transiting planets, OGLE-TR-56b and OGLE-TR-113b.

study the expected number densities of PBHs in the relevant mass range for
several classes of spectra of primordial density fluctuations and confront the

used to constrain shock model parameters and determine the origin of the
emission. Previous work has shown that it is likely that the atomic and ionic
emission arises in regions of higher ionization than the molecular emission. On
the basis of observations, it has often been suggested that the [Fe II] and [C
I] emission could arise, for example, at the apex of a bow shock, with the H2
emission produced in the wings. Accordingly, we have combined models of
C-component and J-type shocks in order to reproduce the observed H2, [Fe II]
and [C I] line spectra. We can account for the H2 emission towards the HH99B
complex by means of J-type shocks with magnetic precursors. We derive shock
velocities of about 30 km s-1 and ages of order 100 yr; the pre-shock gas has a
density of approximately 10^4 cm-3 and the magnetic field is approximately 100
mu G. The J-type shocks required to reproduce the intensities of the observed
[Fe II] and [C I] lines have velocities of 50 km s-1. It is necessary to assume
that Fe has been previously eroded from grains, probably by the earlier passage
of a C-type shock wave. Thus, our analysis supports the view that molecular
outflows are episodic phenomena whose observed emission arises in shock waves.

luminosity, which are generally ascribed to a sudden increase of mass accretion
rate in the surrounding protostellar disc. Models invoking a thermal
instability in the disc are able to reproduce many features of the outburst,
but cannot explain the rapid rise time-scale observed in many cases. Here we
explore the possibility (originally suggested by Clarke & Syer 1996) that the
thermal instability is triggered away from the disc inner edge (at a distance
of $\approx 10R_{\odot}$ from the central protostar) due to the presence of a
massive planet embedded in the disc. We have constructed simple,
one-dimensional, time-dependent models of the disc evolution, taking into
account both the interaction between the disc and the planet, and the thermal
evolution of the disc. We are indeed able to reproduce rapid rise outbursts
(with rise time-scale $\approx 1$ yr), with a planet mass
$M_{\mathrm{s}}=10-15M_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$. We show that the luminosity and the
duration of the outbursts are increasing functions of planet mass. We also show
that the inward migration of the planet is significantly slowed once it reaches
the radius where it is able to trigger FU Orionis outbursts, thus suggesting
that a single planet may be involved in triggering several outbursts.

therefore > 17 and possibly considerably higher. For such stars the lambda Boo
classification should be reconsidered taking into account the fact that their
spectra are composite. We argue that some of the underabundances reported in
the literature may simply be the result of the failure to consider the
composite nature of the spectra. This leads to the legitimate suspicion that
some, if not all, the lambda Boo candidates are not chemically peculiar at all.
A thorough analysis of even a single one of the lambda Boo candidates with
composite spectra, in which the composite nature of the spectrum is duly

two Gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue and
red population. At fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red)
distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant
(~3sigma) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14
(0.03-0.06) mag with a factor ~100 increase in local density, as characterised
by the surface density of galaxies within a +/-1000 km/s redshift slice. In
contrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distribution
is a strong function of local density, increasing from ~10-30 per cent of the
population in the lowest density environments, to ~70 per cent at the highest
densities. The strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest

red galaxies within the virialised regions of clusters shows no significant
dependence on velocity dispersion. Even at the lowest densities explored, a
substantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. We
propose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is
determined primarily by their intrinsic properties, and independent of their
environment. Any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red
colors must either occur on a short timescale, or preferentially at high
redshift, to preserve the simple Gaussian nature of the color distribution. The
mechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.

the nanocluster with regions of prevailing Kondo or RKKY correlations. The
interplay of $\Delta$ and disorder gives rise to a $\Delta$ versus
concentration T=0 phase diagram very rich in structure. The parity of the total
number of electrons alters the competition between the Kondo and RKKY
correlations. The local Kondo temperatures, $T_K$, and RKKY interactions depend
strongly on the local environment and are overall {\it enhanced} by disorder,

a sharp increase at the magnetically determined bulk upper-critical fields
Hc2(T). Above these points the resistance curves are rounded, attaining the
normal state value at much higher fields identified as the surface
superconductivity fields Hc3(T). When plotted in reduced temperature units, the
characteristic field lines Hc3(T) of the HS and of a pure Nb film, prepared at
exactly the same conditions, coincide for H<10 kOe, while for fields H>10 kOe
they strongly segregate. Interestingly, the characteristic value H=10 kOe is
equal to the saturation field of the MN. The behavior mentioned above is
observed only for the case where the field is normal to the HS, while is absent
when the field is parallel to the film. Our experimental results suggest that
the observed enhancement of surface superconductivity field Hc3(T) is possibly
due to the not uniform local reduction of the external magnetic field by the
dipolar fields of the MN.

state, which itself is a doped-Mott-insulator and can correctly reduce to an
antiferromagnetic (AF) state at half-filling with an AF long-range order
(AFLRO). Such a doped Mott insulator is described by a mean-field theory based
on the phase string formulation of the t-J model. We show that the spin wave
excitation in the AFLRO state at half-filling evolves into a resonancelike peak
at a finite energy in the superconducting state, which is located around the AF
wave vectors. The width of such a resonancelike peak in momentum space decides
a spin correlation length scale which is inversely proportional to the square
root of doping concentration, while the energy of the resonancelike peak scales
linearly with the doping concentration at low doping. An important prediction
of the theory is that, while the total spin sum rule is satisfied at different
doping concentrations, the weight of the resonancelike peak does not vanish,
but is continuously saturated to the weight of the AFLRO at zero-doping limit.
Besides the low-energy resonancelike peak, we also show that the high-energy
excitations still track the spin wave dispersion in momentum space,
contributing to a significant portion of the total spin sum rule. The
fluctuational effect beyond the mean-field theory is also examined, which is
related to the broadening of the resonancelike peak in energy space. In
particular, we discuss the incommensurability of the spin dynamics by pointing
out that its visibility is strongly tied to the low-energy fluctuations below
the resonancelike peak. We finally investigate the interlayer coupling effect
on the spin dynamics as a function of doping, by considering a bilayer system.

orbit around a Kerr black hole parameterized by a spin parameter q that takes
values between -1 and 1. In order to assess the performance of the two
approximants we measure their effectualness (i.e. larger overlaps with the
exact signal), and faithfulness (i.e. smaller biases while measuring the
parameters of the signal) with the exact (numerical) waveforms. We find that in
the case of prograde orbits, that is orbits whose angular momentum is in the
same sense as the spin angular momentum of the black hole, T-approximant
templates obtain an effectualness of ~ 0.99 for spins q < 0.75. For 0.75 < q <
0.95, the effectualness drops to about 0.82. The P-approximants achieve
effectualness of > 0.99 for all spins up to q = 0.95. The bias in the
estimation of parameters is much lower in the case of P-approximants than
T-approximants. We find that P-approximants are both effectual and faithful and
should be more effective than T-approximants as a detection template family
when q>0. For q<0 both T- and P-approximants perform equally well so that
either of them could be used as a detection template family.

the instrument will be able to resolve about 10000 such systems, with a large
fraction of them at frequencies above 3 mHz, where the wavelength of
gravitational waves becomes comparable to or shorter than the LISA arm-length.
This affects the structure of the so-called LISA transfer function which cannot
be treated as constant in this frequency range: it introduces characteristic
phase and amplitude modulations that depend on the source location in the sky
and the emission frequency. Here we investigate the effect of the LISA transfer
function on detection and parameter estimation for monochromatic sources. For
signal detection we show that filters constructed by approximating the transfer
function as a constant (long wavelength approximation) introduce a negligible
loss of signal-to-noise ratio -- the fitting factor always exceeds 0.97 -- for
f below 10mHz, therefore in a frequency range where one would actually expect
the approximation to fail. For parameter estimation, we conclude that in the

from about 5% up to a factor of 10 (depending on the actual source parameters

to violate spectral positivity. The most direct sign of the violation is the
rise of the effective mass as a function of distance. The origin of this
phenomenon lies in the quenched character of the auxiliary field $g$ used to
implement lattice gauge fixing, and is similar to quenched QCD in this respect.
This is best studied using the PJLZ formalism, leading to a class of covariant
gauges similar to the one-parameter class of covariant gauges commonly used in
continuum gauge theories. Soluble models are used to illustrate the origin of
the violation of spectral positivity. The phase diagram of the lattice theory,
as a function of the gauge coupling $\beta$ and the gauge-fixing parameter
$\alpha$, is similar to that of the unquenched theory, a Higgs model of a type
first studied by Fradkin and Shenker. The gluon propagator is interpreted as
yielding bound states in the confined phase, and a mixture of fundamental
particles in the Higgs phase, but lattice simulation shows the two phases are
connected. Gauge field propagators from the simulation of an SU(2) lattice
gauge theory on a $20^4$ lattice are well described by a quenched mass-mixing
model. The mass of the lightest state, which we interpret as the gluon mass,
appears to be independent of $\alpha$ for sufficiently large $\alpha$.

those of 10 and 126, thus acting as a perturbation in the fermion mass
generation. The antisymmetric nature of the 120 Yukawa coupling affects at
leading order the determination of the mixing angles and it allows to remove
the inconsistencies between predictions and data on the neutrino parameters. An
improvement in the experimental bound on |Ue3| can tell this scenario from the

end of hybrid inflation. However, the WMAP CMB measurements strongly constrain
the possible cosmic strings contribution to the angular power spectrum of
anisotropies. We investigate the parameter space of SUSY hybrid (F- and D-
term) inflation, to get the conditions under which theoretical predictions are
in agreement with data. The predictions of F-term inflation are in agreement
with data, only if the superpotential coupling $\kappa$ is small. In
particular, for SUSY SO(10), the upper bound is $\kappa\lsim 7\times 10^{-7}$.
This fine tuning problem can be lifted if we employ the curvaton mechanism, in
which case $\kappa\lsim 8\times 10^{-3}$; higher values are not allowed by the
gravitino constraint. The constraint on $\kappa$ is equivalent to a constraint
on the SSB mass scale $M$, namely $M \lsim 2\times 10^{15}$ GeV. The study of
D-term inflation shows that the inflaton field is of the order of the Planck
scale; one should therefore consider SUGRA. We find that the cosmic strings
contribution to the CMB anisotropies is not constant, but it is strongly
dependent on the gauge coupling $g$ and on the superpotential coupling
$\lambda$. We obtain $g\lsim 2\times 10^{-2}$ and $\lambda \lsim 3\times
10^{-5}$. SUGRA corrections induce also a lower limit for $\lambda$.
Equivalently, the Fayet-Iliopoulos term $\xi$ must satisfy $\sqrt\xi \lsim
2\times 10^{15}$ GeV. This constraint holds for all allowed values of $g$.

vortices that furnishes an approach to the determination of so-called k-string
tensions. This model is constructed from string-like quantum solitons
introduced previously, and exploits the well-known relation between string
partition functions and scalar field theories in d=3. Center vortices
corresponding to magnetic flux J (in units of 2\pi /N) are composites of J
elementary J=1 constituent vortices that come in N-1 types, with repulsion
between like constituents and attraction between unlike constituents. The
scalar field theory involves N scalar fields \phi_i (one of which is
eliminated) that can merge, dissociate, and recombine while conserving flux mod
N. The properties of these fields are deduced directly from the corresponding
gauge-theory quantum solitons. Every vacuum Feynman graph of the theory
corresponds to a real-space configuration of center vortices. We study
qualitatively the problem of k-string tensions at large N, whose solution is
far from obvious in center-vortex language. We construct a simplified dynamical
picture of constituent-vortex merging, dissociation, and recombination, which
allows in principle for the determination of vortex areal densities and
k-string tensions. This picture involves point-like ""molecules"" (cross-sections
of center vortices) made of constituent ""atoms"" that combine and disassociate
dynamically in a d=2 test plane . The vortices evolve in a Euclidean ""time""
which is the location of the test plane along an axis perpendicular to the
plane. A simple approximation to the molecular dynamics is compatible with
k-string tensions that are linear in k for k<< N, as naively expected.

paper we study the wider class of compact G-systems which can be linearly
represented as a weak*-compact subset of a dual Banach space with the
Radon-Nikodym property. We call such a system a Radon-Nikodym system (RN). One
of our main results is to show that for metrizable compact G-systems the three
classes: RN, HNS (hereditarily not sensitive) and HAE (hereditarily almost
equicontinuous) coincide. We investigate these classes and their relation to
previously studied classes of G-systems such as WAP and LE (locally
equicontinuous). We show that the Glasner-Weiss examples of
recurrent-transitive locally equicontinuous but not weakly almost periodic

property is equivalent to having a countable phase space; and that any

important to note that the existence of an Anosov automorphism is a really
strong condition on an infranilmanifold. Any Anosov automorphism determines an
automorphism of the (rational) Lie algebra of the Mal'cev completion of the
corresponding lattice which is hyperbolic and unimodular. These two conditions
together are strong enough to make of such rational nilpotent Lie algebras

classify Anosov Lie algebras of dimension less or equal than 8, which also
classify nilmanifolds admitting an Anosov diffeomorphism in those dimensions.

When the anisotropic LANS-$\alpha$ equations are written with the Stokes

traditional fuels used in their traditional ways will become increasingly
unable to meet the demand. The need for a review of the energy sources
available is paramount, although the subsequent need to develop a realistic
strategy to deal with all local and global energy requirements is almost as
important. Here attention will be restricted to examining some of the claims
and problems of using nuclear power to attempt to solve this major question.

simulated by PIC-MCC method. The results were obtained in pressure range 50-300
mTorr and voltage range 40-180 V for discharge frequency 13.56 MHz. The
electron energy and electron--methane reaction rates spatial distributions show
existence of two regimes of discharge glow: a) with active sheaths, when
electrons are hot in electrode sheaths and cold in the middle of discharge so
the electron-neutral reactions strongly dominate in sheaths regions; b) with
volume domination, when the electron energy is more uniform and the reactions
take place in all discharge volume. The second regime is usually observed for
low discharge voltages, and turns to the first one with voltage increasing.
Besides, simulation of chemical reactions in methane plasma was also fulfilled
to find the gas mixture composition in discharge volume. The results are in
agreement with the known experimental data.

breaking of the symmetry on the intensities of these two waves in agreement

suggests that the weakly nonlinear theory captures the adequate physics of the
instability. When antagonistic (attractive/repulsive) molecular forces are
considered, nonlinear saturation of the instability becomes possible. We show
that the stability boundaries are determined by the van der Waals potential
alone.

channel conformation and function with specific reference to the case of the
mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). In a recent paper
(Wiggins and Phillips, 2004), we argued that mechanotransduction very naturally
arises from lipid-protein interactions by invoking a simple analytic model of
the MscL channel and the surrounding lipid bilayer. In this paper, we focus on
improving and expanding this analytic framework for studying lipid-protein
interactions with special attention to MscL. Our goal is to generate simple
scaling relations which can be used to provide qualitative understanding of the
role of membrane mechanics in protein function and to quantitatively interpret
experimental results. For the MscL channel, we find that the free energies
induced by lipid-protein interaction are of the same order as the free energy
differences between conductance states measured by Sukharev et al. (1999). We
therefore conclude that the mechanics of the bilayer plays an essential role in
determining the conformation and function of the channel. Finally, we compare
the predictions of our model to experimental results from the recent
investigations of the MscL channel by Perozo et al. (2002), Powl et al. (2003),
Yoshimura et al. (2004), and others and suggest a suite of new experiments.

been a beneficiary of these experimental techniques is the study of viruses. In
this paper we describe how the insights obtained from such experiments can be
utilized to construct physical models of processes in the viral life cycle. We
focus on dsDNA bacteriophages and show that the bending elasticity of DNA and
its electrostatics in solution can be combined to determine the forces
experienced during packaging and ejection of the viral genome. Furthermore, we
quantitatively analyze the effect of fluid viscosity and capsid expansion on
the forces experienced during packaging. Finally, we present a model for DNA
ejection from bacteriophages based on the hypothesis that the energy stored in
the tightly packed genome within the capsid leads to its forceful ejection. The
predictions of our model can be tested through experiments in vitro where DNA
ejection is inhibited by the application of external osmotic pressure.

states of spin chain Hamiltonians that are intrinsically time reversal
symmetric. We study the robustness of n-concurrence of ground states when the
interaction is subject to a time reversal antisymmetric magnetic field
perturbation. The n-concurrence in the ground state of the isotropic XX model
is computed and it is shown that there is a critical magnetic field strength at
which the entanglement experiences a jump discontinuity from the maximum value
to zero. The n-concurrence for thermal mixed states is derived and a threshold
temperature is computed below which the system has non zero entanglement.
