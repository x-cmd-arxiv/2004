104.9+2.4 in the K' band obtained with the 6m telescope of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). At a wavelength of lambda = 2.12 micron the
diffraction-limited resolution of 74 mas was attained. The reconstructed
visibility reveals a spherically symmetric, circumstellar dust shell (CDS)
surrounding the central star. The visibility function shows that the stellar
contribution to the total flux at lambda = 2.12 micron is less than ~50%,
indicating a rather large optical depth of the CDS. The azimuthally averaged
1-dimensional Gaussian visibility fit yields a diameter of 47 +/- 3mas (FHWM),
which corresponds to 112 +/- 13 AU for an adopted distance of D = 2.38 +/- 0.24
kpc. To determine the structure and the properties of the CDS of OH 104.9+2.4,
radiative transfer calculations using the code DUSTY were performed to
simultaneously model its visibility and the spectral energy distribution (SED).
We found that both the ISO spectrum and the visibility of OH 104.9+2.4 can be
well reproduced by a radiative transfer model with an effective temperature
T_eff = 2500 +/- 500 K of the central source, a dust temperature T_in = 1000
+/- 200 K at the inner shell boundary R_in = 9.1 R_star = 25.4 AU, an optical
depth tau = 6.5 +/- 0.3 at 2.2 micron, and dust grain radii ranging from a_min
= 0.005 +/- 0.003 micron to a_max = 0.2 +/- 0.02 micron with a power law with
index -3.5. It was found that even minor changes in a_max have a major impact
on both the slope and the curvature of the visibility function, while the SED
shows only minor changes. Our detailed analysis demonstrates the potential of
dust shell modeling constrained by both the SED and visibilities.

emission of both components. In addition, this allows the magnetic field to be
nearly in equipartition with the emitting particles. The inverse Compton
emission of the spine is anisotropic in its frame, possibly producing the

the slow layer is a relatively strong high energy emitter, and thus
radiogalaxies become potentially detectable by GLAST.

the stress from the magnetic field, suppressing the production of gravitational

when harmonics of the orbital frequency match the stellar oscillation
eigenfrequencies. As a star passes through these resonances, the associated
modes will be excited and can be driven to amplitudes that are so large that
there is a back reaction on the orbit which, in turn, limits the growth of the
modes. A formalism is presented for describing this dynamical interaction for a
non-rotating star in the linear approximation when the orbit can be treated as
non-relativistic. A semi-analytical expression is found for computing the
resonant energy transfer as a function of stellar and orbital parameters for
the regime where back reaction may be neglected. This is used to calculate the
results of passage through a sequence of resonances for several hypothetical
systems. It is found that the amplitude of the l=m=2 f-mode can be driven into
the non-linear regime for appropriate initial conditions. We also discuss where
the no back reaction approximation is expected to fail, and the qualitative

population age > 12 Gyr and is known for its kinematically decoupled core and
skew rotation at larger radii. We fit the two-dimensional mean velocity field
obtained by the SAURON integral-field spectrograph, and the isophotal
ellipticity and position-angle profiles, using the velocity field fitting
approach. We find NGC 4365 to be strongly triaxial (triaxiality parameter T
approximately 0.45) and somewhat flatter than it appears. Axisymmetry or near
axisymmetry (T < 0.1) is ruled out at > 95% confidence. In the most probable
orientation the long axis points roughly toward the observer, extending to the
southwest in projection. Strong triaxiality has persisted for hundreds of
dynamical times, ruling out black holes above 3 x 10^9 solar masses. The
M-sigma relation predicts 4 x 10^8 solar masses, which would not preclude
long-lived triaxiality and is consistent with the observations. NGC 4365 lends
support to a picture in which supermassive black holes, while omnipresent in

objects for which we have both a determination of Lacc from Halpha and a Pabeta

luminosity Lacc, found by Muzerolle et al. (1998) for T Tauri stars in Taurus,
extends to objects with mass approx 0.03 Msun; L(Pab) can be used to measure
Lacc also in the substellar regime. The results were less conclusive for
Brgamma, which was detected only in 2 objects, neither of which had an Halpha
estimate of Macc. Using the relation between L(Pab) and Lacc we determined the
accretion rate for all the objects in our sample (including those with no
Halpha spectrum), more than doubling the number of substellar objects with
known Macc. When plotted as a function of the mass of the central object
together with data from the literature, our results confirm the trend of lower
Macc for lower Mstar, although with a large spread. Some of the spread is
probably due to an age effect; our very young objects in rho-Oph have on
average an accretion rate at least one order of magnitude higher than objects
of similar mass in older regions. As a side product, we found that the width of
Halpha measured at 10% peak intensity is not only a qualitative indicator of
accretion, but can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate of Macc over a
large mass range, from T Tauri stars to brown dwarfs. Finally, we found that
some of our objects show evidence of mass-loss.

with an M2 to M5 main-sequence star at the distance of HD75289. No further

substellar companions with masses m > 0.050Msun from 400AU up to 2000AU.

Stromgren photometry is used in the frequency analysis, yielding two
frequencies with values of nu1=79.5 and nu2=71.3 c/d. The light curve with the
largest amplitude is that of the u band. This behaviour, which is not common
for delta Scuti stars, is explained as pulsation in a high radial order in
stars near the blue edge of the instability strip. The main period, with a
value of 18.12 min, represents the shortest period observed so far for a delta
Scuti-type pulsator. A seismic modelling, including instability predictions and
rotation effects, has been attempted. It is found that both main sequence and
pre-main sequence models predict modes in the range of 56 to 82 c/d (between
648 and 949 microHz), corresponding to oscillations of radial order n from 6 to
8. The highest of the observed frequencies only becomes unstable for models of

Ni are slightly overabundant ([X/Fe] ~ 0.05). The Na abundance among the giants
is more than 0.2 dex higher than in the dwarfs. We interpret this as due to
dredge-up of 23Na in the giants. Li abundances show a well-defined pattern: the
Solar-type stars have an almost constant Li abundance, just below that of the
Hyades, and the Li-dip is pronounced and well determined. Turnoff stars just
above the dip have a `cosmic' Li abundance, but within a very small range of
magnitudes (0.25 mag) higher on the turnoff, Li drops by more than a factor 10
implying that some extra mixing is required. Among the giants, two probable
clump stars show detectable Li, while all the other (likely) RGB stars do not.
We show that rotating stellar models including the most recent developments for
meridional circulation and turbulence by shear instabilities explain very well
the observed Li pattern. The possibility remains open that the giants
exhibiting the highest Li abundances are actual RGB bump stars which have just

the dust formation process and may even allow the dust formation in an

small scales is determined by the interaction of turbulent fluctuations.

abundances from the literature. As found in previous studies, the [alpha/Fe]
ratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally lower than similar
metallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample. Our kinematically selected
stars confirm that this is true for all major stellar components of the Galaxy,
including the halo, thin disk, and thick disk. There is marginal overlap in the
low [alpha/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on extreme
retrograde orbits, but this is not supported by other element ratios, like
[Ba/Y]. Thus, the full chemical signature of most of the dSph stars are
distinct from the main components of the Galaxy. This result rules out
continuous merging of low mass galaxies similar to these dSph satellites during
the formation of the Galaxy, which is discuss further. The new environments
offered by the dSph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions
related to nucleosynthesis. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -1.8) in the dSph
galaxies have [alpha/Fe] ratio that are consistent with predictions from the
alpha-process (alpha-rich freeze out). This may also explain the very low Y
abundances, and could suggest a separate r-process site for this light (first
peak r-process) element. In stars with higher metallicities ([Fe/H] > -1.8),
contributions from the s-process are expected; [Ba/Y] is still much higher in
the dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars though, consistent with
s-process contributions from only the low metallicity AGB stars in dSph
galaxies. Finally, the Na-Ni trend in Galactic halo stars is confirmed, but
discuss this in terms of nucleosynthesis, and not the accretion of dSphs.

approximation (LDA) and the general gradient approximation (GGA), we found that
the WDA significantly improves the equilibrium volume of these materials in
cubic symmetry over both the LDA and GGA; Ferroelectric instabilities
calculated by the WDA agree with the LDA and GGA very well; At the experimental
ferroelectric lattice, optimized atom positions by the WDA are in good
agreement with measured data; However the WDA overestimates the strain of
tetragonal PbTiO$_3$ at experimental volume; The WDA overestimates the volume
of fully relaxed structures, but the GGA results are even worse. Some
calculations were also done with other models for $G$. It is found that a $G$
with longer range behavior yields improved relaxed structures. Possible avenues
for improving the WDA are discussed.

essential in explaining the experimental data in which the single particle

  Under conditions that turn out to be closely related, a real surface that
possesses rotational symmetry can be equivariantly embedded in 3-dimensional
Euclidean space. The embedding does not obviously depend on a parameter.
However, the Gaussian curvature is given by a simple formula: If the metric is

$\K_g=-{1/2}\phi''(r)$.
  This note shows that metrics $g$ and $\hat{g}$ occur in dual pairs, and that
the embeddings described above are orthogonal facets of a single phenomenon. In
particular, the metrics and their respective embeddings differ by a Wick
rotation that preserves the ambient symmetry.
  Consequently, the embedding of $g$ depends on a real parameter. The ambient
space is not smooth, and $\kappa$ is inversely proportional to the cone angle
at the axis of rotation. Further, the Gaussian curvature of $\hat{g}$ is given

acceleration limits the accuracy of any test of gravity that relies on the
precise determination of the spacecraft trajectory. We describe a novel
two-step laser ranging technique, which largely eliminates the effects of
non-gravity acceleration sources and enables celestial mechanics checks with
unprecedented precision. A passive proof mass is released from the mother
spacecraft on a solar system exploration mission. Retro-reflectors attached to
the proof mass allow its relative position to the spacecraft to be determined
using optical ranging techniques. Meanwhile, the position of the spacecraft
relative to the Earth is determined by ranging with a laser transponder. The
vector sum of the two is the position, relative to the Earth, of the proof
mass, the measurement of which is not affected by the residual accelerations of
the mother spacecraft. We also describe the mission concept of the Dark Matter
Explorers (DMX), which will demonstrate this technology and will use it to test
the hypothesis that dark matter congregates around the sun. This hypothesis
implies a small apparent deviation from the inverse square law of gravity,
which can be detected by a sensitive experiment. We expect to achieve an
acceleration resolution of $\sim 10^{-14} m/s^2$. DMX will also be sensitive to
acceleration towards the galactic center, which has a value of $\sim 10^{-10}
m/s^2$. Since dark matter dominates the galactic acceleration, DMX can also
test whether dark matter obeys the equivalence principle to a level of 100 ppm
by ranging to several proof masses of different composition from the mother
spacecraft.

classical horizon spreading to {\it Quantum Horizon} . In terms of the
background metric of the black hole with the {\it Quantum Horizon}, a quantum
field theory in curved space without ultraviolet divergency near the horizon is
formulated. In this formulism, the black hole thermodynamics is reproduced
correctly without both ambiguity and additional hypothesis in the deriving the
hole's Hawking radiations and entropies, and a new interesting prediction on
the number of radiative field modes $N$ is provided. Specifically, the main
results are follows: 1, Hawking radiations rightly emerge as an effect of
quantum tunneling through the quantum horizon, and hence the ambiguities due to
going across the singularity on the classical horizon were got rid of; 2, 't
Hooft's brick wall thickness hypothesis and the boundary condition imposed for
the field considered in his brick wall model were got rid of also, and related
physics has been interpreted; 3, The present theory is parameter free. So, the
theory has power to predict the multiplicity $N$ of radiative field modes
according to the requirement of normalization of Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. It
has been found that $N\simeq 162$, which is just in good agreement with one in
the Minimal Super-symmetric Standard Model. The studies in this paper represent
an attempt to reveal some physics near the horizon at Planck scale. This paper

the general relativistic Maxwell equations both in the vicinity of the stellar
surface and far from it, once a perturbative velocity field is specified. In
this first paper we present general analytic expressions that are not
specialized to a particular magnetic field topology or velocity field. However,
as a validating example and an astrophysically important application, we
consider a dipolar magnetic field and the velocity field corresponding to the
rotation of the misaligned dipole. Besides providing analytic expressions for
the electromagnetic fields produced by this configuration, we calculate, for
the first time, the general relativistic energy loss through dipolar
electromagnetic radiation. We find that the widely used Newtonian expression
under-estimates this loss by a factor of 2-6 depending on the stellar
compactness. This correction could have important consequences in the study of
the spin evolution of pulsars.

SU(2)_H. This unification takes place at the scale M= O(1-2 TeV) and gives the
correct value of sin^2 theta_W(M_Z^2) without the violation of the upper bound
on the K_L -> mu e rate and the limits on FCNC processes. These properties
require the existence of three new generations of unconventional quarks and
leptons with charges up to 4/3 (for quarks) and 2 (for leptons) and masses
O(250 GeV) in addition to the standard three generations of quarks and leptons.
The horizontal group SU(2)_H connects the standard fermions with the
unconventional ones. We work out the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the
gauge group G_PUT down to the SM gauge group, generalize the existing one-loop
renormalization group (RG) analysis to the two-loop level including the
contributions of Higgs scalars and Yukawa couplings, and demonstrate that the
presence of three new generations of heavy unconventional quarks and leptons
with masses O(250 GeV) is consistent with astrophysical constraints. The NLO
and Higgs contributions to the RG analysis are significant while the Yukawa
contributions can be neglected.

occurs in a wide variety of unified models can carry zero modes of heavy
Majorana neutrinos. Decaying and/or repeatedly self-interacting closed loops of
these ``$B-L$'' cosmic strings can be a non-thermal source of heavy
right-handed Majorana neutrinos whose decay can contribute to the observed
baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) via the leptogenesis route. The $B-L$
cosmic strings are expected in GUT models such as SO(10), where they can be
formed at an intermediate stage of symmetry breaking well below the GUT scale
$\sim 10^{16}$ GeV; such light strings are not excluded by the CMB anisotropy
data and may well exist. We estimate the contribution of $B-L$ cosmic string
loops to the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe in the light of current
knowledge on neutrino masses and mixings implied by atmospheric and solar
neutrino measurements. We find that $B-L$ cosmic string loops can contribute
significantly to the BAU for $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking scale
$\eta_{B-L}\gsim 1.7\times 10^{11}\gev$. At the same time, in order for the
contribution of decaying $B-L$ cosmic string loops not to exceed the observed
baryon-to-photon ratio inferred from the recent WMAP results, the lightest
heavy right-handed Majorana neutrino mass $M_1$ must satisfy the constraint
$M_1 \leq 2.4 \times 10^{12}(\eta_{B-L}/10^{13}\gev)^{1/2}\gev$. This may have
interesting implications for the associated Yukawa couplings in the heavy

phase transition from the normal phase to the spontaneously broken one. In
particular, at the critical value of the combined evolution parameter the usual

developments of mathematics and physics. The role of geometric effects in the
Quantum Theory of particles and fields and spacetime has been an active topic
of research. This paper attempts to obtain the conditions for a Unified Gauge
Field Theory, including gravity. In the Yang Mills type of theories with
compactifications from a 10 or 11 dimensional space to a spacetime of 4
dimensions, the Kaluza Klein and the Holonomy approach has been used. In the
compactifications of Calabi Yau spaces and sub manifolds, the Euler number
Topological Index is used to label the allowed states and the transitions. With
a SU(2) or SL(2,C) connection for gravity and the U(1)*SU(2)*SU(3) or SU(5)
gauge connection for the other interactions, a Unified gauge field theory is
expressed in the 10 or 11 dimension space. Partition functions for the sum over
all possible configurations of sub spaces labeled by the Euler number index and
the Action for gauge and matter fields are constructed. Topological Euler
number changing transitions that can occur in the gauge fields and the
compactified spaces, and their significance are discussed. The possible limits
and effects of the physical validity of such a theory are discussed.

These mode structures are suggested from the form of the Lyapunov vectors

It is shown that the largest time-oscillating period of the Lyapunov modes is
twice as long as the time-oscillating period of the longitudinal momentum

particle number and boundary conditions. A simple explanation for this relation

rapidly changing as new high precision data become available. We present an
evaluation of existing data, detailing the treatment of systematic errors and
discrepancies, and show how they constrain the astrophysical S factor (S17),
independent of any nuclear structure model. With theoretical models robustly
determining the behavior of the sub-threshold pole, the extrapolation error can
be reduced and a constraint placed on the slope of S17. Using only radiative
capture data, we find S17(0) = 20.7 +/- 0.6 (stat) +/- 1.0 (syst) eV b if data
sets are completely independent, while if data sets are completely correlated
we find S17(0) = 21.4 +/- 0.5 (stat) +/- 1.4 (syst) eV b. The truth likely lies
somewhere in between these two limits. Although we employ a formalism capable
of treating discrepant data, we note that the central value of the S factor is
dominated by the recent high precision data of Junghans et al., which imply a
substantially higher value than other radiative capture and indirect
measurements. Therefore we conclude that further progress will require new high
precision data with a detailed error budget.
