decay at 100--600 seconds after the burst, the decay becoming slower after
about 10 minutes. We investigate two scenarios for the fast decaying early
optical emission of these GRB afterglows. In the reverse-forward shock
scenario, this emission arises in the reverse shock crossing the GRB ejecta,
the mitigation of the light-curve decay occurring when the forward shock
emission overtakes that from the reverse shock. Both a homogeneous and
wind-like circumburst medium are considered. In the wind-bubble scenario, the
steeply decaying, early optical emission arises from the forward shock
interacting with a 1/r^2 bubble, with a negligible contribution from the
reverse shock, the slower decay starting when the blast wave reaches the bubble
termination shock and enters a homogeneous region of the circumburst medium.
  We determine the shock microphysical parameters, ejecta kinetic energy, and
circumburst density which accommodate the radio and optical measurements of the
GRB afterglows 990123 and 021211. We find that, for a homogeneous medium, the
radio and optical emissions of the afterglow 990123 can be accommodated by the
reverse-forward shock scenario if the microphysical parameters behind the two
shocks differ substantially. A wind-like circumburst medium also allows the
reverse-forward shocks scenario to account for the radio and optical properties
of the afterglows 990123 and 021211, but the required wind densities are at
least 10 times smaller than those of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars. The wind-bubble
scenario requires a variation of the microphysical parameters when the
afterglow fireball reaches the wind termination shock, which seems a contrived
feature.

function of X-ray obscuration and optical classification in the Chandra Deep
Field South. The sample consists of the Chandra hard--band detections with hard

mid--infrared fluxes for the sample. Since obscured AGN locally have higher 24
micron / 2-8 keV ratios than unobscured AGN, and since X-ray background models
predict a large population of obscured AGN, we expect to find many X-ray--hard,
IR--bright AGN. Instead, we find that the 24 micron to X-ray flux ratio does
not depend on X-ray hardness in the full sample, nor does it differ between
narrow--line and broad--line AGN. We identify 5 nearly Compton--thick AGN, and
find they have similar 24 micron to X-ray flux ratios compared to the full

there is some evidence that the flux ratio increases with X-ray hardness. The
redshift slice also shows an odd trend, which is also prominent in the full

ratios.

The results were obtained by matching Spitzer sources at 24 and 70 microns with

redshifts have been obtained for over 500 matched IR/radio sources using

find that q_{24} shows significantly more dispersion than q_{70}. By comparing
the observed fluxes at 70, 24 and 4.5 microns with a library of SED templates,
we find that the larger dispersion in q_{24} is predictable in terms of
systematic variations in SED shape throughout the population. Although the
models are not able to encompass the full range of observed behavior (both the
presence of either extremely flat or extremely steep IR SEDs), the fitting
parameters were used to `k-correct' the higher-z galaxies which resulted in a
reduced scatter in q. For comparison, we also corrected these data using the
SED for M82. The results for 24 and 70 microns provide strong consistent
evidence for the universality of the mid-IR/radio and far-IR/radio correlations

2e-2 h^3/Mpc^3, roughly one order of magnitude larger than that of Lyman break

Msun, and their observed-frame G-R colors lie in the range 0.0<G-R<1.0. They
typically have been continuously forming stars with a rate exceeding 30 Msun/yr
over a few Gyrs from z=10 to z=2, although the TVD simulation indicates a more
sporadic star formation history than the SPH simulations. Of order half of
their stellar mass was already assembled by z~4. The reddest massive galaxies
at z=2 with G-R >= 1.0 and Mstar>1e10 Msun/h finished the build-up of their
stellar mass by z~3. Interestingly, our study suggests that the majority of the
most massive galaxies at z=2 should be detectable at rest-frame UV wavelengths,
contrary to some recent claims made on the basis of near-IR studies of galaxies
at the same epoch, provided the median extinction is less than E(B-V)<0.3.
However, our results also suggest that the fraction of stellar mass contained
in galaxies that pass the color-selection criteria could be as low as 50% of
the total stellar mass in the Universe at z=2. Our simulations suggest that the
missing stellar mass is contained in fainter (R>25.5) and intrinsically redder

circular velocity distribution function (VDF) for hosts of 10^11 to 10^14 Msun
at redshifts from zero to two or higher has a self-similar shape, is
independent of host halo mass and redshift, and follows the relation:
dn/dv=(1/8)(v_cmax/v_cmax,host)^-4. Halo to halo variance in the VDF is a
factor of roughly two to four. At high redshifts, we find preliminary evidence
for fewer large substructure haloes (subhaloes). Specific angular momenta are
significantly lower for subhaloes nearer the host halo centre where tidal
stripping is more effective. The radial distribution of subhaloes is marginally
consistent with the mass profile for r >~ 0.3r_vir, where the possibility of
artificial numerical disruption of subhaloes can be most reliably excluded by
our convergence study, although a subhalo distribution that is shallower than
the mass profile is favoured. Subhalo masses but not circular velocities
decrease toward the host centre. Subhalo velocity dispersions hint at a
positive velocity bias at small radii. There is a weak bias toward more
circular orbits at lower redshift, especially at small radii. We additionally
model a cluster in several power law cosmologies of P ~ k^n, and demonstrate
that a steeper spectral index, n, results in significantly less substructure.

evolution of the bolometric energy output from distant galaxy populations. We
present the results from deep 24 micron imaging from Spitzer surveys, which
include approximately 50,000 sources to an 80% completeness of 60 uJy. The 24
micron counts rapidly rise at near-Euclidean rates down to 5 mJy, increase with
a super-Euclidean rate between 0.4 - 4 mJy, and converge below 0.3 mJy. The 24
micron counts exceed expectations from non-evolving models by a factor >10 at
0.1 mJy. The peak in the differential number counts corresponds to a population
of faint sources that is not expected from predictions based on 15 micron
counts from ISO. We argue that this implies the existence of a previously
undetected population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z ~ 1-3. Integrating the
counts to 60 uJy, we derive a lower limit on the 24 micron background intensity
of 1.9 +/- 0.6 nW m-2 sr-1 of which the majority (~ 60%) stems from sources
fainter than 0.4 mJy. Extrapolating to fainter flux densities, sources below 60

2-point correlation function in real space is well approximated by a power law
with slope gamma=1.5 pm 0.2 and comoving correlation length
r_0=4.8^{+0.9}_{-1.5} h^{-1} Mpc. Splitting the sample into three subsets based
on redshift, we find evidence for an increase of the clustering amplitude with
lookback time. For a fixed gamma, evolution of r_0 is detected at the 3.6 sigma
confidence level. The ratio between the quasar correlation function and the
mass autocorrelation function (derived adopting the concordance cosmological
model) is found to be scale independent. For a linear mass-clustering amplitude
sigma_8=0.8, the ``bias parameter'' decreases from b~3.9$ at z_eff=1.89 to
b~1.8 at z_eff=1.06. From the observed abundance and clustering, we infer how
quasars populate dark-matter haloes of different masses. We find that 2QZ
quasars sit in haloes with M>10^{12} M_sun and that the mean mass of their host
haloes is of the order of 10^{13} M_sun. The observed clustering is consistent
with assuming that the locally observed correlation between black-hole mass and
host-galaxy circular velocity is still valid at z>1. From the fraction of
haloes which contain active quasars, we infer that the characteristic quasar
lifetime is t_Q ~ a few x 10^7 yr at z~1 and approaches 10^8 yr at higher

in the near-infrared and at 24 micron (K-[24] = 2.4 mag), probably due to

smaller excesses, K-[24] = 0.6-0.9. Among late-type stars, two show large
excesses: P922 - a K1V star with K-[24] = 1.08 pm 0.11 and P1121 - an F9V star

systems with stronger mid-infared (20-100 um) excesses relative to their
near-infrared (1-5 um) excess display significantly more PAH emission than
those with weaker mid-infrared excesses. This provides strong observational
support for the disk models by Dullemond (2002), in which systems with a
flaring disk geometry display a strong mid-infrared excess, whereas those with
disks that are strongly shadowed by the puffed-up inner rim of the disk only
display modest amounts of mid-infrared emission. The PAH emission is expected
to be produced mainly in the part of the disk atmosphere that is directly
exposed to radiation from the central star. In this model, self-shadowed disks
should display weaker PAH emission than flared disks, consistent with our

diameters as well as the high-resolution spectra of alf Ori and alf Her
obtained in the 11 micron region can be reproduced by a warm water vapor
envelope, whose presence in alf Ori was revealed by Tsuji (2000) based on the
reanalysis of the near-infrared data obtained with the Stratoscope II. While
prominent absorption due to H2O can be expected from such a dense, warm water
vapor envelope, the absorption lines can be filled in by emission from the
extended part of the envelope. This effect leads to a significant weakening of
the H2O lines in the 11 micron region, and makes the observed spectra appear to
be rather featureless and continuum-like. However, the emission due to H2O
lines from the extended envelope leads to an increase of the apparent size in
this spectral region. The observed angular diameter and the high resolution
spectra of alf Ori and alf Her in the 11 micron region can be best interpreted

powers of these sources are estimated by using a previously known correlation
between X-ray luminosity and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. Thirty-one of our
candidates have high estimated powers (Lx > 10^44 erg/s) and therefore qualify
as optically obscured quasars, the so-called ``QSO 2''. Based on the derived
X-ray powers, our candidates are likely to be at relatively high redshifts, z ~
3, with the QSO 2 at z ~ 4. By going ~ 3 magnitudes fainter than previously
known type 2 AGN in the two GOODS fields we are sampling a region of redshift -
power space which was previously unreachable with classical methods. Our method
brings to 40 the number of QSO 2 in the GOODS fields, an improvement of a
factor ~ 4 when compared to the only 9 such sources previously known. We derive
a QSO 2 surface density down to 10^-15 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5 - 8 keV band of >~
330/deg^2, ~ 30% of which is made up of previously known sources. This is
larger than current estimates and some predictions and suggests that the
surface density of QSO 2 at faint flux limits has been underestimated. This
work demonstrates that VO tools are mature enough to produce cutting-edge
science results by exploiting astronomical data beyond ``classical''

neglect environment, grossly overestimate the ellipticity of the lens galaxy
(de/e~0.5) and the Hubble constant (dh/h~0.22). Standard models of quad lenses,
which approximate the environment as a tidal shear, recover the ellipticity
reasonably well (|de/e|<~0.24) but overestimate the Hubble constant
(dh/h~0.15), and have significant (~30%) errors in the millilensing analyses
used to constrain the amount of substructure in dark matter halos. For both
doubles and quads, standard models slightly overestimate the velocity
dispersion of the lens galaxy (d(sigma)/sigma~0.06), and underestimate the
magnifications of the images (d(mu)/mu ~ -0.25). Standard analyses of lens
statistics overestimate Omega_Lambda (by 0.05-0.14), and underestimate the
ratio of quads to doubles (by a factor of 2). These biases help explain some
long-standing puzzles (such as the high observed quad/double ratio), but
aggravate others (such as the low value of H_0 inferred from lensing). Most of
the biases are caused by neglect of the convergence from the mass associated
with the environment, but additional uncertainty is introduced by neglect of
higher-order terms. Fortunately, we show that directly observing and modeling
lens environments should make it possible to remove the biases and reduce the
uncertainties associated with environments to the few percent level. (Abridged)

the radio jet axis but more closely aligned to the distribution of the nuclear
H2O maser spots. S1 is detected at 5 GHz but not at 1.4 GHz, indicating strong
free-free absorption below 5 GHz, and it has a flat spectrum between 5 GHz and
8.4 GHz. A 5/8.4 GHz spectral index map reveals an unresolved, inverted
spectrum source at the center of the S1 structure which may mark the AGN
proper. The average brightness temperature is too low for synchrotron
self-absorption to impact the integrated spectrum significantly. In addition, a
careful registration with the nuclear H2O masers argues that the S1 continuum
source arises from the inner regions of the maser disk rather than a radio jet.

mediation of a Bogoliubov collective excitation traveling throughout the
condensate. Furthermore, as long as the Bose gas is stable, no collision
happens between condensed and normal atoms. In this paper, we show how the
kinetic theory in the GRPA allows to calculate the dynamic structure factor at
finite temperature and when the normal and superfluid are in a relative motion.
The obtained spectrum for this factor provides a prediction which, compared to

Geometrical frustration in the pyrochlore lattice structure of V cations
suppresses development of spin and orbital correlations, however, we find that
the model exhibits two transitions at low temperatures. First, a discontinuous
transition occurs with an orbital ordering assisted by the tetragonal
Jahn-Teller distortion. The orbital order reduces the frustration in spin
exchange interactions, and induces antiferromagnetic correlations in
one-dimensional chains lying in the perpendicular planes to the tetragonal
distortion. Secondly, at a lower temperature, a three-dimensional
antiferromagnetic order sets in continuously, which is stabilized by the
third-neighbor interaction among the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic chains.
Thermal fluctuations are crucial to stabilize the collinear magnetic state by
the order-by-disorder mechanism. The results well reproduce the experimental
data such as transition temperatures, temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility, changes of the entropy at the transitions, and the magnetic
ordering structure at low temperatures. Quantum fluctuation effect is also
examined by the linear spin wave theory at zero temperature. The staggered
moment in the ground state is found to be considerably reduced from saturated
value, and reasonably agrees with the experimental data.

twisted boundary conditions (BC) instead of standard periodic BC. For static
and dynamical correlation functions, averaging procedure over the twisted BC is
used to reduce the finite-size effect. We find that antiferromagnetic spin
correlation remains strong in electron doping in contrast to the case of hole
doping, being similar to the case of the periodic BC. This leads to a
remarkable electron-hole asymmetry in the dynamical spin structure factor and
two-magnon Raman scattering. By changing the twist, the single-particle
spectral function is obtained for all momenta in the Brillouin zone. Examining
the spectral function in detail, we find a gap opening at around the k=(pi,0)
region for 10% doping of holes (the carrier concentration x=0.1), leading to a
Fermi arc that is consistent with experiments. In electron doping, however, a
gap opens at around k=(pi/2,pi/2) and persists up to x=0.2, being correlated
with the strength of the antiferromagnetic correlation. We find that the
magnitude of the gaps is sensitive to t' and t''. A pseudogap is also seen in
the optical conductivity for electron doping, and its magnitude is found to be
the same as that in the spectral function. We compare calculated quantities

heavily boron-doped diamond synthesized by high pressure sintering was received
with considerable surprise. Opening up new possibilities for diamond-based
electrical devices, a systematic investigation of these phenomena clearly needs
to be achieved. Here we show unambiguous evidence of superconductivity in a
diamond thin film deposited by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.
Furthermore the onset of the superconducting transition is found to be 7.4K,

property of boron-doped diamond, demonstrating that device application is

occurs at small length scales because conformational fluctuations overcome
electrostatic repulsion. The electrostatic persistence length depends on the
square of the screening length, $\ell_e\sim\kappa^{-2}$, as first argued by
Khokhlov and Khachaturian by applying the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman (OSF) theory to
a string of crumpled blobs. We compare our approach to previous theoretical
works (including variational formulations) and show that the result
$\ell_e\sim\kappa^{-1}$ found by several authors comes from the improper use of
a cutoff at small length scales. For highly charged and stiff chains, crumpling
does not occur; here we recover the OSF result and validate the perturbative
calculation for slightly bent rods.

violation in $B\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $S$, with the precision observable $\sin 2\beta$
obtained from the CP asymmetry in $B\to\psi K_S$. It is then possible to write
down exact analytical expressions for $\bar\rho$ and $\bar\eta$ as simple
functions of the observables $S$ and $\sin 2\beta$, and of the penguin
parameters $r$ and $\phi$. As an application clean lower bounds on $\bar\eta$
and $1-\bar\rho$ can be derived as functions of $S$ and $\sin 2\beta$,
essentially without hadronic uncertainty. Computing $r$ and $\phi$ within QCD
factorization yields precise determinations of $\bar\rho$ and $\bar\eta$ since
the dependence on $r$ and $\phi$ is rather weak. It is emphasized that the
sensitivity to the phase $\phi$ enters only at second order and is extremely
small for moderate values of this phase, predicted in the heavy-quark limit.
Transparent analytical formulas are further given and discussed for the
parameter $C$ of direct CP violation in $B\to\pi^+\pi^-$. We also discuss
alternative ways to analyze $S$ and $C$ that can be useful if new physics
affects $B_d$--$\bar B_d$ mixing. Predictions and uncertainties for $r$ and
$\phi$ in QCD factorization are examined in detail. It is pointed out that a
simultaneous expansion in $1/m_b$ and 1/N leads to interesting simplifications.
At first order infrared divergences are absent, while the most important
effects are retained. Independent experimental tests of the factorization

one possible CP violating angle. They argue that the sign of the baryon

asymmetries possibly observable in accelerator experiments. Unfortunately,
there is a fly in the ointment. It was later shown by Raidal and Strumia [RS]

abuse of language,""generalized supertranslations"") is provided. In each given
space-time the maximal, saturated, generalized supersymmetry, compatible with
the division-algebra constraint that can be consistently imposed on spinors and
on superalgebra generators, is furnished. Constraining the superalgebra
generators in both the complex and the quaternionic cases gives rise to the two
classes of constrained hermitian and holomorphic generalized supersymmetries.
In the complex case these two classes of generalized supersymmetries can be
regarded as complementary. The quaternionic holomorphic supersymmetry only
exists in certain space-time dimensions and can admit at most a single bosonic
scalar central charge.
  The results here presented pave the way for a better understanding of the
various $M$ algebra-type of structures which can be introduced in different
space-time signatures and in association with different division algebras, as
well as their mutual relations. In a previous work, e.g., the introduction of a
complex holomorphic generalized supersymmetry was shown to be necessary in
order to perform the analytic continuation of the standard $M$-theory to the
11-dimensional Euclidean space. As an application of the present results, it is
shown that the above algebra also admits a 12-dimensional, Euclidean,

representation of $A_n$ is ``regular'' if the absolutely continuous part
coincides with the type L part. All known examples are regular. Absolutely
continuous functionals are intimately related to maps which intertwine a given
$*$-extendible representation with the left regular representation. A simple
application of these ideas extends reflexivity and hyper-reflexivity results.
Moreover the use of absolute continuity is a crucial device for establishing a
density theorem which states that the unit ball of $\sigma(A_n)$ is weak-$*$
dense in the unit ball of the associated free semigroup algebra if and only if
$\sigma$ is regular. We provide some explicit constructions related to the

postulate three laws which form a mathematical framework to describe artificial
life evolutionary dynamics. They are based on a continuous approximation of
population dynamics. Four dynamical elements are required in this formulation:
ascendant matrix, transverse matrix, fitness function, and the stochastic
drive. The first law states that in the absence of stochastic drive the
artificial life always seeks for a local fitness attractor and stay there. It
gives the reference point to discuss the general evolutionary dynamics. The
second law is explicitly expressed in a unique form of stochastic differential
equation with all four dynamical elements. The third law defines the
relationship between the focused level of description to its lower and higher
ones, and also defines the dichotomy of deterministic and stochastic drives.
These laws provide a coherence framework to discuss several current problems,
such as emergency and stability. In particular, two quantities are emphasized:
the fitness function as the standard for selection and the stochasticity as the
source of creativity. Those three laws may appear almost self-evident from a
statistical physics point of view. However, their equivalent to a most
conventional approach for evolutionary dynamics is shown for the first time by
the present author, to the best of his knowledge. The computational advantage
of the present formulation in the study of artificial life evolution is also
discussed.

that rebinding, even with the addition of soluble heparin in the dissociation
phase, does not exhibit the expected exponential decay characteristic of a 1:1

and, within a self-consistent mean-field approximation, we derive the complete
mathematical form for the fraction of bound ligand as a function of time. We
show that, except for very low surface coverage/association rate, this function
is non-exponential at all times, indicating that multiple rebinding events
strongly influence dissociation even at early times. We compare the mean-field
results with numerical simulations and find good agreement, although deviations
are measurable in certain cases. Our analysis of the IGF-I-IGFBP-3 data
indicates that rebinding is prominent for this system and that the theoretical

analyzing SPR biosensor data where rebinding is problematic and a methodology

affording a clear separation between kinematical and dynamical quantum effects,
the Wigner distribution is particularly valuable in this regard. Here we
discuss some consequences of the fact that when closed-system classical and
quantum dynamics are treated in Gaussian approximation, they are in fact
identical. Thus, it follows that several results in the so-called `semiquantum'
chaos actually arise from approximating the classical, and not the quantum
dynamics. (Similarly, opposing claims of quantum suppression of chaos are also
suspect.) As a simple byproduct of the analysis we are able to show how the
Lyapunov exponent appears in the language of phase space distributions in a way

situations. We also informally discuss some aspects of approximations that go
