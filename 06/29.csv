a dynamical system in phase-space using a continuous set of local basis
functions. In practice, the method decomposes the density in phase-space into
small smooth units having compact support. We call these small units ``clouds''
and choose them to be Gaussians of elliptical support. Fortunately, the
evolution of these clouds in the local potential has an analytical solution,
that can be used to evolve the whole system during a significant fraction of
dynamical time. In the process, the clouds, initially round, change shape and
get elongated. At some point, the system needs to be remapped on round clouds
once again. This remapping can be performed optimally using a small number of
Lucy iterations. The remapped solution can be evolved again with the cloud
method, and the process can be iterated a large number of times without showing
significant diffusion. Our numerical experiments show that it is possible to
follow the 2 dimensional phase space distribution during a large number of
dynamical times with excellent accuracy. The main limitation to this accuracy
is the finite size of the clouds, which results in coarse graining the
structures smaller than the clouds and induces small aliasing effects at these
scales. However, it is shown in this paper that this method is consistent with
an adaptive refinement algorithm which allows one to track the evolution of the
finer structure in phase space. It is also shown that the generalization of the
cloud method to the 4 dimensional and the 6 dimensional phase space is quite
natural.

travel upwards, they get partially converted to longitudinal waves through
nonlinear effects (mode coupling). By solving the nonlinear, time-dependent MHD
equations we find that significant longitudinal wave generation occurs in the
photosphere typically for Mach numbers as low as 0.2 and that the onset of
shock formation occurs at heights of about 600 km above the photospheric base.
We also investigate the compressional heating due to longitudinal waves and the
efficiency of mode coupling for various values of the plasma $\beta$, that
parameterises the magnetic field strength in the network. We find that this
efficiency is maximum for field strengths corresponding to $\beta\approx 0.2$,
when the kink and tube wave speeds are almost identical. This can have
interesting observational implications. Furthermore, we find that even when the
two speeds are different, once shock formation occurs, the longitudinal and
transverse shocks exhibit strong mode coupling.

detected that suggested initially the presence of a large planet or brown dwarf
in orbit. However, further analysis revealed spectral line asymmetries that
change in phase with the 1.95-day period, casting doubt on those measurements.
These asymmetries make it more likely that the transit-like events in the light
curve are the result of contamination from the light of an eclipsing binary
along the same line of sight (referred to as a ""blend""). We performed detailed
simulations in which we generated synthetic light curves resulting from such
blend scenarios and fitted them to the measured light curve. Guided by these
fits and the inferred properties of the stars, we uncovered a second set of
lines in our spectra that correspond to the primary of the eclipsing binary and
explain the asymmetries. Using all the constraints from spectroscopy we were
then able to construct a model that satisfies all the observations, and to
characterize the three stars based on model isochrones. OGLE-TR-33 is fully
consistent with being a hierarchical triple system composed of a slightly
evolved F6 star (the brighter object) near the end of its main-sequence phase,
and an eclipsing binary with a K7-M0 star orbiting an F4 star. The application
to OGLE-TR-33 of the formalism developed to fit light curves of transit
candidates illustrates the power of such simulations for predicting additional
properties of the blend and for guiding further observations that may serve to
confirm that scenario, thereby ruling out a planet. Tests such as this can be
very important for validating faint candidates.

a type of neutron stars which accrete a cloud of dirty hydrogen (accretors).
Although they are very small (some hundreds of kilometres), the accretors
should be easily observable because the accretion raises the surface
temperature over 1 000 000 K, but they are never detected. The reason of this
failure is a misunderstanding of the spectroscopy of hydrogen crossed by a
powerful beam of short wavelengths light. Except very close to the surface,
hydrogen is mostly heated by a Lyman absorption improved by a parametric
frequency shift due to excited atomic hydrogen, so that this absorption
stabilises the temperature between the limits of ionisation and dimerisation. A
powerful radio emission may produce an extra ionisation where the pressure is
convenient. The combination of Lyman absorptions and redshifts produces an
instability which chains Lyman absorption patterns : when a redshifted Lyman
absorbed line coincides with a Lyman line, all absorption lines of the gas are
written into the spectrum. Thus all characteristics of the complex spectrum of
a quasar are generated, so that observed accretors are named quasars, and the
origin of the intrinsic redshifts is found. The lack of redshifts of the
variations of luminosity of stars and quasars shows that the ""cosmological
redshifts"" result from the parametric frequency shift, so that the universe
does not expand.

of the gas within a ``cooling radius'' cools and contracts monolithically to
fuel galaxy formation. Here we take into account the expectation that the hot
gas in galactic halos is thermally unstable and prone to fragmentation during
cooling and show that the implications are more far-reaching than previously
expected: allowing multi-phase cooling fundamentally alters expectations about
gas infall in halos and naturally explains the bright-end cutoff in the galaxy
luminosity function. We argue that cooling should proceed via the formation of
high-density, 10^4 K clouds, pressure-confined within a hot gas background. The
background medium has a low density, and can survive as a stable corona with a
long cooling time. The fraction of baryons contained in the residual hot core
grows with halo mass because the cooling density increases, and this leads to
an upper-mass limit in quiescent, non-merged galaxies of ~10^11 Msun. In this
scenario, galaxy formation is fueled by the infall of pressure-supported
clouds. For Milky-Way-size systems, clouds of mass ~ 5x10^6 Msun that formed or
merged within the last several Gyrs should still exist as a residual population
in the halo, with a total mass in clouds of ~ 2 x 10^10 Msun. The mass of the
Milky Way galaxy is explained naturally in this model, and is a factor of two
smaller than would result in the standard treatment without feedback. We expect
clouds in galactic halos to be ~ 1 kpc in size and to extend ~150 kpc from
galactic centers. The predicted properties of clouds match well the observed
radial velocities, angular sizes, column densities, and velocity widths of High
Velocity Clouds around our Galaxy. The clouds also explain high-ion absorption
systems at z<1.

that the local density around bright red galaxies is a strong increasing
function of luminosity, but does not depend much on color at fixed luminosity.
Moreover, we show that this is due to central galaxies in dark matter halos
whose baryonic masses correlate strongly with halo mass. The simulation also
predicts that the local density around blue galaxies is a strong increasing
function of color, but does not depend much on luminosity at fixed color. We
show that this is due to satellite galaxies in halos whose stellar ages
correlate with halo mass. Finally, the simulation fails to predict the
luminosity dependence of environment observed around low luminosity red
galaxies. However, we show that this is most likely due to the simulation's
limited resolution. A study of a higher resolution, smaller volume simulation
suggests that this dependence is caused by the fact that all low luminosity red
galaxies are satellites in massive halos, whereas intermediate luminosity red
galaxies are a mixture of satellites in massive halos and central galaxies in
less massive halos.

of the projected semi-major axis of the orbit $\dot x=1.8(6)\times 10^{-14}$

the system. With this measurement we can constrain the orbital inclination
angle to $i<61\degr$, with a median likelihood value of $46\degr$ which is
consistent with results from polarimetric studies of the pulsar magnetosphere.

certain combinations of the companion mass, $m_2$, and the inclination, $i$.

mass in submillimetre objects is ~ 50 Msun compared with ~ 2000 Msun in
observed cloud mass estimated from the extinction. The submillimetre objects
represent only 2.5% of the cloud mass. A clear association is seen between the
locations of detected submillimetre objects and high visual extinction, with no
objects detected at A_V<7 magnitudes. Using the extinction map, we estimate
pressures within the cloud from P/k ~2x10^5 cm^-3 K in the less-extincted
regions to P/k ~2x10^6 cm^-3 K at the cloud centre. Given our sensitivities,
cold (T_d ~15K) clumps supported by thermal pressure, had they existed, should
have been detected throughout the majority of the map. Such objects may not be
present at low A_V because they may form only where A_V > 15, by some mechanism
(e.g., loss of non-thermal support).

obtained via the Ionization Correction Factors (ICFs) method, when available.
Chemical abundance relationships have been investigated; in particular, a
correlation between N/H and N/O similar to the Galactic one (Henry 1989), and a
feeble anti-correlation between O/H and N/O have been found.
  A gradient in O/H across the disc of M~33 is indicatively consistent with the
one found from HII regions in this galaxy (Vilchez et al 1988). Further studies
in the more external parts of M~33 are however needed to ascertain this point.
The present result shows that oxygen and helium abundances (with lower accuracy
also nitrogen, argon and sulphur) can be actually estimated from the brightest
PNe of a galaxy, even if the electron temperature cannot be measured. We also
found that the oxygen abundance is quite independent of the absolute magnitude
of the PN and consequently the brightest PNe are representative of the whole PN
population. This represents an important tool to measure the metallicity of
galaxies at the time of the formation of PNe progenitors.

photoionization and heating by X-rays on discs around low-mass stars. In
particular we address the question of whether or not X-rays can drive a disc
wind. First, we construct a 1-dimensional ``quasi-hydrostatic'' model, which
solves for the vertical structure introduced by X-ray heating. We consider
uniform X-ray illumination of the disc, but the X-ray fluxes required to heat
the disc significantly are much greater than those seen by recent observations.
When the model is extended to consider heating from a central X-ray source we
find that the 1-dimensional model is only valid very close to the star. We
extend our analysis to consider a simple 2-dimensional model, treating the disc
as a two-layered structure and solving for its density profile
self-consistently. For T Tauri stars we are able to set a crude upper limit on
the mass-loss rate that can be driven by X-ray photoevaporation, with a value
of ~10^-13 g/cm^2/s. Our model is designed to maximise this value, and most
likely over-estimates it significantly. However we still find a mass-loss rate
which is less than that found in studies of ultraviolet photoevaporation. We
conclude that in the presence of a significant UV field, X-ray driven disc
winds are unlikely to play a significant role in the evolution of discs around
low-mass stars.

explained in terms of the dense and compact component of a bipolar outflow.
This interpretation is confirmed by SiO and CO observations of the full region.

concentration with a radius of r~5'' (390 pc), which is resolved into double
peaks, and (2) spiral arms which extend out from the nuclear region. The
nuclear component has a mass of 1.3x10^8 Mo, which corresponds to ~3.5% of the
dynamical mass, and shows a slight non-circular motion. The double peaks are
separated by ~4''.7. (370 pc), and located on the root of optical spiral arms
in a HST image. The gas arms are associated with the spiral dust lanes, and are
linked to the central double peaks. The non-circular motions along the
molecular arms indicate the fact that the gas is driven by the density wave,
rather than the stochastic processes. We calculated the gas cloud orbits in a
stellar spiral potential, and explained the observed CO spiral arms and
non-circular motions. We suggest that the central gas condensation arises from
spiral-driven gas transfer. We estimated and compared the effect of two
possible mechanisms of angular-momentum transfer: galactic shock, and
gravitational torques. We discuss that the galactic shock is dominant.

to show and another 5 ones tentatively show the 53.3um absorption while another
7 sources highly probably do not show this line. The source class is found to
be correlated with the type of spectral profile: red supergiants (RSGs) and AGB
stars tend to show strong blue-shifted filling emission in their 53.3um
absorption line profiles while HII regions tend to show a weak red-shifted
filling emission in the line profile. GC sources and megamasers do not show
filling emission feature. It is argued that the filling emission might be the
manifestation of an unresolved half emission half absorption profile of the
53.3um doublet. The 53.3 to 34.6um equivalent width (EW) ratio is close to
unity for RSGs but much larger than unity for GC sources and megamasers while H
II regions only show the 53.3um line. The pump rate defined as maser to IR
photon flux ratio is approximately 5% for RSGs. The pump rates of GC sources
are three order of magnitude smaller. Both the large 53.3 to 34.6um EW ratio
and the small pump rate of the GC OH masers reflect that the two detected
`pumping lines' in these sources are actually of interstellar origin. The pump
rate of Arp 220 is 32%--much larger than that of RSGs, which indicates that the
contribution of other pumping mechanisms to this megamaser is important.

are explained by a single phase of unsaturated clumpy gas distributed in a thin
ring structure and amplifying background continuum. We emphasize the importance
of clumpiness in the OH masing medium, an effect that has not been fully
appreciated previously.
  The model explains why multiple bright spots are seen only at the ring
tangents while smoother emission is found elsewhere. Both the observed velocity
gradients and the line to continuum ratios around the ring enquire a geometry
where most of the seed photons come from a continuum emission which lies
outside the OH ring. To explain both the OH and continuum brightness, free-free
absorbing gas is required along the ring axis to partially absorb the far side
of the ring. It is proposed that the required geometry arises from an inwardly

the pairing of Sn with the vacancy produces a complex with the Sn-atom at the

sites. Within the framework of density-functional theory we use two
complementary ab initio methods, the pseudopotential plane wave (PPW) method
and the all-electron Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker (KKR) method, to investigate the
structure of vacancy complexes with 11 different sp-impurities. For the case of
Sn in Si, we confirm the split configuration and obtain good agreement with EPR
data of Watkins. In general we find that all impurities of the 5sp and 6sp
series in Si and Ge prefer the split-vacancy configuration, with an energy gain
of 0.5 to 1 eV compared to the substitutional complex. On the other hand,
impurities of the 3sp and 4sp series form a (slightly distorted) substitutional
complex. Al impurities show an exception from this rule, forming a split
complex in Si and a strongly distorted substitutional complex in Ge. We find a
strong correlation of these data with the size of the isolated impurities,
being defined via the lattice relaxations of the nearest neighbors.

through ""quakes"", some system variable undergoes record statistics with
accompanying log-Poisson statistics for the quake event times[4]. We

negative word of mouth to their neighbors, and so their neighborhood becomes
less susceptible to the product. The result is a dramatic increase in the
percolation threshold. When the effect of negative word of mouth is strong
enough, it is shown to block any product from spreading to a significant
fraction of the network. So, rather then being rejected by a large fraction of
the agents, the product gets blocked by the rejection of a negligible fraction
of the potential market. The rest of the potential buyers do not adopt the
product because they are never exposed to it: the negative word of mouth spread
by initial rejectors suffocates the diffusion by negatively affecting the
immediate neighborhood of the propagation front.

indicated a ``quantized Hall insulator'' (QHI) behavior: while the longitudinal
resistivity diverges with decreasing temperature and current bias, the Hall
resistivity remains quantized at the value $k h/ e^2$. We review the
experimental results and the theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon. In
particular, we discuss a theoretical approach which employs a model of the
insulator as a random network of weakly coupled puddles of QH liquid at fixed
filling factor. This model is proved to exhibit a robust quantization of the
Hall resistivity, provided the electron transport on the network is INCOHERENT.
Subsequent theoretical studies have focused on the controversy whether the
assumption of incoherence is necessary. The emergent conclusion is that in the
quantum coherent transport regime, quantum interference destroys the QHI as a
consequence of localization. Once the localization length becomes much shorter
than the dephasing length, the Hall resistivity diverges. We conclude by
mentioning some recent experimental observations and open questions.

spaces complemented with hard core constraints. The ground state at exactly
half filling is an insulating (Mott) singlet, and according to our analysis a
non-Fermi liquid order parameter $ \Delta $ usually associated with extended
s-wave superconductivity, will appear self-consistently as soon as a finite
density $ n $ holes are introduced. The non-Fermi liquid behavior is a
consequence of the nonlinear nature of the unitary transformation mapping the

supplementing the perturbative QCD factorized formalism with radiative parton
energy loss. We find that the nuclear modification factor which quantifies the
degree of suppression, is almost pT-independent both for RHIC (in agreement
with data) and for the LHC. This is a consequence of the shape of the partonic
pT-spectrum in elementary collisions which implies that for the same value of
the nuclear modification factor at higher pT, an increasingly smaller fraction
of parton energy loss is needed. When the values of the time-averaged transport
coefficient exceed 5 GeV^2/fm, the nuclear modification factor gradually loses
its sensitivity to the corresponding produced energy density. This is due to
particle production in the outer corona of the medium, which remains almost
unsuppressed even for extreme densities. Thus, even for the highest
experimentally accessible transverse momentum at the LHC and in contrast to
jets, the measurement of leading partons via leading hadrons is not a
penetrating probe of the dense matter, but a rather fragile probe which
fragments for the opacities reached below the skin of the medium. Relating the
transport coefficient to the energy density produced in the collision region,
we find and discuss a phenomenon reminiscent of the opacity problem of elliptic
flow: namely, the interaction of the hard parent parton with the medium appears
to be much stronger than that expected for perturbative interactions of the
hard parton with an ideal quark gluon plasma.

gauge and fermion couplings of Higgs bosons. We show that very mild theoretical
assumptions, which are valid in general multi-Higgs doublet models, are
sufficient to allow the extraction of absolute values for the couplings rather
than just ratios of the couplings. For Higgs masses below 200 GeV we find
accuracies of 10-40% for the Higgs boson couplings and total width after
several years of LHC running. Slightly stronger assumptions on the Higgs gauge
couplings even lead to a determination of couplings to fermions at the level of
10-20%. We also study the sensitivity to deviations from SM predictions in
several supersymmetric benchmark scenarios as a subset of the analysis.

quantum field theory can be determined by finding the eigenvalues and
eigensolutions of its light-cone Hamiltonian. One of the challenges in
obtaining nonperturbative solutions for gauge theories such as QCD using
light-cone Hamiltonian methods is to renormalize the theory while preserving
Lorentz symmetries and gauge invariance. For example, the truncation of the
light-cone Fock space leads to uncompensated ultraviolet divergences. We
present two methods for consistently regularizing light-cone-quantized gauge
theories in Feynman and light-cone gauges: (1) the introduction of a spectrum
of Pauli-Villars fields which produces a finite theory while preserving Lorentz
invariance; (2) the augmentation of the gauge-theory Lagrangian with higher
derivatives. In the latter case, which is applicable to light-cone gauge (A^+ =
0), the A^- component of the gauge field is maintained as an independent degree
of freedom rather than a constraint. Finite-mass Pauli-Villars regulators can
also be used to compensate for neglected higher Fock states. As a test case, we
apply these regularization procedures to an approximate nonperturbative
computation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in QED as a first
attempt to meet Feynman's famous challenge.

certain large charge states from a closed su(2) subsector. The ansatz differs
from the recently proposed all-loop gauge theory asymptotic Bethe ansatz by
additional factorized scattering terms for the local excitations. We also show
that our ansatz quantitatively reproduces everything that is currently known
about the string spectrum of these states. Firstly, by construction, we recover
the integral Bethe equations describing semiclassical spinning strings.
Secondly, we explain how to derive the 1/J energy corrections of arbitrary
M-impurity BMN states, provide explicit, general formulae for both distinct and
confluent mode numbers, and compare to asymptotic gauge theory. In the special
cases M=2,3 we reproduce the results of direct quantization of Callan et al.
Lastly, at large string tension and relatively small charge we recover the
famous 2 (n^2 lambda)^(1/4) asymptotics of massive string modes at level n.
Remarkably, this behavior is entirely determined by the novel scattering terms.
This is qualitatively consistent with the conjecture that these terms occur due
to wrapping effects in gauge theory. Our finding does not in itself cure the
disagreements between gauge and string theory, but leads us to speculate about
the structure of an interpolating Bethe ansatz for the AdS/CFT system at finite
coupling and charge.

using optimal realistic clocks. In particular we observe that the rate is rapid
enough to eliminate the black hole information puzzle: all information is lost
through the fundamental decoherence before the black hole can evaporate. This
improves on a previous calculation we presented with a sub-optimal clock in

both indicate the existence of weakly persistent long range time correlations
for the whole scaling range and time span hereby studied. Such correlations are
similar to Brownian fluctuations. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived and
Kramers-Moyal coefficients estimated from the data. They are interpreted in
terms of a drift and a diffusion coefficient as in fluid mechanics. All partial
distribution functions of the NAO monthly index fluctuations have a form close
to a Gaussian, for all time lags, in agreement with the findings of the scaling
analyses. This indicates the lack of predictive power of the present NAO
monthly index. Yet there are some deviations for large (and thus rare) events.
Whence suggestions for other measurements are made if some improved
predictability of the weather/climate in the North Atlantic is of interest. The
subsequent Langevin equation of the NAO signal fluctuations is explicitly
written in terms of the diffusion and drift parameters, and a characteristic
time scale for these is given in appendix.

  Interstimulus Interval Dependence in Apparent Motion","5 pages, 1 table","Physica A, 260 (Nos. 3-4), 555 (1998)",,,"q-bio.NC",,"  In a recent paper on Cortical Dynamics, Francis and Grossberg raise the
question how visual forms and motion information are integrated to generate a
coherent percept of moving forms? In their investigation of illusory contours
(which are, like Kanizsa squares, mental constructs rather than stimuli on the
retina) they quantify the subjective impression of apparent motion between
illusory contours that are formed by two subsequent stimuli with delay times of
about 0.2 second (called the interstimulus interval ISI). The impression of
apparent motion is due to a back referral of a later experience to an earlier
time in the conscious representation. A model is developed which describes the
state of awareness in the observer in terms of a time dependent Schroedinger
equation to which a second order time derivative is added. This addition
requires as boundary conditions the values of the solution both at the
beginning and after the process. Satisfactory quantitative agreement is found
between the results of the model and the experimental results. We recall that
in the von Neumann interpretation of the collapse of the quantum mechanical
wave-function, the collapse was associated with an observer's awareness. Some
questions of causality and determinism that arise from later-time boundary
conditions are touched upon.

natural images. Already at the level of the mammalian primary visual cortex
(V1), neurons respond best to lines of a given orientation. We reduce a set of
images to linear segments and analyze their statistical properties. In
particular, appropriately defined Fourier spectra show more power in their
transverse component than in the longitudinal one. We then characterize filters
that are best suited for extracting information from such images, and find some
qualitative consistency with neural connections in V1. We also demonstrate that
such filters are efficient in reconstructing missing lines in an image.

This is a two-dimensional spin system with a torus topology and nontrivial
four-body interactions between its spins. For a generic partition $(A,B)$ of
the lattice we calculate analytically the von Neumann entropy of the reduced
density matrix $\rho_A$ in the ground state. We prove that the geometric
entropy associated with a region $A$ is linear in the length of its boundary.
Moreover, we argue that entanglement can probe the topology of the system and
reveal topological order. Finally, no partition has zero entanglement and we
find the partition that maximizes the entanglement in the given ground state.
