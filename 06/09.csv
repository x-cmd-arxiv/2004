soft X-ray transient (SXT) XTE J1709-267 in outburst and quiescence. We further
report the detection of type I bursts in RXTE data obtained during an outburst
of the source in 2002. These bursts show a precursor event before the onset of
the main burst event, reminiscent of photospheric radius expansion bursts.
Sifting through the archival RXTE data for the burster 4U 1636-53 we found a
nearly identical burst with precursor in 4U 1636-53. A comparison of this burst
to true photospheric radius expansion bursts in 4U 1636-53 leads us to conclude
that these bursts-with-precursor do not reach the Eddington limit. We further
report on the analysis of a 22.4 ksec observation of XTE J1709-267 obtained
with the Chandra satellite when the source was in quiescence. We found that the
source has a soft quiescent spectrum which can be fit well by an absorbed black
body or neutron star atmosphere model. A power law contributes less than 10 per
cent to the 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux of (1.0+-0.3)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.
This flux is the same within the errors as the flux measured right after the
outburst in 2002, indicating that the quiescent flux was reached within a few
weeks after the outburst. Finally, we compared the power-law fractional
contribution to the unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity for neutron star SXTs in
quiescence for which the distance is well-known. We find that the power-law
contribution is low only when the source quiescent luminosity is close to
\~1-2x10^33 erg s^-1. Both at higher and lower values the power-law
contribution to the 0.5-10 keV luminosity increases. We discuss how models for
the quiescent X-ray emission can explain these trends.(Abridged)

relatively simple model. However, since the chi-squared statistic is not
sensitive to weak and/or localized fluctuations, we have performed Monte Carlo

the following. Jets propagating in a constant density atmosphere will
decelerate with time. Thus, the estimated dynamical age of the source will be
greater than the actual age of the source. For a source similar to Cygnus A the
difference will be about a factor of 2. The second moment gives an accurate
representation of the ""true"" width of the simulated source. The Gaussian FWHM
tends to be about 40% larger than the true width and can be systematically in

the overall observed morphology and the behavior of the cross-sections in

suggests that distant powerful radio galaxies (e.g. z>2) might be residing in

projects targetting fields with distant radio galaxies, including studies of
Lya and Ha emitters, Lyman break galaxies and (sub)mm and X-ray emitters, all

of the total mass of the proto-clusters are similar to the masses of local

our analysis are: i) the fitting accuracy of both theoretical libraries
drastically degrades at low Teff; ii) comparing with empirical calibrations,
both ATLAS and NextGen fits tend to predict slightly warmer Teff, but ATLAS
provides in general a sensibly better fit; iii) there is a striking tendency of
NextGen to label target stars with an effective temperature and surface gravity
in excess with respect to ATLAS. This is a consequence of some ``degeneracy''
in the solution space, partly induced by the different input physics and
geometry constraints. A different T(\tau) vertical structure of stellar
atmosphere seems also required for NextGen synthetic SEDs in order to better
account for limb-darkening effects in cool stars, as supported by the recent
observations of the EROS BLG2000-5 microlensing event.

a cool halo of X-ray gas within the cluster, with a highly sharpened leading
edge as it presumably falls into the cluster, and a cometary-like tail. We
estimate that some ~200-400 point sources are physically associated with
Fornax. Confirming earlier works, we find that the globular cluster population
in NGC 1399 is highly X-ray active, extending to globulars which may in fact be
intra-cluster systems. We have also found a remarkable correlation between the
location of giant and dwarf cluster galaxies and the presence of X-ray
counterparts, such that systems inhabiting regions of low gas density are more
likely to show X-ray activity. Not only does this correlate with the asymmetry
of the intra-cluster gas but also with the axis joining the center of Fornax to
an infalling group 1 Mpc to the South-West. We suggest that Fornax may be
experiencing an intergalactic ``headwind'' due to motion relative to the
surrounding large-scale structure.

interest in the formation of black holes massive enough to power quasars. If
black holes grow by Eddington-limited gas accretion with a radiative efficiency
of at least 10%, the time required to grow from a stellar black hole to ~10^9
msun is ~10^9 years, close to the age of the universe at z=6. Black hole
mergers may accelerate the rate of mass growth, but can also completely eject
black holes from halo centers owing to the gravitational wave recoil effect.
Recently, Haiman concluded that black hole ejections likely do not allow black
holes to grow to ~10^9 msun by z=6.43. We reexamine this problem and show that,
by using a different halo escape velocity, accounting for the dependence of the
recoil velocity on the black hole binary mass ratio and spins, and allowing
seed black holes to form in all halos down to virial temperatures of 2000 K,
black hole masses may reach ~10^9 msun as early as z=9 starting from stellar
seeds, without super-Eddington accretion. In this particular case, we find that
these massive black holes form from the merger of ~10^4 stellar black holes
formed in low-mass halos at z~20, which must all grow close to the maximum
Eddington rate over most of the time available from their birth to z~6. The
alternative is that black holes can grow more rapidly by super-Eddington
accretion.

velocity dispersions of the early type galaxies and AGN hosts to estimate their
black hole masses and we use the AGN [OIII]5007 emission line luminosities to
estimate black hole accretion rates. We find that most present-day accretion
occurs onto black holes with masses < 10E8 Msun that reside in moderately
massive galaxies (M ~ 10E10 to 10E11.5 Msun) with high stellar densities
(~10E8.5 to 10E9.5 Msun/kpc^2) and young stellar populations. The
volume-averaged accretion rates of low mass black holes (<10E7.5 Msun) imply
that this population is growing on a timescale that is comparable to the age of
the Universe. Around half this growth takes place in AGN that are radiating
within a factor of five of the Eddington luminosity. Such systems are rare,
making up only 0.2% of the low mass black hole population at the present day.
The rest of the growth occurs in lower luminosity AGN. The growth timescale is
more than two orders of magnitude longer for the population of the most massive
black holes in our sample. The volume averaged ratio of star formation to black
hole accretion in bulge-dominated galaxies is ~1000, in remarkable agreement
with the observed ratio of stellar mass to black hole mass in nearby galaxy
bulges. We conclude: a) that bulge formation and black hole formation are
tightly coupled, even in present-day galaxies; and b) that the evolution of the
AGN luminosity function documented in recent optical and x-ray surveys is
driven by a decrease in the characteristic mass scale of accreting black holes.

those of the early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of
low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early-types. The
hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages and a
significant fraction have experienced recent starbursts. High-luminosity AGN
are also found in lower density environments. We use the stellar velocity

infer the structure and strength of intra-cluster magnetic fields by comparing
our simulations with the observed polarization properties of extended cluster

require a magnetic field which fluctuates over a wide range of spatial scales
(at least one order of magnitude). If several polarized radio sources are
located at different projected positions in a galaxy cluster, as is the case
for A119, detailed Faraday rotation images allow us to constrain both the
magnetic field strength and the slope of the power spectrum. Our results show
that the standard analytic expressions applied in the literature overestimate
the cluster magnetic field strengths by a factor of about 2. We investigate the
possible effects of our models on beam depolarization of radio sources whose
radiation traverses the magnetized intracluster medium. Finally, we point out
that radio halos may provide important information about the spatial power
spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations on large scales. In particular,
different values of the index of the power spectrum produce very different
total intensity and polarization brightness distributions.

is due to the fact that both signals have basically the same spatial profile.
We find a new family of multifilters related to the matched multifilters that
cancel this systematic bias, hence we call them Unbiased Matched Multifilters.
We test the unbiased matched multifilters and compare them with the standard
matched multifilters using simulations that reproduce the future Planck
mission's observations. We find that in the case of the standard matched
multifilters the systematic bias in the estimation of the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect can be very large, even greater than the statistical
error bars. Unbiased matched multifilters cancel effectively this kind of bias.
In concordance with other works in the literature, our results indicate that
the sensitivity and resolution of Planck will not be enough to give reliable

with a central black hole which contains between 0.2% to 10% of the total
cluster mass.
  We find that for large enough black hole masses, the central density follows
a power-law distribution with slope \rho \sim r^{-1.75} inside the radius of
influence of the black hole, in agreement with predictions from earlier Fokker
Planck and Monte Carlo models. The tidal disruption rate of stars is within a
factor of two of that derived in previous studies. It seems impossible to grow
an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) from a M \le 100 Msun progenitor in a
globular cluster by the tidal disruption of stars, although M = 10^3 Msun IMBHs
can double their mass within a Hubble time in dense globular clusters. The same
is true for the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.
  Black holes in star clusters will feed mainly on stars tightly bound to them
and the re-population of these stars causes the clusters to expand, reversing
core-collapse without the need for dynamically active binaries. Close
encounters of stars in the central cusp also lead to an increased mass loss
rate in the form of high-velocity stars escaping from the cluster. A companion
paper will extend these results to the multi-mass case.

crust beyond the neutron drip threshold can be expected to be related to the
corresponding particle momentum covector $p_i$ by a linear relation of the form
$n^i=K^{ij}p_j$ in terms of a physically well defined mobility tensor $K^{ij}$.
This result is describable as an ``entrainment'' whose effect - wherever the
crust lattice is isotropic - will simply be to change the ordinary neutron mass
m to an effective mass $m_\star$ such that in terms of the relevant number
density n of unconfined neutrons we shall have $K^{ij}=n/m_\star\gamma^{ij}$.
In a preceding analysis based on an independent particle treatment using Bloch
boundary conditions to obtain the distribution of energy $E_k$ and associated
group velocity $v_k^i=\partial E_k/\partial\hbar k_i$ as a function of
wavenumber $k_i$, it was shown that the mobility tensor would be given by
$K^{ij}\propto\int d^3 k v_k^i v_k^j\delta\{E_k-\mu\}$, where $\mu$ is the
Fermi energy. Using the approach due to Bogoliubov, it is shown here that the
effect of BCS pairing with an energy gap \Delta_F and corresponding
quasiparticle energy function \EE_k=\sqrt{(E_k-\mu)^2+\Delta_F^2}$ will just be
to replace the Dirac distributional integrand by a smoother distribution :
$K^{ij}\propto \int d^3 k v_k^i v_k^j \Delta_F^2 /\EE^3_k$. It is also shown
how the pairing condensation gives rise to superfluidity in the technical sense
of providing (meta) stability against resistive perturbations for a current
that is not too strong (its momentum $p_i$ must be small enough to give $2|p_i
v_k^i|<\EE_k^2/|E_k-\mu|$ for all modes). It is concluded that the prediction
of a very large effective mass enhancement in the middle layers of the crust
will not be significantly affected by the pairing mechanism.

inferred from metal accretion. Hydrogen accretion is therefore suppressed
compared to metal accretion. The hypothesis most widely discussed as cause for
this ``hydrogen screening'' is the propeller mechanism: Metals are accreted in
the form of grains onto a slowly rotating, weakly magnetized white dwarf,
whereas ionized hydrogen is repelled at the Alfv\'en radius. We have obtained
circular polarization spectra of the helium-rich white dwarfs GD 40

and tidal disruption of stars.
  The (3D) mass density profile follows a power-law distribution \rho \sim
r^{-\alpha} with slope \alpha=1.55. This leads to a constant density profile of
bright stars in projection, which makes it highly unlikely that core collapse
clusters contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Instead globular

  Kinematical studies can reveal 1000 Msun IMBHs in the closest clusters. IMBHs
in globular clusters are only weak X-ray sources since the tidal disruption
rate of stars is low and the star closest to the IMBH is normally another black

the IMBH to distances small enough that they become detectable through

distribution of large scale power in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy

estimates of particular cosmological parameters vary when inferred from power
spectra computed separately on the northern and southern hemispheres in three
frames of reference. We focus our investigation on the three specific
parameters to which the analysis is most sensitive, the spectral index n, the
amplitude of fluctuations A and the optical depth tau. When using a gaussian
prior on the spectral index n centred at n=1 with a flat prior on the optical
depth tau, the preferred value for the optical depth (derived in the reference
frame of maximum asymmetry) in the north is tau=0 with upper limit tau<0.08,
whereas in the south we find tau=0.24 +0.06/-0.07 (68% confidence level). The
latter result is inconsistent with tau=0 at the 2 sigma level. The estimated
optical depth of tau=0.17 on the (nearly) full sky found by the WMAP
collaboration and confirmed independently here, could thus in large part
originate in structure associated with the southern hemisphere. Furthermore,
putting a prior on tau, we find values of the spectral index which are
inconsistent between the opposite hemispheres. The exact values depend on the
prior on tau. While our results should not be considered more than suggestive,
the significance of the parameter differences in the two hemispheres being
typically of order 2 sigma, if they are confirmed with the higher sensitivity
WMAP 2-year data then it may be necessary to question the assumption of
cosmological isotropy and the conceptual framework within which studies of the

stars and hence, since massive stars are short lived, are a tracer of star
formation activity. Given that GRBs are bright enough to be seen to very high
redshifts, and detected even in dusty environments, they should therefore
provide a powerful probe of the global star formation history of the universe.
The potential of this approach can be investigated via submm photometry of GRB
host galaxies. Submm luminosity also correlates with star formation rate, so
the distribution of host galaxy submm fluxes should allow us to test the two
methods for consistency. Here, we report new JCMT/SCUBA 850 micron measurements

construct a sample of 21 hosts with <1.4 mJy errors. We show that the

consistent with model predictions, but there is tentative evidence of a dearth
of submm bright (>4 mJy) galaxies. Furthermore, the optical/infrared properties
of the submm brightest GRB hosts are not typical of the galaxy population
selected in submm surveys, although the sample size is still small. Possible
selection effects and physical mechanisms which may explain these discrepancies

take into account energy stratification established by particle acceleration at
shock fronts and energy losses due to synchrotron emission. We also consider
the effect of light travel delays for the synchrotron emission that supplies
the seed photons for inverse Compton scattering. The production of a flare is
caused by the collision between a relativistic shock wave and a stationary
feature in the jet (e.g., a Mach disk). The collision leads to the formation of
forward and reverse shocks, which confine two contiguous emission regions
resulting in complex profiles of simulated flares. Simulations of
multifrequency flares indicate that relative delays between the inverse Compton
flares and their synchrotron counterparts are dominated by energy
stratification and geometry of the emitting regions, resulting in both negative
and positive time delays depending on the frequency of observation. Light
travel effects of the seed photons may lead to a noticeable delay of the
inverse Compton emission with respect to synchrotron variability if the line of
sight is almost perfectly aligned with the jet. We apply the model to a flare
in 3C 273 and derive the properties of shocked plasma responsible for the
flare. We show that the pronounced negative time delay between the X-ray and IR

trap axis. One consequence of this superflow anisotropy is vortex precession
about the trap axis in the absence of an imposed rotation. In the complementary
regime of a finite prescribed rotation, we compute the minimum-energy vortex
density, showing that in the rapid-rotation limit it is extremely uniform,
despite a strongly inhomogeneous (nearly) Thomas-Fermi condensate density
$\rho_s(r)$. The weak radially-dependent contribution ($\propto
\nabla^2\ln\rho_s(r)$) to the vortex distribution, that vanishes with the
number of vortices $N_v$ as $\frac{1}{N_v}$, arises from the interplay between
vortex quantum discretness (namely their inability to faithfully support the
imposed rigid-body rotation) and the inhomogeneous superfluid density. This
leads to an enhancement of the vortex density at the center of a typical
concave trap, a prediction that is in quantitative agreement with recent
experiments (cond-mat/0405240). One striking consequence of the inhomogeneous

are employed to study liquid-gas phase equilibria in size-disperse fluids. The
investigation is made subject to the constraint of fixed polydispersity, i.e.
the form of the `parent' density distribution $\rho^0(\sigma)$ of the particle
diameters $\sigma$, is prescribed. This is the experimentally realistic
scenario for e.g. colloidal dispersions. The simulations are used to obtain the
cloud and shadow curve properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid having diameters
distributed according to a Schulz form with a large (40%) degree of
polydispersity. Good qualitative accord is found with the results from a MFE
method study of a corresponding van der Waals model that incorporates
size-dispersity both in the hard core reference and the attractive parts of the
free energy. The results show that polydispersity engenders considerable
broadening of the coexistence region between the cloud curves. The principal
effect of fractionation in this region is a common overall scaling of the
particle sizes and typical inter-particle distances, and we discuss why this
effect is rather specific to systems with Schulz diameter distributions. Next,
by studying a family of such systems with distributions of various widths, we
estimate the dependence of the critical point parameters on $\delta$. In
contrast to a previous theoretical prediction, size-dispersity is found to
raise the critical temperature above its monodisperse value. Unusually for a
polydisperse system, the critical point is found to lie at or very close to the
extremum of the coexistence region in all cases. We outline an argument showing
that such behaviour will occur whenever size polydispersity affects only the
range, rather than the strength of the inter-particle interactions.

constants for O-Cu and O-O bond stretchings. Without phonons, this reduces to
the Hubbard Model, and allows purely electronic W=0 pairing. A W=0 pair is a
two-body singlet eigenstate of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, with no double
occupancy, which gets bound from interactions with background particles.
Indeed, this mechanism produces a Kohn-Luttinger-like pairing from the Hubbard
repulsion, provided that its symmetry is not severely distorted.
  From the many-body theory, a canonical transformation extracts the effective
two-body problem, which lends itself to numerical analysis in case studies. As
a test, we use as a prototype system the $\cu$ cluster. We show analytically

reinforce the electronic pairing. At intermediate and strong EP coupling and $U

term memory in the signs of trades (buys or sells). Lillo and Farmer have
recently suggested that these correlations are compensated by opposite long
ranged fluctuations in liquidity, with an otherwise permanent market impact,
challenging the scenario proposed in Quantitative Finance 4, 176 (2004), where
the impact is *transient*, with a power-law decay in time. The exponent of this
decay is precisely tuned to a critical value, ensuring simultaneously that
prices are diffusive on long time scales and that the response function is
nearly constant. We provide new analysis of empirical data that confirm and
make more precise our previous claims. We show that the power-law decay of the
bare impact function comes both from an excess flow of limit order opposite to
the market order flow, and to a systematic anti-correlation of the bid-ask
motion between trades, two effects that create a `liquidity molasses' which
dampens market volatility.

the problems raised in Kuchar's ``reduction ad absurdum''. In the case of
Parametrized Particle Dynamics, conventional quantum mechanics is recovered in
the ideal clock limit. When E=0 is among the continuous spectrum of the

Hilbert space $\clh_{\rm ph}$ from the generalized eigenvectors in (the
topological dual of) $\clh_{\rm aux}$. This allows the CPI to be applied to
these `continuous-spectrum' cases in a more rigorous fashion than that
described previously. The discrete spectrum case is also treated.

be used to describe QCD observables in the low-energy region in a

introduces a finite number of parameters that encode the short-distance physics
and that must be determined from experiment or numerical lattice QCD
simulations. In this thesis, we calculate a number of hadronic observables in
the quenched and partially quenched versions of CPT:
  Chiral corrections to B^(*) --> D^(*) at zero recoil are investigated in
quenched CPT. We study in detail the charge radii of the meson and baryon
octets, electromagnetic properties of the baryon decuplet, and the baryon
decuplet to octet electromagnetic transitions in both, quenched and partially
quenched CPT. We further show how effects due to the finite size of the lattice
can be accounted for in heavy meson CPT and calculate, as explicit examples,
neutral B meson mixing and the heavy-light meson decay constants. We also
demonstrate how one can account for effects due to finite lattice spacing in
the low-energy theories, considering as an example electromagnetic meson and
baryon properties.
  The results of our calculations are crucial to extrapolate quenched and
partially quenched lattice data from the heavier light quark masses used on the

(non-color-superconducting) degenerate quark matter as well as that of an
ultradegenerate electron gas. Long-range magnetic interactions lead to
non-Fermi-liquid behavior with an anomalous leading $T\ln T^{-1}$ term.
Depending on the thermodynamic potential used as starting point, this effect
appears as a consequence of the logarithmic singularity in the fermion
self-energy at the Fermi surface or directly as a contribution from the only
weakly screened quasistatic magnetic gauge bosons. We show that a calculation
of Boyanovsky and de Vega claiming the absence of a leading $T\ln T^{-1}$ term
missed it by omitting vector boson contributions to the internal energy. Using
a formulation which collects all nonanalytic contributions in bosonic ring
diagrams, we systematically calculate corrections beyond the well-known
leading-log approximation. The higher-order terms of the low-temperature
expansion turn out to also involve fractional powers $T^{(3+2n)/3}$ and we
explicitly determine their coefficients up to and including order $T^{7/3}$ as
well as the subsequent logarithmically enhanced term $T^3 \ln (c/T)$. We derive
also a hard-dense-loop resummed expression which contains the infinite series
of anomalous terms to leading order in the coupling and which we evaluate
numerically. At low temperatures, the resulting deviation of the specific heat
from its value in naive perturbation theory is significant in the case of
strongly coupled normal quark matter and thus of potential relevance for the
cooling rates of (proto-)neutron stars with a quark matter component.

a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles (modulo long-range magnetism), it is

these interactions is the existence of many binary bound states of
quasiparticles. Only $\bar q q$ ones have been so far directly seen on the

such bound states account for a significant part of the bulk properties such as
density and pressure. Using the same model, we evaluate the energy loss $dE/dx$

only in the narrow interval of temperatures $T=(1.4-1.7)T_c$. In contrast to

article only the problem of why the weak scale is so small in energy compared
to a presumed fundamental scale, being say the Planck scale -- by postulating
the zero or very small value of the cosmological constant not only for one but
for several vacua. This postulate corresponds to what we have called the
Multiple Point Principle, namely that there be many ``vacuum'' states with the
same energy density. We further assume that 6 top quarks and 6 anti-top quarks
can bind by Higgs exchange so strongly as to become tachyonic and form a
condensate. This gives rise to the possibility of having a phase transition
between vacua with and without such a condensate. The two vacua distinguished
by such a condensate will have the same cosmological constant provided the top
Yukawa coupling is about $1.1 \pm 0.2$, in good correspondence with the
experimental value. The further requirement that this value of the Yukawa
coupling, at the weak scale, be compatible with the existence of a third
vacuum, with a Higgs field expectation value of the order of the fundamental
scale, enforces a hierarchical scale ratio between the fundamental and weak
scales of order $10^{16}$ -- $10^{20}$.

to the WZW models with boundary. The approach permits to study in detail
possible boundary conditions that restrict the values of the fields on the

submanifolds are equipped with an additional geometric structure that is
summarized in the notion of a gerbe module and includes a twisted Chan-Paton
gauge field. Using the geometric approach, we present a complete classification
of the branes that conserve the diagonal current-algebra symmetry in the WZW
models with simple, compact but not necessarily simply connected target groups.
Such symmetric branes are supported by a discrete series of conjugacy classes
in the target group and may carry Abelian or non-Abelian twisted gauge fields.
The latter situation occurs for the conjugacy classes with fundamental group
Z_2\times Z_2 in SO(4n)/Z_2. The branes supported by such conjugacy classes
have to be equipped with a projectively flat twisted U(2) gauge field in one of
the two possible WZW models differing by discrete torsion. We show how the
geometric description of branes leads to explicit formulae for the boundary
partition functions and boundary operator product coefficients in the WZW

standard normal density (this happens in particular by the CLT when X_1 has
zero mean and finite variance \sigma^2, with a_n = \sigma \sqrt{n}). A local
refinement of this convergence is provided by Gnedenko's and Stone's Local
Limit Theorems, in the lattice and nonlattice case respectively.

inelastic scattering (DIS) off complex nuclei in the kinematic regime of the
HERMES experiment. The analysis is carried out in the framework of a
probabilistic coupled-channel transport model based on the
Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) equation, which allows for a treatment of the
final-state interactions (FSI) beyond simple absorption mechanisms.
Furthermore, our event-by-event simulations account for the kinematic cuts of
the experiments as well as the geometrical acceptance of the detectors. We
calculate the multiplicity ratios of charged hadrons for various nuclear
targets relative to deuterium as a function of the photon energy nu, the hadron
energy fraction z_h=E_h/nu and the transverse momentum p_T. We also confront
our model results on double-hadron attenuation with recent experimental data.
Separately, we compare the attenuation of identified hadrons (pi^\pm, \pi^0,
K^\pm, p and pbar) on Ne and Kr targets with the data from the HERMES
Collaboration and make predictions for a Xe target. At the end we turn towards
hadron attenuation on Cu nuclei at EMC energies. Our studies demonstrate that
(pre-)hadronic final-state interactions play a dominant role in the kinematic
regime of the HERMES experiment while our present approach overestimates the
attenuation at EMC energies.

one definite limit, the so-called quantum random walk is recovered but,

far beyond this problem. Generally speaking, our framework can describe the
motion of an electron in a magnetic sea near the Fermi level when linearisation
of the dispersion law is possible, coupled to a transverse magnetic field.
Quite unexpected behaviours are obtained. In particular, we find that when the
initial wave packet is fully localized in space, the $J_{z}$ angular momentum
component is frozen; this is an interesting example of an observable which,
although it is not a constant of motion, has a constant expectation value. For
a non-completely localized wave packet, the effect still occurs although less
pronounced, and the spin keeps for ever memory of its initial state. Generally
speaking, as time goes on, the spatial density profile looks rather complex, as
a consequence of the competition between drift and precession, and displays
various shapes according to the ratio between the Larmor period and the
characteristic time of flight. The density profile gradually changes from a
multimodal quickly moving distribution when the scatttering rate is small, to a
