selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) and imaged in broad band B
and R and narrow band H-alpha to deduce details about star formation in nearby
disk galaxies while avoiding surface brightness selection effects. The sample
is dominated by late-type, dwarf disks (mostly Sc and Sm galaxies) with
exponential disk scale lengths of about 1 to 5 kpc. The HIPASS galaxies on
average have lower star formation rates (SFRs) and are bluer and lower surface
brightness than an optically selected sample. HII regions were detected in all
but one of the galaxies. Many galaxies had as few as two to five HII regions.
The galaxies' H-alpha equivalent widths, colors, and SFRs per unit HI mass are
best explained by young mean ages (about 3 to 5 Gyr according to Schmidt Law
models) with star formation histories where the SFRs were higher in the past.
Comparison of the surface brightness coverage of the HIPASS galaxies with that
of an optically selected sample shows that such a sample may miss about 10% of
the local galaxy number density and could possibly miss as much as 3 to 4% of
the SFR density. The amount lower surface brightness galaxies contribute to the
total luminosity density may be insignificant, but this conclusion is somewhat
dependent on how the fluxes of these objects are determined.

measure the baryon abundance and the value derived from the observationally

non-BBN data, primarily from the WMAP survey. However, using this same estimate
there is a tension between the SBBN-predicted 4He and 7Li abundances and their
current, observationally inferred primordial abundances, suggesting that N_nu
may differ from the standard model value of three and/or that there may be a
non-zero neutral lepton asymmetry (or, that systematic errors in the abundance
determinations have been underestimated or overlooked). The differences are not
large and the allowed ranges of the BBN parameters permitted by the data are
quite small. Within these ranges, the BBN-predicted abundances of D, 3He, 4He,

asymmetry. It is possible to describe the dependencies of these abundances (or
powers of them) upon the three parameters by simple, linear fits which, over
their ranges of applicability, are accurate to a few percent or better. The
fits presented here have not been maximized for their accuracy but, for their
simplicity. To identify the ranges of applicability and relative accuracies,
they are compared to detailed BBN calculations; their utility is illustrated
with several examples. Given the tension within BBN, these fits should prove
useful in facilitating studies of the viability of proposals for non-standard

X-ray imaging and optical studies indicated a merger of two subclusters nearly
in the plane of the sky. We derive a temperature map for A168, which shows that
the merger has proceeded beyond the core passage and is near subcluster
turnaround. It also reveals an unusual feature -- the gas core of one of the
subclusters forms a tongue-like structure extending ahead (in the direction of
motion) of the subcluster center. The coolest cluster gas is found in a
crescent-shaped region at the tip of this tongue, and forms a cold front in
pressure equilibrium with the external gas. In contrast with this feature's
forward location, previously observed merger cold fronts (e.g., A3667,
1E0657--56) lagged behind their host subclusters, as expected in the presense
of ram pressure. We propose that A168 illustrates a much later stage in the
evolution of a cold front, when its host subcluster approaches the apocenter of
the merger orbit where the ram pressure on its gas drops sharply. As a result,
a large chunk of the subcluster gas ``slingshots'' past the dark matter center,
becomes unbound from the subcluster and expands adiabatically, as seen in some
recent hydrodynamic simulations.

emission and evidence for protoplanetary disks associated with the faint,
substellar population of this young cluster, and to investigate the nature and
extent of a recently discovered population of deeply embedded sources located
in dense molecular gas behind the cluster. Examining the infrared colors of 38
luminosity and 24 spectroscopically selected substellar candidates we determine
an infrared excess fraction of 50+/-20% from the JHKsLp colors for both
samples. This finding confirms the presence of infrared excess, likely due to
circumstellar disks, around a significant fraction of the cluster's substellar
population. Our deep Lp imaging survey also provides new information concerning
the deeply embedded population of young objects located in the molecular cloud
behind the cluster; in particular, it doubles the number of sources in the
cluster region known to possess extremely red K-L colors. These objects exhibit
K-Lp colors indicative of deeply buried, possibly protostellar, objects that
likely mark the site of the most recent and ongoing star formation in the
region. We find the surface density distribution of the deeply embedded
population to follow that of the background molecular ridge and to be highly
structured, consisting of a string of at least 5 significant subclusters. These
subclusters may represent the primordial building blocks out of which the
cluster was and perhaps still is being assembled. These observations may thus
provide insights into the early stages of cluster formation and appear
consistent with recent simulations that suggest that the Trapezium cluster may
have formed from numerous but small primordial subclusters.

generation of the mean magnetic field even in a nonrotating and nonhelical
homogeneous turbulence (where $\bar{\bf W}$ is the mean vorticity and $\bar{\bf

the nonlinear ""shear-current"" effect contrary to the quenching of the nonlinear

changes its sign at some value $\bar{\bf B}_\ast$ of the mean magnetic field.
The magnitude $\bar{\bf B}_\ast$ determines the level of the saturated mean
magnetic field which is less than the equipartition field. It is shown that the
background magnetic fluctuations due to the small-scale dynamo enhance the
""shear-current"" effect, and reduce the magnitude $\bar{\bf B}_\ast$. When the
level of the background magnetic fluctuations is larger than 1/3 of the kinetic
energy of the turbulence, the mean magnetic field can be generated due to the

result, there has recently been increased interest in models in which either
radiative cooling or entropy injection play a central role in mediating the

to the mean properties of clusters, but cooling only models result in fractions
of cold baryons in excess of observationally established limits and the
simplest entropy injection models do not treat the ""cooling core"" structure
present in many clusters and cannot account for entropy profiles revealed by
recent X-ray observations. We consider models that marry radiative cooling with
entropy injection, and confront model predictions for the global and structural
properties of massive clusters with the latest X-ray data. The models
successfully and simultaneously reproduce the observed L-T and L-M relations,
yield detailed entropy, surface brightness, and temperature profiles in
excellent agreement with observations, and predict a cooled gas fraction that
is consistent with observational constraints. The model also provides a
possible explanation for the significant intrinsic scatter present in the L-T

classically identified as ""cooling flow"" clusters and dynamically relaxed
""non-cooling flow"" clusters. The former correspond to systems that had only
mild levels (< 300 keV cm^2) of entropy injection, while the latter are
identified as systems that had much higher entropy injection. This is borne out

forthcoming surveys that will identify clusters based on their X-ray emission

deliver a constraint as tight as $\Delta w_a \sim 0.1$ on the evolution of the
dark energy equation of state, and that the X-ray and SZ surveys each yield
$\Delta w_a \sim 0.4$ separately, or $\Delta w_a \sim 0.2$ when these two

Timing Explorer observations that were performed as part of a multi-wavelength
campaign, as well as six observations from the early rise of the outburst. The
source was observed in several black hole states and showed various types of
X-ray variability, including high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)
at 240 Hz and 160 Hz (i.e. with a 3:2 frequency ratio), several types of low
frequency QPOs, and strong variations on a time scale of a few hundred seconds.
The discovery of high frequency QPOs in H1743-322 supports predictions that
these QPOs should be more easily observed in high inclination systems. In one
of our observations we observed a transition in count rate and color, during
which we were able to follow the smooth evolution of the low-frequency QPOs
from type-B to type-A. We classify the X-ray observations and QPOs, and briefly
discuss the QPOs in terms of recently proposed models.

$\frac{dp}{dR}=-\frac{GM}{R^2}\rho$ has been widely adopted for quit a long
time. But, in this form, a factor has been neglected: the centrifugal force
that due to the thermal motion of gaseous particles in a centripetal force
field. The pressure gradient is actually caused by the ``effective weight''
$f_g^{^{\prime}}$ of gaseous particles but not by their real gravity $f_g$. For
this reason, a modified form of the pressure gradient is given in this paper.

in a ``redder when faint'' manner, consistent with changes along the line of

in the 3.05um water-ice feature is seen only in the spectra of T Tau S and it
displays variations in depth and profile. H_2 (2.12 um) emission is also
detected only at the position of T Tau S; the H_2, Br gamma and Br alpha

of the North spot is modulated at Jupiter's rotation period. We do not detect

Therefore photometric redshift methods employing both galaxy and QSO templates
need to be used. We employ the photometric redshift technique of
Hatziminaoglou, Mathez & Pello (2000) using 5-band photometry from the SDSS. We
separate our X-ray sources according to their optical profile to point-like and
extended. We apply QSO and galaxy templates to the point-like and extended
sources respectively. X-ray sources associated with Galactic stars are
identified and discarded from our point-like sample on the basis of their low
X-ray--to--optical flux ratio and their broad band colours that are best fit by
stellar templates. Comparison of our results with spectroscopic redshifts
available, allows calibration of our method and estimation of the photometric
redshift accuracy. For ~70 per cent of the point-like sources photometric
redshifts are correct within dz <= 0.3 (or ~75 per cent have dz/(1+z) <= 0.2),
and the rms scatter is estimated to be sigma_z = 0.30. For the optically
extended objects the photometric redshifts work only in the case of red (g - r

technique does not work in the case of extended sources with blue colours (g -

suspension has been investigated by the dynamic light scattering determination
of the density autocorrelation function. Though a stationary state is never
observed, the slow dynamics crosses between two different non-equilibrium
regimes as soon as the structural relaxation time approaches the inverse shear
rate. In the shear dominated regime (at high shear rate values) the structural
relaxation time is found to be strongly sensitive to shear rate while aging
proceeds at a very slow rate. The effect of shear on the detailed shape of the
density autocorrelation function is quantitatively described assuming that the
structural relaxation process arises from the heterogeneous superposition of
many relaxing units each one independently coupled to shear with a parallel
composition rule for timescales.

thus showing strong fluctuations. We consider the effect of three important
control parameters for the system: the packing fraction, the drag velocity and
the size of the tracer particle. We find that the mean drag force increases as
a power-law (exponent of 1.5) in the reduced packing fraction, $(\gamma -
\gamma_c)/\gamma_c$, as $\gamma$ passes through a critical packing fraction,
$\gamma_c$. By comparison, the mean drag grows slowly (basically logarithmic)
with the drag velocity, showing a weak rate-dependence. However, the system
nevertheless exhibits strong statistical invariance in the sense that many
physical quantities collapse onto a single curve under appropriate scaling. We
also show that the system can be understood using simple failure models, which
reproduce many experimental observations. These experimental data and

constraint as a restriction on the representations summed over. We obtain the
expected partition function, thus providing support for the viability of the
technique. The result requires the nontrivial topology of the bundle where the
gravitational connection is defined, to be taken into account. For this
purpose, we study the definition of a principal bundle over a simplicial base
space. The model sheds light also on several other features of spinfoam quantum
gravity: the reality of the partition function; the geometrical interpretation
of the Newton constant, and the issue of possible finiteness of the partition
function of quantum general relativity.

the tau Yukawa coupling that we derived for completeness. The computation is

on Mh due to the experimental error in the measurement of the SM input

phenomenological consequences, using the latest value of the top quark mass. We

equations of motion and one of the usual Einstein equations (suitably
quantized) survives as a constraint equation to be imposed on the space of
physical states. However, the Friedmann equation, which is also a constraint
equation and which is the basis of the Wheeler-deWitt equation, acquires a
welcome quantum correction that becomes significant for small scale factors. To
clarify the general formalism and explicitly show why we choose to weaken the
statement of the Wheeler-deWitt equation, we apply the general formalism to de
Sitter space. After exactly solving the relevant Heisenberg equations of motion
we give a detailed discussion of the subtleties associated with defining
physical states and the emergence of the classical theory. This computation
provides the striking result that quantum corrections to this long wavelength
limit of gravity eliminate the problem of the {\it big crunch}. We also show
that the same corrections lead to possibly measurable effects on the CMB
radiation. For the sake of completeness, we discuss the special case,
$\Lambda=0$, and its relation to Minkowski space. Finally, we suggest
interesting ways in which these techniques can be generalized to cast light on
the question of chaotic or eternal inflation. In particular, we suggest one can
put an experimental lower bound on the distance to a universe with a scale
factor very different from our own, by looking at its effects on our CMB

first shown that higher derivative theories are neatly dealt with by the path
integral formulation, and the underlying canonical structure is recovered by
the Bjorken-Johnson-Low (BJL) prescription from correlation functions defined
by the path integral. A simple theory which is non-local in time is then
analyzed for an illustration of the complications related to quantization,
unitarity and positive energy conditions. From the view point of BJL
prescription, the naive quantization in the interaction picture is justified
for space-time noncommutative theory but not for the simple theory non-local in
time. We finally show that the perturbative unitarity and the positive energy
condition, in the sense that only the positive energy flows in the positive
time direction for any fixed time-slice in space-time, are not simultaneously
satisfied for space-time noncommutative theory by the known methods of

In this paper we investigate the problem of finding an explicit element whose

the associated polytopes are essential. We reduce the problem to finding a
collection of partitions of the lattice points in the polytopes satisfying a
certain combinatorial property. We use this description to solve the problem

of faces. The latter generalizes earlier results when the divisors were all

rational convex polyhedron and their encoding in terms of Barvinok's short
rational functions. The first part of this thesis looks into theoretical
applications of these rational functions to Optimization, Statistics, and
Computational Algebra. The main theorem on Chapter 2 concerns the computation
of the \emph{toric ideal} $I_A$ of an integral $n \times d$ matrix $A$. We
encode the binomials belonging to the toric ideal $I_A$ associated with $A$
using Barvinok's rational functions. If we fix $d$ and $n$, this representation
allows us to compute a universal Gr\""obner basis and the reduced Gr\""obner
basis of the ideal $I_A$, with respect to any term order, in polynomial time.
We derive a polynomial time algorithm for normal form computations which
replaces in this new encoding the usual reductions of the division algorithm.
Chapter 3 presents three ways to use Barvinok's rational functions to solve
Integer Programs.
  The second part of the thesis is experimental and consists mainly of the
software package {\tt LattE}, the first implementation of Barvinok's algorithm.
We report on experiments with families of well-known rational polytopes:
multiway contingency tables, knapsack type problems, and rational polygons. We
also developed a new algorithm, {\em the homogenized Barvinok's algorithm} to
compute the generating function for a rational polytope. We showed that it runs
in polynomial time in fixed dimension. With the homogenized Barvinok's
algorithm, we obtained new combinatorial formulas: the generating function for
the number of $5\times 5$ magic squares and the generating function for the
number of $3\times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ magic cubes as rational functions.

short-range contributions from pion-loops are encoded in a few NN-contact
coupling constants. The empirical saturation point of isospin-symmetric nuclear
matter, $\bar E_0 = -16 $MeV, $\rho_0 = 0.16 $fm$^{-3}$, can be well reproduced
by adjusting the strength of a two-body term linear in density (and weakening
an emerging three-body term quadratic in density). The nuclear matter
compressibility comes out as $K = 304 $MeV. The real single-particle potential
$U(p,k_{f0})$ is substantially improved by the inclusion of the chiral $\pi
N\Delta$-dynamics: it grows now monotonically with the nucleon momentum $p$.
The effective nucleon mass at the Fermi surface takes on a realistic value of
$M^*(k_{f0})=0.88M$. As a consequence of these features, the critical
temperature of the liquid-gas phase transition gets lowered to the value $T_c
\simeq 15 $MeV. In this work we continue the complex-valued single-particle
potential $U(p,k_f)+i W(p,k_f)$ into the region above the Fermi surface
$p>k_f$. The effects of $2\pi$-exchange with virtual $\Delta$-excitation on the
nuclear energy density functional are also investigated. The effective nucleon
mass associated with the kinetic energy density is $\widetilde M^*(\rho_0)=
0.64M$. Furthermore, we find that the isospin properties of nuclear matter get

quasistationary value given by Kramers' formula. The nature of fission
transients is dependent on the assumed initial distribution of the compound
nuclei along the fission coordinate. Although the standard initial assumption
of a near-spherical object leads to a transient suppression of the fission rate
(fission delay), a moderate initial fissionlike deformation can reduce the
magnitude of this suppression. For still larger initial deformations, transient
fission enhancements are possible. Examples of this behavior are illustrated
via a one-dimensional Langevin simulation. It is argued that the initial
conditions are determined by the fusion dynamics and thus are entrance-channel
dependent. Transient fission may be considered intermediate between statistical
fission and quasifission as the rapid time scale of transient fission may not
lead to an equilibrium of the angular and mass-asymmetry coordinates. The
relationship between the mean first passage time and the transients are
discussed. For temperatures much smaller than the fission barrier, the mean
first passage time is independent of the nature of the fission transients if
there is no strong competition from evaporation. Thus, fission transients are
most important when the evaporation time scale is smaller than, or of the order
of, the transient time.

an optimization method to minimize the average dose difference has been used in
this study. The relationship between the dose-verification procedure and the

to work out a succesful strategy for reading the native structure of designed
proteins from the knowledge of only their amino acid sequence and of the
contact energies among the amino acids. Because LES have undergone millions of
years of evolution to selectively dock to their complementary structures, small
peptides made out of the same amino acids as the LES are expected to
selectively attach to the newly expressed (unfolded) protein and inhibit its

Phys. 125 (2006) 821-840","10.1007/s10955-006-9227-3",,"quant-ph",,"  Carrying out a research program outlined by John S. Bell in 1987, we arrive
at a relativistic version of the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) model of
spontaneous wavefunction collapse. The GRW model was proposed as a solution of
the measurement problem of quantum mechanics and involves a stochastic and
nonlinear modification of the Schr\""odinger equation. It deviates very little
from the Schr\""odinger equation for microscopic systems but efficiently
suppresses, for macroscopic systems, superpositions of macroscopically
different states. As suggested by Bell, we take the primitive ontology, or
local beables, of our model to be a discrete set of space-time points, at which
the collapses are centered. This set is random with distribution determined by
the initial wavefunction. Our model is nonlocal and violates Bell's inequality
though it does not make use of a preferred slicing of space-time or any other
sort of synchronization of spacelike separated points. Like the GRW model, it
reproduces the quantum probabilities in all cases presently testable, though it
entails deviations from the quantum formalism that are in principle testable.
Our model works in Minkowski space-time as well as in (well-behaved) curved
background space-times.

game when their moves are performed on pairs of objects having correlations

symmetric bi-matrix game. Also the Nash equilibria of the game are found to be
