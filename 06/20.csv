show that conventional physics, which includes plasma redshift, fully explains
the observed magnitude-redshift relation of the supernovas. The only parameter
that is required is the Hubble constant, which in principle can be measured
independently. The contemporary theory of the expansion of the universe (Big
Bang) requires in addition to the Hubble constant several adjustable
parameters, such as an initial explosion, the dark matter parameter, and a time
adjustable dark energy parameter for explaining the supernova Ia data. The
contemporary Big Bang theory also requires time dilation of distant events as
an inherent premise. The contention is usually that the light curves of distant
supernovas show or even prove the time dilation. In the present article, we
challenge this assertion. We document and show that the previously reported
data in fact indicate that there is no time dilation. The data reported by
Riess et al. in the Astrophysical Journal in June 2004 confirm the plasma
redshift, the absence of time dilation, dark matter, and dark energy.

main component of the supernova (which we call the bulk supernova for short)
scatters off electrons in the jets and is polarized: this polarized light is
added to the direct emission from the bulk supernova and causes the overall
supernova emission to be polarized. The motivation for the bipolar jet model is
to resolve the potential paradox set by an analysis which suggests strong
spherical symmetry for Type Ib supernovae and the expectation that Type Ib
supernovae should be highly polarized in the continuum up to perhaps about 4 %.
For the model we have derived simple, non-relativistic, approximate analytic
formulae for relative amount of scattered flux and polarization. The
polarization formula qualitatively reproduces two main features observed for at
least some supernovae: (1) the rise to a polarization maximum and then decline
with time; (2) the inverted P Cygni polarization profiles of lines. The model
is strictly axisymmetric and predicts a constant position angle of intrinsic
polarization. Since position angle variation of intrinsic polarization is
observed, the model cannot account for all the polarization of all supernovae.

We take VIRGO as the reference for our considerations, solely applicable to the
inspiralling phase of a coalescing binary. Thus, only neutron stars and small
black holes of few solar masses are encompassed by our analysis. The
contributions to the SNR given by final merge and quasi-normal ringing are
neglected. It is identified that i) the reduction in the mirror thermal noise
band provides the highest gain for the SNR, when the VIRGO bandwidth is divided
according to the dominant noises; ii) it exists a specific frequency at which
lies the potential largest increment in the SNR, and that the enlargement of
the bandwidth, where the noise is reduced, produces a shift of such optimal
frequency to higher values; iii) the abatement of the pendulum thermal noise
provides the largest, but modest, gain, when noise sources are considered
separately. Our recent astrophysical analysis on event rates for neutron stars
leads to a detection rate of one every 148 or 125 years for VIRGO and LIGO,

classical system to be quantized. This permits the Hamiltonian constraint
equation to be consistently turned into an expectation value equation on
quantization that describes the scale factor on each spatial hypersurface
characterized by a constant mean exterior curvature. This expectation value
equation augments the dynamical quantum evolution of the unconstrained
conformal three-geometry with a transverse traceless momentum tensor density.
The resulting quantum theory is inherently nonlinear. Nonetheless, it is
unitary and free from a nonlocal and implicit description of the Hamiltonian
operator. Finally, by imposing additional homogeneity symmetries, a broad class

amplitude is calculated at one-loop level in the framework of Chiral
Perturbation Theory. The interest in this process is twofold: It is actually
measured by the NA48 collaboration from one side, and, the value of the
amplitude at the $\pi\pi$ threshold gives access to $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths
from the other side. We found that the present correction is about 5 to 6% the
value of the Born amplitude squared. Combined with another piece published
recently, this fixes the size of isospin breaking correction to the amplitude
squared to 7% its one-loop level value in the absence of isospin breaking and
at the center of Dalitz plot.

  Moyal Star Product and Matrix Model","15 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  Noncommutative field theory on Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YSTA) is
studied. It gives a theoretical framework to reformulate the matrix model as
quantum mechanics of $D_0$ branes in a Lorentz-covariant form. The so-called
kinetic term ($\sim {\hat{P_i}}^2)$ and potential term ($\sim
{[\hat{X_i},\hat{X_j}]}^2)$ of $D_0$ branes in the matrix model are described
now in terms of Casimir operator of $SO(D,1)$, a subalgebra of the primary
algebra $SO(D+1,1)$ which underlies YSTA with two contraction- parameters,
$\lambda$ and $R$. $D$-dimensional noncommutative space-time and momentum
operators $\hat{X_\mu}$ and $\hat{P_\mu}$ in YSTA show a distinctive spectral
structure, that is, space-components $\hat{X_i}$ and $\hat{P_i}$ have discrete
eigenvalues, and time-components $\hat{X_0}$ and $\hat{P_0}$ continuous
eigenvalues, consistently with Lorentz-covariance. According to the method of
Lorentz-covariant Moyal star product proper to YSTA, the field equation of
$D_0$ brane on YSTA is derived in a nontrivial form beyond simple Klein-Gordon
equation, which reflects the noncommutative space-time structure of YSTA.

with the cohomology of Out(F_r), Morita defined a sequence of 4k-dimensional
classes mu_k in the unstable rational homology of Out(F_{2k+2}). He showed by a
computer calculation that the first of these is non-trivial, so coincides with
the unique non-trivial rational homology class for Out(F_4). Using the
""forested graph complex"" introduced in [Algebr. Geom. Topol. 3 (2003)
1167--1224], we reinterpret and generalize Morita's cycles, obtaining an
unstable cycle for every connected odd-valent graph. (Morita has independently
found similar generalizations of these cycles.) The description of Morita's
original cycles becomes quite simple in this interpretation, and we are able to
show that the second Morita cycle also gives a nontrivial homology class.
Finally, we view things from the point of view of a different chain complex,
one which is associated to Bestvina and Feighn's bordification of outer space.
We construct cycles which appear to be the same as the Morita cycles
constructed in the first part of the paper. In this setting, a further
generalization becomes apparent, giving cycles for objects more general than
odd-valent graphs. Some of these cycles lie in the stable range. We also
observe that these cycles lift to cycles for Aut(F_r).
