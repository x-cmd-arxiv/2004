function anisotropy (PSF) across the CCDs. We show that the small scale
systematics can be minimised, and eventually suppressed, using the B mode
(curled shear component)measured in the corrected stars and galaxies. Updated
cosmological constraints are obtained, free of systematics caused by PSF
anisotropy. To facilitate general use of our results, we provide the two-points
statistics data points with their covariance matrices up to a scale of one
degree. For the normalisation of the mass power spectrum we obtain
sigma_8=(0.83\pm 0.07)(Omega_M/0.3)^(-0.49). The shape parameter Gamma was
marginalised over Gamma=[0.1,0.3] and the mean source redshift z_s over
[0.8,1.0]. The latter is consistent with recent photometric redshifts obtained
for the VIRMOS data and the preliminary spectroscopic redshifts from the
VIRMOS-VVDS survey. The quoted 68% contour level includes all identified
sources of error. We discuss the possible sources of residual contamination in
this result: the effect of the non-linear mass power spectrum and remaining
issues concerning the PSF correction. Our result is compared with the first

planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Here we critically revise its
viability by noting that for the direct production of giant planets it is not
enough for protoplanetary disks to be gravitationally unstable. They must also
be able to cool efficiently (on a timescale comparable to the local disk
orbital period) to allow the formation of bound clumps by fragmentation.
Combination of dynamical and thermal constraints puts very stringent lower
limits on the surface density and temperature of disks capable of fragmenting
into self-gravitating objects: for the gravitational instability to form giant
planets at 10 AU gas temperature at this location must exceed 10^3 K for a
minimum disk mass of 0.7 M_Sun and minimum disk luminosity of 40 L_Sun.
Although these requirements relax in more distant parts of the disk, masses of
bound objects formed as a result of instability even at 100 AU are too large
(\sim 10 M_Jupiter) to explain characteristics of known extrasolar giant
planets. Such protoplanetary disks (and planets formed in them) have very
unusual observational properties and this severely constrains the possibility
of giant planet formation by direct gravitational instability.

recent (~10 Myr) star formation outside of region A, the sources of ionizing
radiation as observed in both radio and Br-gamma observations are almost
exclusively associated with region A. The derived ionizing flux implies a star
formation rate of ~0.6 solar masses per year localized within a radius of ~0.1
kpc. A comparison with observations from HST indicates that one or more of the
star clusters in region A are optically obscured. The star clusters in region A
have ages at least as young as ~5 Myr, and possibly as young as ~0.1 Myr. The

its colors, possibly indicating natal dust in very close proximity to the

starburst in region A is inferred from both the near-IR and radio observations
to be ~10^6 solar masses. The other main stellar concentrations observed in the

an inflationary context, the anticorrelation may be established if the

such models however tend to overpredict gravitational waves. This isocurvature
model can in the future be distinguished from alternatives involving a
reduction in large scale power or modifications to the sound speed of the dark

the zenith angle of the charged leptons and those of their incident neutrinos,
taking into account the effect of the azimuthal angle of the charged particle

the zenith angle of the incident neutrino to that of the charged lepton, and so
the zenith angle distribution of charged leptons does not reflect that of the

10^-8<Xe<10^-6. The physical origin of these large variations in Xe is not well
understood, unless unlikely variations in the cosmic ray ionization rate or ad
hoc values of metal depletion are assumed. In this work we explore other
potential causes of these variations in Xe, including core age, extinction and
density. We compute numerically the intensity of the radiation field within a
density distribution generated by supersonic turbulence. Taking into account
the lines of sight in all directions, the effective visual extinction in dense
regions is found to be always much lower than the extinction derived from the
column density along a fixed line of sight. Dense cores with volume and column
densities comparable to observed protostellar cores have relatively low
mass-averaged visual extinction, 2mag <= A_V <= 5mag, such that
photo-ionization can sometimes be as important as cosmic ray ionization.
Chemical models, including gas-grain chemistry and time dependent gas depletion
and desorption, are computed for values of visual extinction in the range 2mag
<= A_V <= 6mag, and for a hydrogen gas density of 10^4cm^-3$, typical of
protostellar cores. The models presented here can reproduce some of the
observed variations of ion abundance from core to core as the combined effect
of visual extinction and age variations. The range of electron abundances
predicted by the models is relatively insenstive to density over 10^4 to 10^6

with IUE, appears to consist of an optical stellar population very similar to
that of the compact, dwarf elliptical M32, which is several magnitudes fainter
in luminosity than NGC5018 and whose stellar population is know to be ~3 Gyr
old. Here we show that the mid-UV spectra of these two galaxies are also very
similar down to an angular scale hundreds times smaller than the IUE large
aperture (as probed by HST/FOS UV spectra obtained through 0.86 arcsec
apertures). This implies a reasonably close match of the populations dominating
their mid-UV light (namely, their main-sequence turnoff stars). These data
indicate that NGC5018 has, in its inner regions, a rather uniform dominance of
a ~3 Gyr-old stellar population, probably a bit different in metallicity from
M32. Combined with the various structures that indicate that NGC5018 is the
result of a recent major merger, it appears that almost all of stars we see in
its center regions were formed about 3 Gyr ago, in that merger event. NGC5018
is likely the older brother of NGC7252, the canonical gE-in-formation merger.
As such, NGC5018 is perhaps the best galaxy which can tell us how a merger
works, after the fireworks subside, to form a gE galaxy today. For this reason
alone, the stellar populations in NGC5018 at all radii are worth studying in
detail.

compared to the usual 11.2-3 $\mu$m crystalline forsterite feature detected

Fe-bearing silicates are commonly found in meteorites and most interplanetary

studies of meteorites, Fe-bearing silicate must have been formed in asteroidal
planetesimals, supporting the scenario that dust grains around Vega-like stars

significantly long diffusion times through the strong infra-red fields. Two

speculate that the stability of BHR may be further protected by supersymmetry

sufficient amount of small black holes can be produced in the early universe,
then the resultant BHRs can be an interesting candidate for DM. We demonstrate
that this is the case in the hybrid inflation model. By assuming BHR as DM, our

surfactants are modeled as coarse-grained lattice polymers, while the Monte
Carlo shear flow is implemented with an externally imposed potential energy
field which induces a linear drag velocity on the surfactants. It is shown that
in the absence of shear, cylindrical micelles confined within a monolayer
coarsen gradually with Monte Carlo ""time"" t, the persistence length of the
micelles scaling as t^{0.24}, in agreement with the scaling obtained
experimentally. Under the imposition of shear, the micelles within a monolayer
align parallel to the direction of shear, as observed experimentally. Micelles
confined within thicker films also align parallel to each other with a
hexagonal packing under shear, but assume a finite tilt with respect to the

mechanism for this shear-induced alignment of micelles based on breaking up of
micelles aligned perpendicular to shear and their reformation and subsequent
growth in the shear direction. It is observed that there exists a ""window"" of

  We analyze the computational complexity of the orientation problem and show
that while several variants of the problem are $NP$-hard, inapproximable and
fixed-parameter intractable, some restrictions are polynomial-time approximable
within a constant factor or even solvable in logarithmic space. The orientation
search problem is formalized as a constrained line arrangement problem that is
of independent interest. The negative complexity results give a partial
justification for the heuristic methods used in orientation search, and the
positive complexity results on the orientation search have some positive
implications also to the problem of finding functionally analogous genes.

distinct colors. A graph is $s$-chromatic if it is colorable in $s$ colors and
any coloring of it uses at least $s$ colors. The forcing chromatic number
$F(G)$ of an $s$-chromatic graph $G$ is the smallest number of vertices which
must be colored so that, with the restriction that $s$ colors are used, every
remaining vertex has its color determined uniquely. We estimate the
computational complexity of $F(G)$ relating it to the complexity class US
introduced by Blass and Gurevich. We prove that recognizing if $F(G)\le 2$ is
US-hard with respect to polynomial-time many-one reductions. Moreover, this
problem is coNP-hard even under the promises that $F(G)\le 3$ and $G$ is
3-chromatic. On the other hand, recognizing if $F(G)\le k$, for each constant

the framework of covariant open bosonic string field theory. We show that if an
open string field is expressed as a certain local function on spacetime--in
particular, a function of the lightcone component of the midpoint and the
transverse center of mass degrees of freedom--that cubic string field theory is
nonsingular and local in lightcone time. In particular, the theory has a well
defined initial value formulation resembling that of an ordinary second order
relativistic field theory in lightcone frame. This description can be achieved
by a nonsingular unitary transformation on the Fock space, and we demonstrate
explicitly that the theory is gauge invariant and the interaction vertex is
local in this basis. With an initial value formulation at hand, we are able to
construct an explicit second quantized operator formalism for the theory using
the Hamiltonian BRST formalism. We also explore issues of causality by
considering a singular limit of the theory where all spacetime coordinates are
taken to the midpoint. At any stage in this limit, the theory is well-defined
and arbitrarily close to being completely local and manifestly causal. We argue
that the this limit must account for the macroscopic causality of the string
S-matrix.

technique is used, in combination with contour integral representations. The
surface energies on the branes are presented in the form of the sums of single
brane and second brane-induced parts. For the geometry of a single brane both
regions, on the left (L-region) and on the right (R-region), of the brane are
considered. The surface densities for separate L- and R-regions contain pole
and finite contributions. For an infinitely thin brane taking these regions
together, in odd spatial dimensions the pole parts cancel and the total surface
energy is finite. The parts in the surface densities generated by the presence
of the second brane are finite for all nonzero values of the interbrane
separation. It is shown that for large distances between the branes the induced
surface densities give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological
constant on the brane. In the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model, for the
interbrane distances solving the hierarchy problem between the gravitational

  added. A new reference [22] added","J. Korean Math. Soc. 46 (2009), 363--447",,,"math.SG math.DS",,"  The author previously defined the spectral invariants, denoted by
$\rho(H;a)$, of a Hamiltonian function $H$ as the mini-max value of the action
functional $\AA_H$ over the Novikov Floer cycles in the Floer homology class
dual to the quantum cohomology class $a$. The spectrality axiom of the
invariant $\rho(H;a)$ states that the mini-max value is a critical value of the
action functional $\AA_H$. The main purpose of the present paper is to prove
this axiom for {\it nondegenerate} Hamiltonian functions in {\it irrational}
symplectic manifolds $(M,\omega)$. We also prove that the spectral invariant
function $\rho_a: H \mapsto \rho(H;a)$ can be pushed down to a {\it continuous}
function defined on the universal ({\it \'etale}) covering space
$\widetilde{Ham}(M,\omega)$ of the group $Ham(M,\omega)$ of Hamiltonian
diffeomorphisms on general $(M,\omega)$. For a certain generic homotopy, which
we call a {\it Cerf homotopy} $\HH = \{H^s\}_{0 \leq s\leq 1}$ of Hamiltonians,
the function $\rho_a \circ \HH: s \mapsto \rho(H^s;a)$ is piecewise smooth away
from a countable subset of $[0,1]$ for each non-zero quantum cohomology class
$a$.
  The proof of this nondegenerate spectrality relies on several new ingredients
in the chain level Floer theory, which have their own independent interest: a
structure theorem on the Cerf bifurcation diagram of the critical values of the
action functionals associated to a generic one-parameter family of Hamiltonian
functions, a general structure theorem and the handle sliding lemma of Novikov
Floer cycles over such a family and a {\it family version} of new
transversality statements involving the Floer chain map, and many others. We
call this chain level Floer theory as a whole the {\it Floer mini-max theory}.

use of training samples (subsets of the data), so as to allow utilization of
improper objective priors. The most common prescription for choosing training
samples is to choose them to be as small as possible, subject to yielding
proper posteriors; these are called minimal training samples.
  When data can vary widely in terms of either information content or impact on
the improper priors, use of minimal training samples can be inadequate.
  Important examples include certain cases of discrete data, the presence of
censored observations, and certain situations involving linear models and
explanatory variables. Such situations require more sophisticated methods of
choosing training samples. A variety of such methods are developed in this
paper, and successfully applied in challenging situations.

large and grow with the sample size. In this paper some asymptotic properties
of the nonconcave penalized likelihood are established for situations in which

effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for
individual steps in these signaling networks, many of the parameters required
to describe the behavior of these systems remain unknown, or at best,
estimates. With these goals and caveats in mind, we use methods of statistical
mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling
networks. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our
methods towards modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation
of neuronal cells. Using our approach, we are able to extract predictions that
are highly specific and accurate, thereby enabling us to predict the influence
of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response
to the two growth factors. We show that extracting biologically relevant
predictions from complex signaling models appears to be possible even in the
absence of measurements of all the individual rate constants. Our methods also
raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of
cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems wherein
particular ''soft'' combinations of parameters can be varied over wide ranges
without impacting the final output and demonstrating that a few ''stiff''
parameter combinations center around the paramount regulatory steps of the
network. We refer to this property -- which is distinct from robustness -- as
''sloppiness.''
