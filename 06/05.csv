large amplitude, irregularly pulsating stars R UMi, RS Cyg, V CVn, UX Dra and
SX Her is presented. First, multi-periodicity is eliminated for these
pulsations, i.e. they are not caused by the excitation of a small number of
pulsation modes with constant amplitudes. Next, on the basis of energetics we
also eliminate stochasticity as a cause, leaving low dimensional chaos as the
only alternative. We then use a global flow reconstruction technique in an
attempt to extract quantitative information from the light curves, and to
uncover common physical features in this class of irregular variable stars that
straddle the RV Tau to the Mira variables. Evidence is presented that the
pulsational behavior of R UMi, RS Cyg, V CVn and UX Dra takes place in a
4-dimensional dynamical phase space, suggesting that two vibrational modes are
involved in the pulsation. A linear stability analysis of the fixed points of
the maps further indicates the existence of a two-mode resonance, similar to
the one we had uncovered earlier in R Sct: The irregular pulsations are the
result of a continual energy exchange between two strongly nonadiabatic modes,
a lower frequency pulsation mode and an overtone that are in a close 2:1
resonance. The evidence is particularly convincing for R UMi, RS Cyg and V CVn,
but much weaker for UX Dra. In contrast, the pulsations of SX Her appear to be
more complex and may require a 6D space.

stars have shown that their winds have a very simple, power law structure when
averaged over the pulsation cycle. This structure is stable and robust despite
the pulsational wave disturbances, and appears to be strongly self-regulated.
Observational studies support these conclusions. The models also show that
dust-free winds are nearly adiabatic, with little heating or cooling. The
classical, steady, adiabatic wind solution to the hydrodynamic equations fails
to account for an extensive region of nearly constant outflow velocity. We
investigate analytic solutions which include the effects of wave pressure,
heating, and the resulting entropy changes. Wave pressure is represented by a
term like that in the Reynolds turbulence equation for the mean velocity.
Although the pressure from individual waves is modest, the waves are likely the
primary agent of self-regulation of dust-free winds. In models of dusty winds,
the gas variables also adopt a power law dependence on radius. Heating is
required at all radii to maintain this flow, and grain heating and heat
transfer to the gas are significant. Both hydrodynamic and gas/grain thermal
feedbacks transform the flow towards self-regulated forms. (Abridged)

brightness H II surface located at the faces of the molecular clouds directly
exposed to the ionizing radiation of the central SOBA; and a low-excitation,
low-surface brightness halo that extends to much larger distances from the
ionizing stars. The cavities created by the winds and SN explosions are filled
with X-ray-emitting coronal gas. The nebular lines emitted by the warm gas
experience a variable attenuation as a consequence of the dust distribution,
which is patchy in the plane of the sky and with clouds interspersed among
emission-line sources in the same line of sight. The optical depth at H alpha
as measured from the ratio of the thermal radio continuum to H alpha shows a
very good correlation with the total CO (1-0) column, indicating that most of
the dust resides in the cold molecular phase. The optical depth at H alpha as
measured from the ratio of H alpha to H beta also correlates with the CO
emission but not as strongly as in the previous case. We analyze the difference
between those two measurements and we find that <=11% of the H II gas is hidden
behind large-optical-depth molecular clouds. We detect two candidate compact H
II regions embedded inside the molecular cloud; both are within short distance
of WR/Of stars and one of them is located within 16 pc of a RSG. We estimate

landmark in the history of the universe, but the processes through which it
occurs remain mysterious. In particular, recent numerical and analytic work
suggest that reionization by stellar sources is driven by large-scale density
fluctuations and must be inhomogeneous on scales of many comoving Mpc. We
examine the prospects for constraining the topology of neutral and ionized gas
through Lyman-alpha absorption of high-redshift sources. One method is to
search for gaps in the Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs of luminous sources.
These could occur if the line of sight passes sufficiently close to the center
of a large HII region. In contrast to previous work, we find a non-negligible
(though still small) probability of observing such a gap before reionization is
complete. In our model the transmission spike at z=6.08 in the spectrum of SDSS
J1148+5251 does not necessarily require overlap to have been completed at an
earlier epoch. We also examine the IGM damping wing absorption of the
Lyman-alpha emission lines of star-forming galaxies. Because most galaxies sit
inside of large HII regions, we find that the severity of absorption is
significantly smaller than previously thought and decoupled from the properties
of the observed galaxy. While this limits our ability to constrain the mean
neutral fraction of the IGM from observations of individual galaxies, it
presents the exciting possibility of measuring the size distribution and
evolution of the ionized bubbles by examining the distribution of damping wing
optical depths in a large sample of galaxies.

  physics/0406020",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  Some recent philosophical debate about persistence has focussed on an
argument against perdurantism that discusses rotating perfectly homogeneous
discs (the `rotating discs argument'; RDA). The argument has been mostly
discussed by metaphysicians, though it appeals to ideas from classical
mechanics, especially about rotation. In contrast, I assess the RDA from the
perspective of the philosophy of physics.
  After introducing the argument and emphasizing the relevance of physics
(Sections 1 to 3), I review some metaphysicians' replies to the argument
(Section 4). Thereafter, I argue for three main conclusions. They all arise
from the fact, emphasized in Section 2, that classical mechanics
(non-relativistic as well as relativistic) is both more subtle, and more
problematic, than philosophers generally realize.
  The main conclusion is that the RDA can be defeated (Section 6 onwards).
Namely, by the perdurantist taking objects in classical mechanics (whether
point-particles or continuous bodies) to have only temporally extended, i.e.
non-instantaneous, temporal parts: which immediately blocks the RDA.
Admittedly, this version of perdurantism defines persistence in a weaker sense
of `definition' than {\em pointilliste} versions that aim to define persistence
assuming only instantaneous temporal parts. But I argue that temporally
extended temporal parts are supported by both classical and quantum mechanics.

  Coulomb potential","Revtex4, 7 pages, 0 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.71.012105",,"quant-ph",,"  We obtain exact solutions to the Dirac equation and the relevant binding
energies in the combined Aharonov--Bohm--Coulomb potential in 2+1 dimensions.
By means of solutions obtained the quantum Aharonov--Bohm effect is studied for
free and bound electron states. We show that the total scattering amplitude in
the combined Aharonov--Bohm--Coulomb potential is a sum of the Aharonov--Bohm
and the Coulomb scattering amplitudes. This modifies expression for the
standard Aharonov--Bohm cross section due to the interference these two
amplitudes with each other.

  Source","9 pages, 5 figures","New Journal of Physics 6, 86 (2004)","10.1088/1367-2630/6/1/086",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the photon statistics of a single-photon source that operates
under non-stationary conditions. The photons are emitted by shining a periodic
sequence of laser pulses on single atoms falling randomly through a
high-finesse optical cavity. Strong antibunching is found in the intensity
correlation of the emitted light, demonstrating that a single atom emits
photons one-by-one. However, the number of atoms interacting with the cavity
follows a Poissonian statistics so that, on average, no sub-Poissonian photon
statistics is obtained, unless the measurement is conditioned on the presence
of single atoms.

Lett., 94:053604, 2005","10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.053604",,"quant-ph",,"  The photon statistics of the light emitted from an atomic ensemble into a
single field mode of an optical cavity is investigated as a function of the
number of atoms. The light is produced in a Raman transition driven by a pump
laser and the cavity vacuum [M.Hennrich et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4672
(2000)], and a recycling laser is employed to repeat this process continuously.
  For weak driving, a smooth transition from antibunching to bunching is found
for about one intra-cavity atom. Remarkably, the bunching peak develops within
the antibunching dip. For saturated driving and a growing number of atoms, the
bunching amplitude decreases and the bunching duration increases, indicating
the onset of Raman lasing.
