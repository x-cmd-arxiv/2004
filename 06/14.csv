found the long sought for case of a Ly-alpha emitter seen in the centre of a
broad DLA trough. This is the predicted `textbook case' of an intervening DLA
galaxy if DLA galaxies are small, but would not be expected if intervening high
redshift DLA galaxies have large gaseous disks. The Ly-alpha flux is
5.4{+2}{-0.8} * 1e-17 ergs/s/cm2 similar to what has been found in previously
known high z DLA galaxies. The impact parameter is found to be 0.3+-0.3 arcsec.
This is smaller than what was found in previous cases but still consistent with
random sight-lines through absorbers with mean impact parameter ~1 arcsec. Of
the 24 DLAs targeted in the NICMOS imaging survey five have now been identified
as Ly-alpha emitters. The DLA galaxies with detected Ly-alpha emission tend to
have higher interstellar metallicities than those with undetected Ly-alpha
emission. This is plausibly explained as a consequence of a positive
correlation between the Ly-alpha line luminosities of the galaxies and their
metallicities, although the present sample is too small for a definitive
conclusion. The available observations of high-redshift DLA galaxies are also
consistent with a negative correlation between Ly-alpha equivalent widths and
metallicities, as seen in nearby star-forming galaxies and usually attributed
to the preferential absorption of Ly-alpha photons by dust grains.

subAlfv\'enically from the central gravitating source and its surrounding

magnetocentrifugally and thus cross the appropriate MHD critical points,

the flow confined by the magnetic hoop stress; (b) radially expanding wind-type
outflows analogous to the solar wind, from inefficient magnetic rotators or

studied underpressured outflows, the transition from collimated jets to
uncollimated winds is not continuous in the appropriate parametric space with a
gap where no stationary solution is found. Superfast at infinity solutions are
filtered by three critical surfaces corresponding to the three known limiting
characteristics or separatrices of MHD wind theory. Collimated and terminated
solutions cross the slow, Alfv\'en and fast magneto-acoustic critical points.

model, the deprojected temperature profile is flat in the outer region around
7.6 keV and decreases to $\sim$ 5.6 keV in the center, which may be connected
with the gas cooling. In the central part, a two-component thermal plasma model
can fit the spectrum significantly better. Moreover, the cool component (T
$\sim$ 1.8 keV) has a much lower metal abundance than the hot component (T
$\sim$ 8 keV), which may be due to the longer cooling time for the cool gas
with lower abundance. In addition, it was found that without a main isothermal
component, the standard cooling flow model cannot fit the spectrum
satisfactorily. From the isothermal model fitting results we also derived the
electron density $n_e$, and fitted its radial distribution with a
double-$\beta$ model. The $n_e$ profile inferred with the double-$\beta$ model
and the deprojected X-ray gas temperature profile were then combined to derive
the total mass and the total projected mass of the cluster. The projected mass
is lower than that derived from the weak lensing method. However, assuming that
the cluster extends to a larger radius $\sim15'$ as found by Clowe & Schneider
(2002), the two results are consistent within the error bars. Furthermore, we
calculated the projected mass within the radius of $\sim$ 153 kpc implied by
the presence of a gravitational lensing arc, which is about half of the mass

underlying electronic structure of LSMO thin films. The peak nearest to $E_F$
due to the $e_g$ orbital is also found to move toward $E_F$ in a rigid-band
manner, while the peak intensity decreases with increasing $x$. The loss of
spectral weight with $x$ in the occupied density of states was compensated by
simultaneous increment of the shoulder structure in O 1$s$ XAS spectra,
suggesting the existence of a pseudogap, that is depression in spectral weight
at $E_F$, for all metallic compositions. These results indicate that the simple
rigid-band model does not describe the electronic structure near $E_F$ of LSMO

dust matter theory, when the charge of each particle is equal to its mass.
Solutions for this system are less difficult to find, in general one does not
need even to impose any spatial symmetry a priori. For instance, any number of
extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solutions (which in vacuum reduce to extreme
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes) located at will is a solution. In matter one
can also find solutions with some ease. Here we find an exact solution of the
Majumdar-Papapetrou system, a spherically symmetric charged thick shell, with
mass m, outer radius r_o, and inner radius r_i. This solution consists of three
regions, an inner Minkowski region, a middle region with extreme charged dust
matter, and an outer Reissner-Nordstrom region. The matching of the regions,
obeying the usual junction conditions for boundary surfaces, is continuous. For
vanishing inner radius, one obtains a Bonnor star, whereas for vanishing
thickness, one obtains an infinitesimally thin shell. For sufficiently high
mass of the thick shell or sufficiently small outer radius, it forms an extreme
Reissner-Nordstrom quasi-black hole, i.e., a star whose gravitational
properties are virtually indistinguishable from a true extreme black hole. This
quasi-black hole has no hair and has a naked horizon, meaning that the Riemann
tensor at the horizon on an infalling probe diverges. At the critical value,
when the mass is equal to the outer radius, m=r_o, there is no smooth manifold.
Above the critical value when m>r_o there is no solution, the shell collapses
into a singularity. Systems with m< r_o are neutrally stable. Many of these
properties are similar to those of gravitational monopoles.

efficiently. Reductions of the xncKP hierarchy are treated, in particular to
the extended ncKdV and ncBoussinesq hierarchies. Furthermore, a good part of
the Sato formalism for the KP hierarchy is carried over to the generalized
framework. In particular, the well-known bilinear identity theorem for the KP
hierarchy, expressed in terms of the (formal) Baker-Akhiezer function, extends
to the xncKP hierarchy. Moreover, it is demonstrated that N-soliton solutions
of the ncKP equation are also solutions of the first few deformation equations.
This is shown to be related to the existence of certain families of algebraic
identities.

the spacetime background is $(4+n)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. We
compute the low-energy absorption cross sections for the brane-localized
massive scalar, brane-localized massive Dirac fermion, and massive bulk scalar.
For the case of brane-localized massive Dirac fermion we introduce the
particle's spin in the traditional Dirac form without invoking the
Newman-Penrose method. Our direct introduction of spin enables us to compute
contributions to the $j$th-level partial absorption cross section from orbital
angular momenta $\ell = j \pm 1/2$. It is shown that the contribution from the
low $\ell$-level is larger than that from the high $\ell$-level in the massive
case. In the massless case these two contributions are exactly same with each
other. The ratio of low-energy absorption cross sections for Dirac fermion and
for scalar is dependent on the number of extra dimensions as $2^{(n-3)/
(n+1)}$. Thus the ratio factor 1/8 is recovered when $n=0$, which Unruh found.
The physical importance of this ratio factor is discussed in the context of the
brane-world scenario. For the case of bulk scalar our low-energy absorption
cross section for S-wave is exactly same with area of the horizon hypersurface
in the massless limt, which is an higher-dimensional generaliztion of
universality. Our results for all cases turn out to have correct massless and
4d limits.

the brane-antibrane system, are unstable to decay. This instability is
described by the appearance of a tachyonic mode in the spectrum of open strings
ending on the brane(s). The decay of these unstable systems is described by the
rolling of the tachyon field from the unstable maximum to the minimum of its
potential. We analytically study the dynamics of the inhomogeneous tachyon
field as it rolls towards the true vacuum of the theory in the context of
several different tachyon effective actions. We find that the vacuum dynamics
of these theories is remarkably similar and in particular we show that in all
cases the tachyon field forms caustics where second and higher derivatives of
the field blow up. The formation of caustics signals a pathology in the
evolution since each of the effective actions considered is not reliable in the
vicinity of a caustic. We speculate that the formation of caustics is an
artifact of truncating the tachyon action, which should contain all orders of
derivatives acting on the field, to a finite number of derivatives. Finally, we
consider inhomogeneous solutions in p-adic string theory, a toy model of the
bosonic tachyon which contains derivatives of all orders acting on the field.
For a large class of initial conditions we conclusively show that the evolution
is well behaved in this case. It is unclear if these caustics are a genuine
prediction of string theory or not.

acts on this triple via forms of the isomorphisms R introduced by the author
and Ping Xu. We then consider the three duals of a general triple vector bundle
and show that the corresponding group is neither the dihedral group of the

external quasiperiodic forcing. We consider the structure of a vicinity of a
smooth attracting invariant curve (torus) in the quasiperiodically forced Henon
map and characterize it in terms of Lyapunov vectors, which determine
directions of contraction for an element of phase space in a vicinity of the
torus. When the dependence of the Lyapunov vectors upon the angle variable on
the torus is smooth, regular torus-doubling bifurcation takes place. On the
other hand, the onset of non-smooth dependence leads to a new phenomenon
terminating the torus-doubling bifurcation line in the parameter space with the
torus transforming directly into a strange nonchaotic attractor. We argue that
the new phenomenon plays a key role in mechanisms of transition to chaos in
quasiperiodically forced invertible dynamical systems.

describing ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows of general type (i.e., with

only to describe the general type flows in terms of single-valued functions,
but also to solve the intriguing problem of the ``missing'' MHD integrals of
motion. The set of hitherto known MHD local invariants and integrals of motion
appears to be incomplete: for the vanishing magnetic field it does not reduce
to the set of the conventional hydrodynamic invariants. And if the MHD analogs
of the vorticity and helicity were discussed earlier for the particular cases,
the analog of Ertel invariant has been so far unknown. It is found that on the
basis of the new invariants introduced a wide set of high-order invariants can
be constructed. The new invariants are relevant both for the deeper insight
into the problem of the topological structure of the MHD flows as a whole and
for the examination of the stability problems. The additional advantage of the
proposed approach is that it enables one to deal with discontinuous flows,
including all types of possible breaks.

we employ a complex continuous wavelet transform to determine the instantaneous

operator rho = I/2. To improve the reconstruction procedure one has to send via
the channel more states. The best strategy is to complement the total mixture
with pure states that are mutually orthogonal in the sense of the Bloch-sphere
