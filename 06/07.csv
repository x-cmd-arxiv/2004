"astro-ph/0406142","Igor Pasha I.","I.I. Pasha","Density-Wave Spiral Theories in the 1960s. I","50 pages, 11 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  With the arrival of computers, plasma physics and several fresh investigators
by the early 1960s, understanding the spiral structure of galaxies entered a
new stage of unusually vigorous activity broadly grouped under the umbrella
marked ""density-wave theory"". Paper I starts with acknowledging B. Lindblad,
rightly regarded the main father of this whole subject, and then describes the
early contributions by Lynden-Bell, Toomre, Hunter and Kalnajs, who had
formulated and applied such notions as the stability of flat galaxies, the
regenerative spiral phenomenon, the shearing density waves and the global
spiral modes. But the foremost enthusiast and proponent of the density-wave
picture was undoubtedly C.C. Lin whose 1964 and 1966 papers with Shu, written
in support of his working hypothesis of the quasi-stationary wave-mode spiral
structure, had a big and immediate impact upon astronomers, at least as a
welcome sign that genuine understanding of the spiral phenomenon seemed in some
sense to be just around the corner.
  We find that even Lin occasionally let himself get carried away with too much
enthusiasm as for instance when he wrote that his relatively exploratory work
with Shu had already led to a ""theory free from the kinematical difficulty of
differential rotation"", or that it ""enables us to provide a mechanism to
explain the existence of a spiral pattern over the whole disk while allowing
the individual spiral arms to be broken and fragmentary"" (Lin 1967b, p.462).
Already at the time such optimism was not entirely shared by other experts, and
by the late 1960s - as we shall see in Paper II - it had become very clear to
everyone that much hard work still remained to explain even the persistence,
much less the dynamical origins, of the variety of spirals that we observe.

"astro-ph/0406143","Igor Pasha I.","I.I. Pasha","Density-Wave Spiral Theories in the 1960s. II","65 pages, 15 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  By the 1970s the spiral subject was in considerable disarray. The
semiempirical theory by Lin and Shu was confronted with serious problems. They
were put on the defensive over their tightly wrapped steady modes on two
principal fronts: from the radial propagation at the group velocity that would
tend to wind them almost at the material rate, and from the tendencies of
galaxy disks toward a strong global instability that appeared likely to
overwhelm them. Of course, one might claim that such threats were imaginary and
only of academic interest, on the ground that nature itself had overcome them.
One might also be confident that the QSSS hypothesis must be correct as
illuminated by the everlasting truth of Hubble's classification. One might even
take pride in the fact that a very promising concept developed, although not
connected to the wave steadiness, on spiral shocks in interstellar gas and
their induced star formation. But such a heuristic approach did not stimulate
very strong progress in understanding dynamical principles of the spiral
phenomenon; moreover, it often misled, and a rich irony was already that the
supposed QSSS favorites M51 and M81 turned out most probably not to be
quasi-steady at all. A further irony was the continuing failure of Lin and Shu
to account the trailing character of their 'modes', while that was already
grasped by their direct 'deductive' opponents. But the greatest irony lay in
the fact that the concept later known as swing amplification, worked out by the
mid-1960s, was originally denigrated by Lin's camp as relating exclusively to
'material arms', whereas it turned out in the end to be of vital importance to
this entire spiral enterprise including the variants of chaotic ragged
patterns, tidal transient grand designs and growing or quasi-steady modes.

synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistically moving electron--positron
jets carrying large-scale helical magnetic fields. In our model, the jet is
cylindrical, and the emitting plasma moves parallel to the jet axis with a
characteristic Lorentz factor $\Gamma$. We draw attention to the strong
influence that the bulk relativistic motion of the emitting relativistic
particles has on the observed polarization.
  We conclude that large-scale magnetic fields can explain the salient
polarization properties of parsec-scale AGN jets. Since the typical degrees of
polarization are $\leq 15%$, the emitting parts of the jets must have
comparable rest-frame toroidal and poloidal fields. In this case, most
relativistic jets are strongly dominated by the toroidal magnetic field
component in the observer's frame, $B_\phi/B_z \sim \Gamma$. We also discuss
the possibility that relativistic AGN jets may be electromagnetically (Poynting
flux) dominated. In this case, dissipation of the toroidal magnetic field (and
not fluid shocks) may be responsible for particle acceleration.

targets. Red giant candidates were targeted in a small field on M31's giant
southern tidal stream at a projected distance of 31kpc from the galaxy center.
We isolate a clean sample of 68 giants by removing contaminants (foreground
Galactic dwarfs and background galaxies) using spectroscopic, imaging, and
photometric methods. About 65% of the M31 stars are found to be members of the
stream, while the rest appear to be members of the general halo population. The
mean (heliocentric) radial velocity of the stream in our field is -458 km/s, or
-158 km/s relative to M31's systemic velocity, in good agreement with recent
measurements at other stream locations. The intrinsic velocity dispersion of
the stream is constrained to be 15_{-15}^{+8} km/s (90% confidence limits). The
companion paper by Font et al. (2004, astro-ph/0406146) discusses possible
orbits, implications of the coldness of the stream, and progenitor satellite
properties. The kinematics (and perhaps [Fe/H] distribution) of our halo sample
indicate that it is different from other M31 halo samples; this may be an
indication of substructure in the halo. The stream seems to have a higher mean
[Fe/H] than the halo, -0.51 vs -0.74 dex, and a smaller [Fe/H] spread. The
stream's high metallicity implies that its progenitor must have been a luminous
dwarf galaxy. The CaII triplet strengths of the M31 giants are generally
consistent with photometric estimates of their metallicity (derived by fitting
RGB fiducials in the color-magnitude diagram). There is indirect evidence of
intermediate-age stars in the stream.

We find that the observations are best fit by orbits that are highly eccentric
and close to edge-on, with apo- to peri-center ratios of order 25 - 30, and
with apocenters at or only slightly beyond the southern edge of the current
data. Among these orbits, we are able to find a few that plausibly connect the
stream with the northern spur or with the low-surface-brightness feature of
similar high metallicity as the stream (originally reported by Ferguson et al.
2002) to the east of M31's center. In the latter case, if the connection is
real, then the eastern debris should lie well in front of M31 near the
apocenter of the orbit. Both the width of the debris and velocity dispersion
measurements imply a rough lower limit on the mass of the progenitor of 10^8
M_sun. We use this limit and our orbits to discuss which of M31's satellites
could be plausibly associated with the stream. In addition, we predict that the
width of the stream should increase beyond the southern edge of the current
data around the apocenter of the orbit and that the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion should exhibit significant variations along the stream.

intrinsic source spectra by correcting the line of sight extinction via the
optical depth spectrum of a late type star that is most likely not affected by
local dust emission or extinction at the Galactic Center. The good agreement
between the two approaches shows that the overall variation of the
line-of-sight extinction across the central 0.5 pc is $\Delta

interprete both facts as evidence that a significant amount of the absorption

considered separately. We use the mass profile we determined from the

excluding the brightest ones, and S0s) outside substructures; the latter were
assumed to be on isotropic orbits, which is supported by the shape of their
velocity distribution. The projected distribution and kinematics of the
galaxies of other types are used to search for equilibrium solutions in the
gravitational potential derived from the early-type galaxies, using the method
described by Binney and Mamon as implemented by Solanes and Salvador-Sole'. For
the brightest ellipticals we are not able to construct equilibrium solutions.
This is most likely the result of the formation history and the special
location of these galaxies at the centres of their clusters. The data for the
early spirals allow equilibrium solutions and are consistent with isotropic
orbits, although there is an apparent radial anisotropy at about 0.45 r200. For
the late spirals an equilibrium solution with isotropic orbits is rejected by
the data. The orbits are nearly isotropic within about 0.7 r200, but then
become increasingly radial outwards. Finally, the data for the galaxies in
substructures indicate that isotropic solutions are not acceptable, and
tangential orbits are indicated. We briefly discuss the possible implications
of these velocity-anisotropy profiles for current ideas of the evolution and
transformation of galaxies in clusters. (Abridged)

luminosity density (LD) in the UV, B, J, and K bands, and the stellar mass
density (MD) of galaxies in two reference models of galaxy evolution: the pure
luminosity evolution (PLE) model developed by Calura & Matteucci (2003) and the
semi-analytical model (SAM) of hierarchical galaxy formation by Menci et al.
(2002). The former includes a detailed description of the chemical evolution of
galaxies of different morphological types with no density evolution; the latter
includes the merging histories of the galactic DM haloes, as predicted by the
hierarchical clustering scenario, but it does not contain morphological
classification nor chemical evolution. We find that at z< 1.5 both models are
consistent with the available data on the LD of galaxies in all the considered
bands. At high z, the LDs predicted in the PLE model show a peak due to the
formation of ellipticals, whereas the SAM predicts a gradual decrease of the
star formation and of the LD for z> 2.5. At such redshifts the PLE predictions
tend to overestimate the present data in the B band whereas the SAM tends to
underestimate the observed UV LD. As for the stellar MD, the PLE picture
predicts that nearly 50% and 85% of the present stellar mass are in place at
z=4 and z=1, respectively. According to the SAM, 50% and 60% of the present
stellar mass are in place at z=1.2 and z=1, respectively. Both predictions fit
the observed MD up to z=1. At z>1, the PLE model and the SAM tend to
overestimate and underestimate the observed values, respectively. We discuss
the origin of the above model results, and the role of observational
uncertainties (such as dust extinction) in comparing models with observations.

unbiased sample of 9 luminous, dusty galaxies selected at 1200um by the MAMBO
camera on the IRAM 30-m telescope, a population akin to the well-known submm or
`SCUBA' galaxies (hereafter SMGs). Owing to the coarse resolution of submm/mm
instrumentation, SMGs have traditionally been difficult to identify at other
wavelengths. We compare our multi-wavelength catalogs to show that the overlap
between 24 and 1200um must be close to complete at these flux levels. We find
that all (4/4) of the most secure >=4sigma SMGs have robust >=4sigma
counterparts at 1.4GHz, while the fraction drops to 7/9 using all >=3sigma
SMGs. We show that combining mid-IR and marginal (>=3sigma) radio detections
provides plausible identifications in the remaining cases, enabling us to
identify the complete sample. Accretion onto an obscured central engine is
betrayed by the shape of the mid-IR continuum emission for several sources,
confirming Spitzer's potential to weed out active galaxies. We demonstrate the
power of a S(24um)/S(8um) vs S(8um)/S(4.5um) color-color plot as a diagnostic
for this purpose. However, we conclude that the majority (~75%) of SMGs have
rest-frame mid-/far-IR SEDs commensurate with obscured starbursts. Sensitive
24-um observations are clearly a useful route to identify and characterize
reliable counterparts to high-redshift far-IR-bright galaxies, complementing

G-band bright points are flanked by dark lanes. The increased brightness in

higher. At a given geometric height, the magnetic elements are cooler than the
surrounding medium. In the G-band, the contrast is further increased by the
destruction of CH in the low density magnetic elements. The optical depth unity
surface is very corrugated. Bright granules have their continuum optical depth
unity 80 km above the mean surface, the magnetic elements 200-300 km below. The
horizontal temperature gradient is especially large next to flux

surface is hidden by the granules and the bright points are no longer visible,

of verifying the morphology of the standard model. Much work has already been
done on the statistical properties of light curves monitored in one colour, and
it is now possible to use these observations to test predictions of theoretical
models. The addition of a second colour can add enormously to the power of such
tests, and put tight constraints on the nature of the variations. In this paper
a yearly monitoring programme of several hundred quasars in blue and red
passbands covering 21 years is presented. The statistics of colour changes are
examined for a 15 year period of homogeneous data with Fourier power spectrum
analysis, in a form suitable for testing against theoretical predictions. The
results of the Fourier analysis show that there is more power in blue light on
all timescales than in the red. Examination of the light curves shows several
different modes of colour change. However, if allowance is made for the effects
of the underlying host galaxy, the variations become close to achromatie. There
are however structural differences between red and blue light curves which
cannot be accounted for in this way, and various modes of variability including
disc instability and microlensing are examined to provide explanations for
these features.

years. Among the emission line galaxies was the expected population of Seyfert
2 galaxies with only narrow forbidden lines in emission, and no broad lines.
However, from the long term monitoring programme it was clear that some 10% of
these were strongly variable with strong continuum emission. It is argued that
these objects can only be Seyfert 1 galaxies in which the nucleus is viewed
directly, but in which broad emission lines are completely absent. We compare
these observations with other cases from the literature where the broad line
region is reported to be weak or variable, and investigate the possibility that
the absence of the broad line component is due to reddening. We conclude that
this does not account for the observations, and that in these AGN the broad
line region is absent. We also tentatively identify more luminous quasars from
our sample where the broad emission lines also appear to be absent. The
consequences of this for AGN models are discussed, and a case is made that we
are seeing AGN in a transition stage between the fuel supply from a surrounding

1 Msun, assuming four different constant accretion rates (2, 3, 5 and 10
times10^{-7} Msun/yr). In a one-dimensional approximation, we compute the mass
accretion and subsequent nuclear fusion of helium into carbon and oxygen, as
well as angular momentum accretion, angular momentum transport inside the white
dwarf, and rotationally induced chemical mixing. Our models show two major
effects of rotation: a) The helium burning nuclear shell source in the rotating
models is much more stable than in corresponding non-rotating models -- which
increases the likelihood of accreting white dwarfs to reach the stage of
central carbon ignition. This effect is mainly due to rotationally induced
mixing at the CO/He interface which widens the shell source, and due to the
centrifugal force lowering the density and degeneracy at the shell source
location. b) The C/O-ratio in the layers which experience helium shell burning
-- which may affect the energy of a SN Ia explosion -- is strongly decreased by
the rotationally induced mixing of alpha-particles into the carbon-rich layers.
We discuss implications of our results for the evolution of SNe Ia progenitors.

initial state with all the energy in the zero mode. For new inflation it allows
a consistent treatment of the explosive particle production due to spinodal
instabilities. Quantum field inflation (under conditions that are the quantum
analog of slow roll) leads, upon evolution, to the formation of a condensate
starting a regime of effective classical inflation. We compute the primordial
perturbations taking the dominant quantum effects into account. The results for
the scalar, vector and tensor primordial perturbations are expressed in terms
of the classical inflation results. For a N-component field in a O(N) symmetric
model, adiabatic fluctuations dominate while isocurvature or entropy
fluctuations are negligible. The results agree with the current WMAP
observations and predict corrections to the power spectrum in classical
inflation.Such corrections are estimated to be of the order of m^2/[N H^2]
where m is the inflaton mass and H the Hubble constant at horizon crossing.
This turns to be about 4% for the cosmologically relevant scales. This quantum
field treatment of inflation provides the foundations to the classical
inflation and permits to compute quantum corrections to it.

  Computing, pp. 2-9, 2004",,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cs.NI",,"  We introduce a scalable searching algorithm for finding nodes and contents in
random networks with Power-Law (PL) and heavy-tailed degree distributions. The
network is searched using a probabilistic broadcast algorithm, where a query
message is relayed on each edge with probability just above the bond
percolation threshold of the network. We show that if each node caches its
directory via a short random walk, then the total number of {\em accessible
contents exhibits a first-order phase transition}, ensuring very high hit rates
just above the percolation threshold. In any random PL network of size, $N$,
and exponent, $2 \leq \tau < 3$, the total traffic per query scales
sub-linearly, while the search time scales as $O(\log N)$. In a PL network with
exponent, $\tau \approx 2$, {\em any content or node} can be located in the
network with {\em probability approaching one} in time $O(\log N)$, while
generating traffic that scales as $O(\log^2 N)$, if the maximum degree,
$k_{max}$, is unconstrained, and as $O(N^{{1/2}+\epsilon})$ (for any
$\epsilon>0$) if $ k_{max}=O(\sqrt{N})$. Extensive large-scale simulations show
these scaling laws to be precise. We discuss how this percolation search
algorithm can be directly adapted to solve the well-known scaling problem in
unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Simulations of the protocol on sample
large-scale subnetworks of existing P2P services show that overall traffic can
be reduced by almost two-orders of magnitude, without any significant loss in

presents a technique for the optimization of bound queries over disjunctive
deductive databases with constraints. The proposed approach is an extension of
the well-known Magic-Set technique and is well-suited for being integrated in
current bottom-up (stable) model inference engines. More specifically, it is
based on the exploitation of binding propagation techniques which reduce the
size of the data relevant to answer the query and, consequently, reduces both
the complexity of computing a single model and the number of models to be
considered. The motivation of this work stems from the observation that
traditional binding propagation optimization techniques for bottom-up model
generator systems, simulating the goal driven evaluation of top-down engines,
are only suitable for positive (disjunctive) queries, while hard problems are
expressed using unstratified negation. The main contribution of the paper
consists in the extension of a previous technique, defined for positive
disjunctive queries, to queries containing both disjunctive heads and
constraints (a simple and expressive form of unstratified negation). As the
usual way of expressing declaratively hard problems is based on the
guess-and-check technique, where the guess part is expressed by means of
disjunctive rules and the check part is expressed by means of constraints, the
technique proposed here is highly relevant for the optimization of queries

is investigated using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. The Langevin-type
equation of motion is obtained which has a memory term and both additive and
multiplicative noise terms. The dissipation rate of the oscillating scalar
field is calculated for various interactions such as Yukawa coupling,
three-body scalar interaction, and biquadratic interaction. When the background
temperature is larger than the oscillation frequency, the dissipation rate
arising from the interactions with fermions is suppressed due to the Pauli
blocking, while it is enhanced for interactions with bosons due to the induced
effect. In both cases, we find that the microphysical detailed balance relation
drives the oscillating field to a thermal equilibrium state. That is, for
low-momentum modes, the classical fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds and
they relax to a state the equipartition law is satisfied, while higher-momentum
modes reach the state the number density of each quanta consists of the thermal
boson distribution function and zero-point vacuum contribution. The
temperature-dependent dissipation rates obtained here are applied to the late
reheating phase of inflationary universe. It is found that in some cases the
reheat temperature may take somewhat different value from the conventional
estimates, and in an extreme case the inflaton can dissipate its energy without
linear interactions that leads to its decay. Furthermore the evaporation rate
of the Affleck-Dine field at the onset of its oscillation is calculated.

condition from this set can allow an acceptable b-quark mass within the
constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model. The restrictions on the
parameter space which arise from the cold dark matter, b-->s gamma, muon
anomalous magnetic moment and collider requirements are also investigated. For
mu>0, a wide and natural range of parameters is allowed. On the contrary, the
mu<0 case is excluded by the combination of the cold dark matter and b-->s
gamma requirements. In the mu>0 case, the predicted neutralinos are possibly
detectable in the future direct cold dark matter searches. Moreover, the mu
term is generated via a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. The same model gives rise to a
new shifted inflationary scenario, which is based only on renormalizable terms
and does not suffer from the problem of monopole overproduction at the end of
inflation. Although inflation takes place at large values of the inflaton field
and, thus, supergravity corrections could invalidate it, this does not happen
provided that an extra gauge singlet with a superheavy vacuum expectation value
from D-terms is introduced and a specific Kaehler potential is used.

expressed via elements of mass matrix. The third scheme belongs to the charge
mixings scheme, where mixing parameters are expressed via neutrino weak
charges, as it takes place in the vector dominance model. Using experiments we
must decide which of these schemes is realized indeed. Analysis of the
resonance enhancement mechanism of neutrino oscillations in matter is
performed. It is shown that there are no indications on existence of this
effect. It is shown that the supposition that the neutrinos are Majorana
particles is not confirmed by accelerator experiments. Then only mixings
(oscillations) between Dirac neutrinos with different flavors without sterile
neutrinos can be realized. Using all the present experimental data and the
theoretical results the problem of Sun neutrinos deficit is analyzed. The
conclusion is: the primary Sun $\nu_e$ neutrinos are converted into mixtures of
three types of neutrinos $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$ in approximately equal
quantities.

Thermodynamics and stability of black holes in AdS spaces are quite different

stability of hyperbolic charged black holes with negative constant curvature
horizon in the grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively.
They include hyperbolic Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes in arbitrary
dimensions and hyperbolic black holes in the D=5,4,7 gauged supergravities. It
is found that the associated Gibbs free energies are always negative, which
implies that these black hole solutions are globally stable and black hole
phase is dominant in the grand canonical ensemble, but there is a region in the
phase space where black hole is not locally thermodynamical stable with a
negative heat capacity for a given gauge potential. In the canonical ensemble,
the Helmholtz free energies are not always negative and heat capacities with
fixed electric charge are not always positive, which indicates that the
Hawking-Page phase transition may happen and black holes are not always locally
thermodynamical stable.

We explain this correspondence using the recent results on the equivalence of
the partition function of topological strings and that of four dimensional BPS
black holes, which in turn is holographically dual to the field theory on a
brane. The partition function of the field theory on the brane reduces, for the
ground state sector, to that of 2d Yang-Mills theory. We conjecture that the
large N chiral factorization of the 2d U(N) Yang-Mills partition function
reflects the existence of two boundaries of the classical AdS_2 geometry, with
one chiral sector associated to each boundary; moreover the lack of
factorization at finite N is related to the transformation of the vacuum state
of black hole from a pure state at all orders in 1/N to a state which appears
mixed at finite N (due to O(e^{-N}) effects).

energy density is quite different from {\it either} of these and is close to
the geometric mean of the two: $\rho_{vac}\simeq \sqrt{\rho_{uv} \rho_{ir}}$.
It is argued that classical gravity is actually a probe of the vacuum {\it
fluctuations} of energy density, rather than the energy density itself. While
the globally defined ground state, being an eigenstate of Hamiltonian, will not
have any fluctuations, the ground state energy in the finite region of space
bounded by the cosmic horizon will exhibit fluctuations $\Delta\rho_{\rm
vac}(L_P, L_H)$. When used as a source of gravity, this $\Delta \rho$ should
lead to a spacetime with a horizon size $L_H$. This bootstrapping condition
leads naturally to an effective dark energy density $\Delta\rho\propto
(L_{uv}L_H)^{-2}\propto H^2/G$ which is precisely the observed value. The model
requires, either (i) a stochastic fluctuations of vacuum energy which is
correlated over about a Hubble time or (ii) a semi- anthropic interpretation.

the zero of a `pressure' function. We present an elementary, self-contained
proof which bypasses measure theory and the Thermodynamic Formalism to show
that Bowen's formula holds for $C^1$ conformal repellers. We consider
time-dependent conformal repellers obtained as invariant subsets for sequences
of conformally expanding maps within a suitable class. We show that Bowen's
formula generalizes to such a repeller and that if the sequence is picked at
random then the Hausdorff dimension of the repeller almost surely agrees with
its upper and lower Box dimensions and is given by a natural generalization of
Bowen's formula. For a random uniformly hyperbolic Julia set on the Riemann
sphere we show that if the family of maps and the probability law depend
real-analytically on parameters then so does its almost sure Hausdorff
dimension.

analogues of two different groups of formal power series. The first group is
the set of invertible series with the multiplication, while the second group is
the set of formal diffeomorphisms with the composition. The motivation to
introduce these Hopf algebras comes from the study of formal series with
non-commutative coefficients. Invertible series with non-commutative
coefficients still form a group, and we interpret the corresponding new
non-commutative Hopf algebra as an alternative to the natural Hopf algebra
given by the co-ordinate ring of the group, which has the advantage of being
functorial in the algebra of coefficients. For the formal diffeomorphisms with
non-commutative coefficients, this interpretation fails, because in this case
the composition is not associative anymore. However, we show that for the dual
non-commutative algebra there exists a natural co-associative co-product
defining a non-commutative Hopf algebra. Moreover, we give an explicit formula
for the antipode, which represents a non-commutative version of the Lagrange
inversion formula, and we show that its coefficients are related to planar
binary trees. Then we extend these results to the semi-direct co-product of the
previous Hopf algebras, and to series in several variables. Finally, we show
how the non-commutative Hopf algebras of formal series are related to some
renormalization Hopf algebras, which are combinatorial Hopf algebras motivated
by the renormalization in quantum field theory, and to the renormalization
functor given by the double tensor algebra on a bi-algebra.

treated to all orders for the dipole interaction. The model has been compared
to experimental data for a range of light, neutron-rich psd-shell nuclei. Good
agreement was found for both the inclusive cross sections and momentum
distributions. In the case of $^{17}$C, comparison is also made with the
results of calculations using the transfer-to-the-continuum model. The
calculated 3-dimensional momentum distributions exhibit longitudinal and
transverse momentum components that are strongly coupled by the reaction for
s-wave states, whilst no such effect is apparent for d-waves. Incomplete
detection of transverse momenta arising fromlimited experimental acceptances
thus leads to a narrowing of the longitudinal distributions for nuclei with
significant s-wave valence neutron configurations, as confirmed by the data.
Asymmetries in the longitudinal momentum distributions attributed to
diffractive dissociation are also explored.

$\sim 10$ A$\cdot$GeV; at 40 A$\cdot$GeV it has been recently observed by the
NA49 collaboration. Since hadronic rescattering models predict much larger flow
than observed at this energy we interpret this observation as potential
evidence for a first order phase transition at high baryon density $\rho_B$. A
detailed discussion of the collective flow as a barometer for the equation of
state (EoS) of hot dense matter at RHIC follows. Additionally, detailed
transport studies show that the away-side jet suppression can only partially
($<$ 50%) be due to hadronic rescattering. We, finally, propose upgrades and
second generation experiments at RHIC which inspect the first order phase
transition in the fragmentation region, i.e. at $\mu_B \approx 400$ MeV ($y
\approx 4-5$), where the collapse of the proton flow should be seen in analogy
to the 40 A$\cdot$GeV data. The study of Jet-Wake-riding potentials and Bow
shocks -- caused by jets in the QGP formed at RHIC -- can give further

the paper allows physical predictions to be made. A mechanism is proposed for

perihelium advance. It is then argued that testing gravity in the physical

new equation, with consideration of the test particle's inertial mass, produces
an exponential refractive index where the Newtonian potential appears in

learning to predict gene regulatory response. Our approach is motivated by the
hypothesis that in simple organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can
learn a decision rule for predicting whether a gene is up- or down-regulated in
a particular experiment based on (1) the presence of binding site subsequences
(``motifs'') in the gene's regulatory region and (2) the expression levels of
regulators such as transcription factors in the experiment (``parents''). Thus
our learning task integrates two qualitatively different data sources:
genome-wide cDNA microarray data across multiple perturbation and mutant
experiments along with motif profile data from regulatory sequences. Rather
than focusing on the regression task of predicting real-valued gene expression
measurements, GeneClass performs the classification task of predicting +1 and
-1 labels, corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond the levels of
biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. GeneClass uses the
Adaboost learning algorithm with a margin-based generalization of decision
trees called alternating decision trees. In computational experiments based on
the Gasch S. cerevisiae dataset, we show that the GeneClass method predicts up-
and down-regulation on held-out experiments with high accuracy. We explore a
range of experimental setups related to environmental stress response, and we
retrieve important regulators, binding site motifs, and relationships between
regulators and binding sites that are known to be associated to specific stress
response pathways. Our method thus provides predictive hypotheses, suggests
biological experiments, and provides interpretable insight into the structure

usually prime numbers. In the current work, we develop a spatially extended
model at which preys and predators coexist and can change their evolutionary
dynamics through the occurrence of mutations. We verified that prime numbers as
life cycles emerge as a result of the evolution of the population. Our results
seem to be a first step in order to prove that the development of such strategy
is selectively advantageous, especially for those organisms that are highly
vulnerable to attacks of predators.

potentially applicable to arbtrary interacting systems. The method consists in
in approximating the original Hamiltonian by one corresponding to a suitable
exactly solvable system (with interaction) such that the ""quantum average"" of
both are equal, thus forcing self-consistency.The method transcends the
limitations of the variational method and the perturbation theory.The results
are systematically improvable by the construction of a improved perturbation
theory (IPT) which automatically satisfies the condition of convergence.
Uniformly accurate results are obtained for the case of the quartic-,sextic-
and octic anharmonic oscillators as well as the quartic and sextic double well
oscillators. The leading order results reproduce earlier results by different
methods using different input assumptions.The results for the sextic
oscillators agree well with exact prediction of supersymmetry. We also discuss
the stability and structure of the effective vacuum state of the approximation.

  Atoms","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We study spontaneous emission from an atom under the action of laser fields.
We consider two different energy level diagrams. The first one consists of two
levels resonantly driven by laser radiation where either of levels may decay to
a separate level. For such a system we show that the presence of the second
decay channel may deteriorate the destructive interference occurring in case of
one decay channel because of Autler-Townes effect. The second diagram
represents two two-level resonantly driven systems with the upper levels
decaying to a common level. For this diagram we show that there is no
interference between the two decay channels when the laser fields are described
in the Fock representation, while in case of definite-phase classical fields
such interference takes place and is partially or completely destructive or
constructive depending on the initial conditions and on the mutual orientation
of the spontaneous emission dipole moments.

quantum computer. We provide a prescription to construct an optimal controller
for an arbitrary unitary gate and apply it to a $ k $-dimensional unitary gate
which operates on an $ N $-dimensional Hilbert space with $ N \geq 2k $. Our
construction is applied to several important unitary gates such as the Hadamard
gate, the CNOT gate, and the two-qubit discrete Fourier transformation gate.
Controllers for these gates are explicitly constructed.
