observed rapid motions of pulsars. Three-dimensional numerical calculations
show that, in the absence of neutrino oscillations, the recoil velocities of
neutron stars should not exceed 200 km/s, while there exists a substantial
population of pulsars that move faster than 1000 km/s. A small asymmetry in the
neutrino emission may be the solution of this long-standing puzzle. Such an
asymmetry could arise from neutrino oscillations, but, given the present bounds
on the neutrino masses, the pulsar kicks require a sterile neutrino with a 1-20
keV mass and a small mixing with active neutrinos. The same particle can be the
cosmological dark matter. Its existence can be confirmed by X-ray telescopes if
they detect X-ray photons from the decays of the relic sterile neutrinos. One
can also verify the neutrino kick mechanism by observing gravity waves from a
nearby supernova.

LCDM dark matter (DM), hot gas and central black hole. DM is negligible in the
inner regions, which are dominated by stars and the central black hole. This
prevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope
of the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction
decreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with
line-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s
accuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the
virial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found
in LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear
inconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al. (2003) of planetary
nebulae between 2 and 5 R_e, which imply such low M/Ls that the baryon fraction
within r_v must be greater than the universal value. Replacing the NFW DM model
by the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given
radius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within
r_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model. Folding in the slight
(strong) radial anisotropy found in LCDM (merger) simulations, which is well
modelled (much better than with the Osipkov-Merritt formula) with beta(r) = 1/2
r/(r+a), the inferred M/L within r_v is another 1.6 (2.4) times higher than for
the isotropic NFW model. Thus, the DM model and radial anisotropy can partly
explain the low PN VDs, but not in full. In an appendix, single integral
expressions are derived for the VDs in terms of the tracer density and total
mass profiles, for 3 anisotropic models: radial, Osipkov-Merritt, and the model
above, for general radial profiles of luminosity density and mass.

to determine whether the mass distribution together with the hydrodynamical

gas morphology in the inner regions of the sample barred galaxies. The light
distribution is obtained from the $H$-band and the $I$-band combined together.
The M/L is determined using population synthesis models. The observations and
the methodology of the mass distribution modelling are presented in a companion
paper. The SPH models using the stellar mass models obtained directly from the
$H$-band light distributions give a good representation of the gas distribution
and dynamics of the modelled galaxies, supporting the maximum disk assumption.
This result indicates that the gravitational field in the inner region is
mostly provided by the stellar luminous component. When 40% of the total mass
is transferred to an axisymmetric dark halo, the modelled kinematics clearly
depart from the observed kinematics, whereas the departures are negligible for
dark mass halos of 5% and 20% of the total mass. This result sets a lower limit
for the contribution of the luminous component of about 80%, which is in
agreement with the maximum disk definition of the stellar mass contribution to
the rotation curve (about 85%$\pm$10).

protoplanets as a result of gravitational instability for cooling times
comparable to the orbital time. Fragmentation does not occur in binary systems
with a separation of about 60 AU. This is because efficient heating owing to
strong tidally induced spiral shocks damps any overdensity. The resulting
temperatures, above 200 K, would vaporize water ice in the outer disk, posing a
problem even for the other model of giant planet formation, core-accretion.
Light disks ($M \sim 0.01 M_{\odot}$) do not fragment but remain cold because
their low self-gravity inhibits strong shocks. Core accretion would not be
hampered in the latter. At separations of about 120 AU the efficiency of
fragmentation by disk instability rises and approaches that in isolated
systems. If disk instability is the main formation mechanism for giant planets,
on going surveys targeting binary systems should find considerably fewer

BATSE (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) on Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory,
BeppoSAX and now HETE II (High-Energy Transient Explorer), together with ground
optical, infrared and radio observatories have revolutionized our understanding
of GRBs showing that they are cosmological, that they are accompanied by long
lasting afterglows and that they are associated with core collapse Supernovae.
At the same time a theoretical understanding has emerged in the form of the
fireball internal-external shocks model. According to this model GRBs are
produced when the kinetic energy of an ultra-relativistic flow is dissipated in
internal collisions. The afterglow arises when the flow is slowed down by
shocks with the surrounding circum-burst matter. This model has numerous
successful predictions like the prediction of the afterglow itself, the
prediction of jet breaks in the afterglow light curve and of an optical flash
that accompanies the GRBs themselves. In this review I focus on theoretical

between the Bondi radius of the core, photon mean free path in the nebular gas,
and the luminosity radius (roughly the size of the sphere which can radiate
luminosity of the core at effective temperature equal to the nebular
temperature). Cores in the inner parts of protoplanetary disk (within roughly
0.3 AU from the Sun) have large luminosity radii resulting in the atmospheres
of the first type, while cores in the giant planet region (beyond several AU)
have small luminosity radii and always accumulate massive atmospheres of the
second type. Critical core mass for nucleated instability is found to vary as a
function of distance from the Sun. It is 5-20 M_Earth at 0.1-1 AU which is too
large to permit the formation of ``hot Jupiters'' by nucleated instability near
the cores that have grown in situ. In the region of giant planets critical mass
is 20-60 M_Earth (for opacity 0.1 cm^2/g) if planetesimal accretion was fast
enough for protoplanetary cores to form prior to the nebular gas dissipation.
This might indicate that giant planets in the Solar System have gained their

Doppler images during the decline phase of the Halpha emission line show
evidence for a hotspot and emission from the gas stream: the hotspot is
observed to vary its position, which may be due to the precession of the disk.
The data available during quiescence show that the centroid of the Halpha
emission line is offset by about -100 km/s from the systemic velocity which
suggests that the disk continues to precess. A Halpha tomogram reveals emission
from near the donor star after subtraction of the ring-like contribution from
the accretion disk which we attribute to chromospheric emission. No hotspot is
present suggesting that accretion from the secondary has stopped (or decreased
significantly) during quiescence. Finally, a comparison is made with the black
hole XRN GRO J0422+32: we show that the Halpha profile of this system also
exhibits a behaviour consistent with a precessing disk.

Chandra, XMM and optical observations. The system is found to be a fossil
galaxy group. The group X-ray emission is composed of a central dense cool core
(10 kpc in radius) and an isothermal medium beyond the central 10 kpc. The
region between 10 and 50 kpc (the cooling radius) has the same temperature as
the gas from 50 kpc to 400 kpc although the gas cooling time between 10 and 50
kpc (2 - 6 Gyr) is shorter than the Hubble time. Thus, the ESO 3060170 group
does not have a group-sized cooling core. We suggest that the group cooling
core may have been heated by a central AGN outburst in the past and the small
dense cool core is the truncated relic of a previous cooling core. The Chandra
observations also reveal a variety of X-ray features in the central region,
including a ``finger'', an edge-like feature and a small ``tail'', all aligned
along a north-south axis, as are the galaxy light and group galaxy
distribution. The proposed AGN outburst may cause gas ``sloshing'' around the
center and produce these asymmetric features. The observed flat temperature
profile to 1/3 R_vir is not consistent with the predicted temperature profile
in recent numerical simulations. We compare the entropy profile of the ESO
3060170 group with those of three other groups and find a flatter relation than
that predicted by simulations involving only shock heating, S $\propto$ r$^{~
0.85}$. This is direct evidence for the importance of non-gravitational
processes in group centers. We derive the mass profiles within 1/3 R_vir and
find the ESO 3060170 group is the most massive fossil group known (1 - 2 X
10$^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$). The M/L ratio of the system, ~ 150 at 0.3 R_vir, is
normal.

contradict a simple expectation if supermassive black holes are the main
heating source of a cluster core. Moreover, if we assume a canonical energy
conversion rate (10%), black holes alone are unable to sufficiently heat the
clusters with strong centrally peaked X-ray emission (``massive cooling
flows'') over the lifetime of cluster cores. These results may indicate that
massive cooling flows are a transient phenomenon, which may be because the

a number of complications that arise in the mapping from sandpile correlations
to spanning tree correlations; the structure of our results suggests a
conjecture that could greatly simplify future calculations. We find a number of
three-point functions along closed boundaries, and propose closed boundary

dissipative defect sites, at which the number of grains is not conserved, and
show that dissipative defects along closed boundaries, and in the bulk, have no
effect on any weakly allowed cluster variables, or on their correlations. Along
open boundaries, we find a particularly simple field structure; we calculate
all $n$-point correlations, for any combinations of height variables and
dissipative defect sites, and find that all heights and defects are represented
by the same field operator.

low field magnetization shows a transition to a highly anisotropic
ferromagnetic phase at 270 K, followed by another magnetic transition to an
antiferromagnetic phase at a slightly lower temperature. The magnetization data
are suggestive of weak correlations between the Gd-spins but no clear signature
of ordering is seen for T > 2 K. Significant anisotropy between the a-b plane

with current flow in the ab plane is positive rather than negative as for Gd.
The magnitude and the hysteresis of the MR for EuBaCo2O5.5 decrease with

equilibrium densities below $T_{ps}$. This simulation provides quantitative
results %on the hole doping and temperature %dependence of the degree of the

be valid globally in the Cauchy development, especially when Hadamard states
are chosen. We can thus compare the semiclassical behaviour with spherical dust
case, looking upon the metric as well as state specific information as
evolution from initial data. We first recover the divergence on the Cauchy
horizon obtained earlier. We point out that the semiclassical domain extends
right upto the Cauchy horizon. This is different from the spherical dust case
where the quantum gravity domain sets in before. We also find that the
backreaction is not negligible near the central singularity, unlike the dust
case. Apart from these differences, the Reissner Nordstrom solution has a
similarity with dust in that it is stable over a considerable period of time.
The features appearing dust collapse mentioned above were suggested to be
generally applicable within spherical symmetry. Reissner Nordstrom background
(along with the quantum state) generated from initial data, is shown not to

effective action, based on BPS equations. Firstly, both for the Yang-Mills
action and the Born-Infeld action it is shown that these configurations are
indeed BPS, i.e. solutions to these equations saturate a Bogomolny bound and
leave some supersymmetry unbroken. Next, we use the BPS equations as a tool to
construct the D-brane effective action and require that (a deformation of)
these equations should still imply the equations of motion in more general
cases. In the abelian case we managed to calculate all order in $\alpha'$
four-derivative corrections to the effective action and the BPS equations while
in the non-abelian case we obtained the effective action up to order
$\alpha'^4$. Furthermore, we discuss a check based on the spectrum of strings
stretching between intersecting branes. Finally, this Ph.D. thesis also
discusses the construction of a boundary superspace which is the first step to
use the method of Weyl invariance in N=2 superspace in order to again construct
the D-brane effective action. A more detailed summary of each chapter can be
found in the introduction.

which the first $m$ strands form the identity braid. Let
$B_{m,\infty}=\cup_nB_{m,n}$. We will describe explicit algebraic moves on
$B_{m,\infty}$ such that equivalence classes under these moves classify
oriented links up to isotopy in a link complement or in a closed, connected,
oriented 3--manifold. The moves depend on a fixed link representing the
manifold in $S^3$. More precisely, for link complements the moves are: the two
familiar moves of the classical Markov equivalence together with {\em `twisted'
conjugation} by certain loops $a_i$. This means premultiplication by
${a_i}^{-1}$ and postmultiplication by a `combed' version of $a_i$. For closed
3--manifolds there is an additional set of {\it `combed' band moves} which
correspond to sliding moves over the surgery link. The main tool in the proofs
is the one-move Markov Theorem using {\it $L$--moves} \cite{LR} (adding in-box
crossings). The resulting algebraic classification is a direct extension of the
classical Markov Theorem that classifies links in $S^3$ up to isotopy, and
potentially leads to powerful new link invariants, which have been explored in
special cases by the first author. It also provides a controlled range of
isotopy moves, useful for studying skein modules of 3--manifolds.

Rydberg-Ritz principle only. It is shown that a link between a set of
rovibronic term values and a set of wavenumbers of observed rovibronic spectral
lines appears when three and more different electronic-vibrational states are
pairwise-connected by radiative transitions. The method differs from known
techniques in several aspects, namely, it: 1) doesn't need any assumptions
concerning an internal structure of a molecule; 2) doesn't involve any
intermediate parameters (as molecular constants in traditional techniques); 3)
gives an opportunity to use in one-stage optimization procedure all available
experimental data obtained for various band systems, by various authors, and in
various works; 4) provides in an interactive mode the opportunity to select the
experimental values, eliminating rough errors, to revise wrong identifications
of spectral lines and to compare various sets of experimental data for mutual
consistency; 5) allows to obtain not only an optimal set of rovibronic term
values, but also the error bars depending on quantity and quality of existing
experimental data. Necessary precondition for use of this method is a
preliminary identification of electronic-vibro-rotational lines to certain
electronic-vibro-rotational radiative transitions. For this purpose one has to
use traditional methods of the analysis of molecular spectra.

to use accurate REMC simulations where bound states (molecules) are treated on
the Born-Oppenheimer level using a binding potential calculated by Kolos and
Wolniewicz. The remaining interaction is then reduced to the scattering between
neutral particles which is reliably treated classically applying effective
