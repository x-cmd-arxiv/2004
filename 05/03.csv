of the CMB anisotropy distribution show cosmologically interesting and
unexpected morphologies and amplitudes. In this paper, we apply a power
equalization (PE) filter to the high-latitude WMAP data in order to reconstruct
these low-l multipoles free from the largest Galactic foreground modelling
uncertainties in the Galactic plane. The characteristic spatial distributions
of the modes of order l=2,3,4,5 have been determined as a function of
frequency, sky coverage and two methods for foreground correction: using the
template fitting results of Bennett et al. (2003) and by a simple linear
projection scheme assuming the spectral dependence of the foreground
components. Our analyses suggest that the K and Ka frequency bands remain
significantly contaminated by residual foreground emission for the WMAP Kp2
mask. However, the l=3,4,5 multipole maps for the Q, V and W channels indicate
that, after foreground cleaning, these multipoles are dominated by the CMB
anisotropy component. We confirm the Tegmark et al. (2003) result that the
octopole does indeed show structure in which its hot and cold spots are centred
on a single plane in the sky, and show further that this is very stable with
respect to the applied mask and foreground correction. The estimated quadrupole
is much less stable showing non-negligible dependence on the Galactic
foreground correction. Including these uncertainties is likely to weaken the
statistical significance of the claimed alignment between the quadrupole and
octopole. Nevertheless, these anisotropy patterns are also present for in
COBE-DMR data, and are unlikely to be associated with instrumental systematic
artifacts.

follows closely that of the dark matter, the distribution of dark matter
subhaloes is much less centrally concentrated. The velocity dispersion profiles
of galaxies are also very similar to those of the dark matter, while those for
subhaloes are biased high, particularly in the inner regions of clusters. We
explain how these differences, already clearly visible in earlier work, are a
consequence of the formation of galaxies at the centres of dark matter haloes.
Galaxies and subhaloes represent different populations and are not directly
comparable. Evolution produces a complex and strongly position--dependent
relation between galaxies and the subhaloes in which they reside. This relation
can be properly modelled only by appropriate physical representation of the

unprecedented statistical power requires a correspondingly careful analysis of

reanalyze the raw spectra to make use of information not preserved by the

resolution of the spectrograph, sky subtraction, quasar continuum, and metal
absorption. We find that background sources such as metals contribute
significantly to the total power and have to be subtracted properly. We also
find clear evidence for SiIII correlations with the Ly-alpha forest and suggest
a simple model to account for this contribution to the power. While it is
likely that our newly developed analysis technique does not eliminate all
systematic errors in the P_F(k,z) measurement below the level of the
statistical errors, our tests indicate that any residual systematics in the

recently suggested as a way to explain the horizontal branch blue tails, in
those clusters which show a primordial spread in the abundances of CNO and
other elements involved in advanced CNO burning (D'Antona et al. 2002). In this
paper we examine the implications of the hypothesis that, in many globular
clusters, stars were born in two separate events: an initial burst (first
generation), which gives origin to probably all high and intermediate mass
stars and to a fraction of the cluster stars observed today, and a second,
prolonged star formation phase (second generation) in which stars form directly
from the ejecta of the intermediate mass stars of the first generation. In
particular, we consider in detail the morphology of the horizontal branch in
NGC 2808 and argue that it unveils the early cluster evolution, from the birth
of the first star generation to the end of the second phase of star formation.
This framework provides a feasible interpretation for the still unexplained
dichotomy of NGC 2808 horizontal branch, attributing the lack of stars in the
RR Lyr region to the gap in the helium content between the red clump, whose
stars are considered to belong to the first stellar generation and have
primordial helium, and the blue side of the horizontal branch, whose minimum
helium content reflects the helium abundance in the smallest mass
(~4Msun)contributing to the second stellar generation. This scenario provides
constraints on the required Initial Mass Function, in a way that a great deal
of remnant neutron stars and stellar mass black holes might have been produced.

low-density limit, Mg XI lines betray the presence of high plasma densities ($>
10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$) for most of the sources with higher X-ray luminosity ($>
10^{30}$ erg/s); stars with higher $L_X$ and $L_X/L_{bol}$ tend to have higher
densities at high temperatures. Ratios of O VII lines yield much lower
densities of a few $10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that the ``hot'' and
``cool'' plasma resides in physically different structures. Our findings imply
remarkably compact coronal structures, especially for the hotter plasma
emitting the Mg XI lines characterized by coronal surface filling factor,
$f_{MgXI}$, ranging from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-1}$, while we find $f_{OVII}$
values from a few $10^{-3}$ up to $\sim 1$ for the cooler plasma emitting the O

X-ray flux level as solar active regions, suggesting that these stars become
completely covered by active regions. At the same surface flux level,
$f_{MgXI}$ is seen to increase more sharply with increasing surface flux. These
results appear to support earlier suggestions that hot $10^7$ K plasma in
active coronae arises from flaring activity, and that this flaring activity
increases markedly once the stellar surface becomes covered with active

(VLM) members of the Pleiades. Periodic photometric variability was detected
for nine VLM stars with masses between 0.08 and 0.25 MS. These variations are
most likely caused by co-rotating, magnetically induced spots. In comparison
with solar-mass stars, the photometric amplitudes are very low (<0.04 mag),
implying that either the fraction of the spot-covered area, the asymmetry of
the spot distribution, or the contrast between spots and photospheric
environment decreases with mass. From our lightcurves, there is evidence for
temporal evolution of the spot patterns on timescales of about two weeks. The
rotation periods range from 2.9 h to 40 h and tend to increase linearly with
mass. Compared with more massive stars, we clearly see a lack of slow rotators
among VLM objects. The rotational evolution of VLM stars is investigated by
evolving the previously published periods for very young objects (Scholz &
Eisloeffel 2004) forward in time, and comparing them with those observed here
in the Pleiades. We find that the combination of spin-up by pre-main sequence
contraction and exponential angular momentum loss through stellar winds is able
to reproduce the observed period distribution in the Pleiades. This result may
be explained as a consequence of convective, small-scale magnetic fields.

growth by factor of 8-800 happens in these super-Eddington accretion phase of
AGNs. Moreover, there is a possible, systematic underestimation of accretion
rates (in the Eddington unit) due to an overestimation of BH mass by massive
accretion discs for super-Eddington objects. If it is true, the factor of BH
growth above may be larger by order(s) of magnitude. In contrast, the growth
factor expected in sub-Eddington phase is only ~ 2. Therefore, the cosmic BH
growth by accretion is likely dominated by super-Eddington phase, rather than
sub-Eddington phase which is the majority among AGNs.
  This analysis is based on the fraction and the average accretion rate of
NLS1s and NLQs obtained for z ~< 0.5. If those numbers are larger at higher
redshift (where BHs were probably less grown), super-Eddington accretion would
be even more important in the context of cosmic BH growth history.

wind. Eleven X-ray sources constitute a well-defined sample of 2 G, 2 K0-K4,

typically log Lx ~ 27 erg/s and is dominated by flares rather than quiescent
coronal emission. Models of the population indicates that the CDF-N stars are
the most magnetically active old disk stars. A substantial decline in X-ray
luminosities over the 1<t<11 Gyr age interval is required. This is the first
demonstration that the coronal and flaring components of stellar magnetic
activity -- and presumably the interior magnetic dynamos responsible for the

recently been raised regarding the ability of such a model to reproduce

that the dipolar mode is preferred when certain reasonable conditions are

is shown to reproduce various aspects of observational data, including the

nearby, rich clusters to a limit of M_U=-17.5 (M*_U+2). Our analysis is based
on a combination of separate spectroscopic and R-band and U-band photometric
surveys. For this purpose, we have developed a new maximum-likelihood algorithm
for calculating the luminosity function that is particularly useful for
reconstructing the galaxy distribution function in multi-dimensional spaces
(e.g., the number of galaxies as a simultaneous function of luminosity in
different filter bands, surface brightness, star formation rate, morphology,

  The composite luminosity function can be described by a Schechter function
with characteristic magnitude M*_U=-19.82+/-0.27 and faint end slope
alpha_U=-1.09+/-0.18. The total U-band GLF is slightly steeper than the R-band
GLF, indicating that cluster galaxies are bluer at fainter magnitudes.

layer weakens the strain inside the dot by only 1% relative change, while it
reduces the energy gap between a confined electron and hole level by as much as
10%. The small change in the strain distribution indicates that strain relaxes
only little through the thin wetting layer. The large reduction of the energy
gap is attributed to the increase of the confining-potential width rather than
the change of the potential height. First-order perturbation calculations or,
alternatively, the addition of an InAs disk below the quantum dot confirm this
conclusion. The effect of the wetting layer on the wave function is
qualitatively different for the weakly confined electron state and the strongly

a Fermi system near FCQPT or undergone FCQPT is controlled by the system of
quasiparticles resembling the Landau quasiparticles. Contrary to the Landau
quasiparticles, the effective mass of these quasiparticles strongly depends on
the temperature, magnetic fields, density, etc. This system of quasiparticles
having general properties determines the universal behavior of the Fermi system
in question. As a result, the universal behavior persists up to relatively high

CQPT. We analyze striking recent measurements of specific heat, charge and heat
transport used to study the nature of magnetic field-induced QCP in

agreement with our scenario based on FCQPT and certainly seem to rule out the

infinite-state formalism (non Turing-powerful) which subsumes many common
models such as Pushdown Processes and Petri Nets. PRSs can be adopted as formal
models for programs with dynamic creation and synchronization of concurrent
processes, and with recursive procedures. The model-checking problem for PRSs
and action-based linear temporal logic (ALTL) is undecidable. However,
decidability for some interesting fragment of ALTL remains an open question. In
this paper we state decidability results concerning generalized acceptance
properties about infinite derivations (infinite term rewriting) in PRSs. As a
consequence, we obtain decidability of the model-checking (restricted to
infinite runs) for PRSs and a meaningful fragment of ALTL.

  terms of strings","147 pages, 5 figures",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph hep-th",,"  This paper is a significantly expanded version of gr-qc/0306066. It discusses
the geometric properties of the so called holographic solution, an exact,
spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein field equations with zero
cosmological constant. The holographic solution can be regarded as the simplest
solution of the field equations including matter. Its interior matter-density
follows an inverse square law: e = 1 / (8 pi r2). The interior principle
pressures are P_r = - e in the radial direction and P_tan = 0 in the tangential
direction. This is the equation of state of a radial arrangement of strings.
The interior string type matter state is densely packed, each string occupying
a transverse extension of exactly one Planck area, and bounded by a membrane
consisting out of tangential pressure. The membrane's energy density is zero,
as expected from string theory. Despite its simple structure, the results that
can be derived from this solution are far from trivial. It is not possible to
give a fair account of all relevant results in a 20-line abstract. The reader
is referred to the abstract in the paper, which summarizes some of the more
important results. The author appreciates any comments, critique or suggestions

  the Hawking temperature","27 pages, 1 figure",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph hep-th",,"  In the spherically symmetric case the Einstein field equations take on their
simplest form for a matter-density rho = 1 / (8 pi r^2), from which a radial
metric coefficient g_{rr} \propto r follows. The boundary of an object with
such an interior matter-density is situated slightly outside of its
gravitational radius. Its surface-redshift scales with z \propto \sqrt{r}, so
that any such large object is practically indistinguishable from a black hole,
as seen from exterior space-time. The interior matter has a well defined
temperature, T \propto 1 / \sqrt{r}. Under the assumption, that the interior
matter can be described as an ultra-relativistic gas, the object's total
entropy and its temperature at infinity can be calculated by microscopic
statistical thermodynamics. They are equal to the Hawking result up to a
possibly different constant factor. The simplest solution of the field
equations with rho = 1 / (8 pi r^2) is the so called holographic solution,
short ""holostar"". It has an interior string equation of state. The strings are
densely packed, explaining why the solution does not collapse to a singularity.
The holographic solution has been shown to be a very accurate model for the
universe as we see it today in Ref[7]. The factor relating the holostar's
temperature at infinity to the Hawking temperature can be expressed in terms
the holostar's interior (local) radiation temperature and its (local)
matter-density, allowing an experimental verification of the Hawking
temperature law. Using the recent experimental data for the CMBR-temperature
and the total matter-density in the universe measured by WMAP, the Hawking
formula is verified to an accuracy of 1%.

  systems at ultra-high temperatures","51 pages, 2 figures, appendix ""thermodynamics of an ideal gas"" (14
  pages)",,,,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  It is shown, that self-gravitating systems can be classified by a
dimensionless constant positive number $\kappa = S T / E$, which can be
determined from the (global) values for the entropy, temperature and (total)
energy. The Kerr-Newman black hole family is characterized by $\kappa$ in the
range $0-1/2$, depending on the dimensionless ratios of angular momentum and
charge squared to the horizon area, $J/A$ and $Q^2/A$. By analyzing the most
general case of an ultra-relativistic ideal gas with non-zero chemical
potential it is shown, that $\kappa$ is an important parameter which determines
the (local) thermodynamic properties of an ultra-relativistic gas. $\kappa$
only depends on the chemical potential per temperature $u = \mu / T$ and on the
ratio of bosonic to fermionic degrees of freedom $r_F = f_B / f_F$. A gas with
zero chemical potential has $\kappa = 4/3$. Whenever $\kappa < 4/3$ the gas
must acquire a non-zero chemical potential. This non-zero chemical potential
induces a natural matter-antimatter asymmetry, whenever microscopic statistical
thermodynamics can be applied. The recently discovered holographic solution
describes a compact self gravitating black hole type object with an interior,
well defined matter state. One can associate a local - possibly
observer-dependent - value of $\kappa$ to the interior matter, which lies in
the range $2/3-1$ (for the uncharged case). This finding is used to construct
an alternative scenario of baryogenesis in the context of the holographic

equations. It describes a compact self-gravitating object with properties
similar to a black hole. Its entropy and temperature at infinity are
proportional to the Hawking result. Instead of an event horizon, the
holographic solution has a real spherical boundary membrane, situated roughly
two Planck distances outside of the object's gravitational radius. The interior
matter-state is singularity free. It consists out of string type matter, which
is densely packed. Each string has a transverse extension of exactly one Planck
area. This dense package of strings might be the reason, why the solution does
not collapse to a singularity. The local string tension is inverse proportional
to the average string length. This purely classical result has its almost exact
correspondence in a recent result in string theory. The holographic solution
suggest, that string theory is relevant also on cosmological scales. The large
scale phenomena in the universe can be explained naturally in a string context.
Due to the zero active gravitational mass-density of the strings the Hubble
constant in a string dominated universe is related to its age by H t = 1. The
WMAP measurements have determined H t \approx 1.02 \pm 0.02 experimentally. The
nearly unaccelerated expansion in a string dominated universe is compatible
with the recent supernova measurements. Under the assumption, that the cold
dark matter (CDM) consists out of strings, the ratio of CDM to baryonic matter
is estimated as \Omega_CDM / \Omega_b \approx 6.45. Some arguments are given,
which suggest that the universe might be constructed hierarchically out of its
most basic building blocks: strings and membranes.

Lyapunov exponents of the Teichmuller geodesic flow on the deviation of ergodic
averages for generic conservative flows on higher genus surfaces. The result on
the Teichmuller flow is formulated in terms of a (symplectic) cocycle on the
real cohomology bundle over the moduli space of holomorphic differentials
introduced by Kontsevich and Zorich. We prove that such a cocycle is
non-uniformly hyperbolic, that is, all of its Lyapunov exponents are different
from zero. In particular, the number of strictly positive exponents is equal to
the genus of the surface. From this theorem we derive that ergodic integrals of
smooth functions for generic area-preserving flows on higher genus surfaces
grow with time according to a power-law asymptotics with a number of terms
equal to the genus of the surface and stricltly positive exponents equal to the
non-negative Lyapunov exponents of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle. In
particular, for conservative flows on surfaces of higher genus, the deviation
of ergodic averages for a generic smooth function obeys a power law with a
strictly positive exponent and, consequently, the Denjoy-Koksma inequality does
not hold. The derivation of the deviation theorem relies in a fundamental way
on the notion of invariant distribution for flows on surfaces and the related
notion of basic current for the orbit foliation.

SERIES 6, 40-44 (2004)","10.1088/0741-3335/46/7/003",,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  The constraint of incompressibility is often used to simplify the
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description of linearized plasma dynamics because it
does not affect the ideal MHD marginal stability point. In this paper two
methods for introducing incompressibility are compared in a cylindrical plasma
model: In the first method, the limit $\gamma \to \infty$ is taken, where
$\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats; in the second, an anisotropic mass
tensor $\mathbf{\rho}$ is used, with the component parallel to the magnetic
field taken to vanish, $\rho_{\parallel} \to 0$. Use of resistive MHD reveals
the nature of these two limits because the Alfv\'en and slow magnetosonic
continua of ideal MHD are converted to point spectra and moved into the complex
plane. Both limits profoundly change the slow-magnetosonic spectrum, but only
the second limit faithfully reproduces the resistive Alfv\'en spectrum and its
wavemodes. In ideal MHD, the slow magnetosonic continuum degenerates to the
Alfv\'en continuum in the first method, while it is moved to infinity by the
second. The degeneracy in the first is broken by finite resistivity. For
numerical and semi-analytical study of these models, we choose plasma
equilibria which cast light on puzzling aspects of results found in earlier
literature.

sodium clusters are studied by means of the time-dependent local-density

$\lambda\mu =$20, 21 and 22 whose $\mu$ branches are separated by cluster
deformation. In light clusters with a low spectral density, IRQM are
unambiguously related to specific electron-hole excitations, thus giving access
to the single-electron spectrum near the Fermi surface (HOMO-LUMO region). Most
of IRQM are determined by cluster deformation and so can serve as a sensitive
probe of the deformation effects in the mean field. The IRQM branch $\lambda\mu
=$21 is coupled with the magnetic scissors mode, which gives a chance to detect
the latter. We discuss two-photon processes, Raman scattering (RS), stimulated
emission pumping (SEP), and stimulated adiabatic Raman passage (STIRAP), as the
relevant tools to observe IRQM. A new method to detect the IRQM population in

in that: (i) the unification in mathematical descriptions shows that many

actually share almost the same mathematical structures; (ii) it can provide
clue to us on suggesting more new effects which is similar in mathematical

experiments. In the dissipative case, we derive an expression for the time at
which quantum and classical predictions become different (breaking time) and
show that a complete quantum-classical correspondence is not possible in the
chaotic regime. For the diffusive environment we estimate the minimum value of
the diffusion coefficient necessary to retrieve the classical limit and also
show numerical evidence that, for diffusion below this threshold, the breaking
time behaves, essentially, as in the case of the system without a reservoir.
