10214 (``The Tadpole''). By taking advantage of the unprecedented high
resolution of the ACS in this very deep dataset we are able to characterize
spheroids at sub-arcseconds scales. Using the V_606W and I_814W bands, we
construct V-I color maps and extract color gradients for a sample of spheroids
at I_814W < 24 mag. We investigate the existence of a population of
morphologically classified spheroids which show extreme variation in their
internal color properties similar to the ones reported in the HDFs. These are
displayed as blue cores and inverse color gradients with respect to those
accounted from metallicity variations. Following the same analysis we find a
similar fraction of early-type systems (~30%-40%) that show non-homologous
internal colors, suggestive of recent star formation activity. We present two
statistics to quantify the internal color variation in galaxies and for tracing
blue cores, from which we estimate the fraction of non-homogeneous to
homogeneous internal colors as a function of redshift up to z<1.2. We find that
it can be described as about constant as a function of redshift, with a small
increase with redshift for the fraction of spheroids that present strong color
dispersions. The implications of a constant fraction at all redshifts suggests
the existence of a relatively permanent population of evolving spheroids up to
z~1. We discuss the implications of this in the context of spheroidal
formation.

chemical/dynamical model, particular emphasis is given to constraints the

study is to stress the importance of shielding the molecular gas from the
destructive effects of UV radiation. For shock ram pressures comparable to or
exceeding typical local ISM pressures, self-shielding controls the formation
time of H2 but CO formation requires shielding of the interstellar radiation
field by dust grains. We find that the molecular hydrogen fractional abundance
can become significant well before CO forms. The timescale for (CO) molecular
cloud formation is not set by H2 formation, but rather by the timescale for
accumulating a sufficient column density or extinction, A_V > 0.7. The local
ratio of atomic to molecular gas (4:1), coupled with short estimates for cloud
lifetimes (3-5 Myr), suggests that the timescales for accumulating molecular
clouds from atomic material typically must be no longer than about 12-20 Myr.
Based on the shielding requirement, this implies that the typical product of
pre-shock density and velocity must be n*v > 20 cm^-3 km s^-1. Based on these
results we find that flow-driven formation of molecular clouds in the local
interstellar medium can occur sufficiently rapidly to account for observations.
We also provide detailed predictions of atomic and molecular emission and
absorption that track molecular cloud formation, with a view toward helping to
verify cloud formation by shock waves. Finally, we provide an analytic solution
for time-dependent H2 formation which may be of use in numerical hydrodynamic
calculations.

cold dust component on the gaseous phase in the central regions of galactic
disks. We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for flat
multi-component disks embedded in a combined static stellar and dark matter
potential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the gas by a drag
force depending on their velocity difference.
  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or
near to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.
In that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for high azimuthal
modes (m~8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have a similar amplitude
resulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a larger
contrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas. The dust
peaks are frequently correlated with peaks of the gas distribution, but they do
not necessarily coincide with them. Therefore, a large scatter in the
dust-to-gas ratios is expected. The appearance of the dust is more cellular
(i.e. sometimes connecting different spiral features), whereas the gas is
organized in a multi-armed spiral structure.
  An admixture of 2% dust destabilizes gaseous disks substantially, whereas
dust-to-gas ratios below 1% have no influence on the evolution of the gaseous
disk. For a high dust-to-gas ratio of 10% the instabilities reach a saturation
level already after 30 Myr.

luminosity or velocity dispersion, galaxy mass), and (ii) a consistency between
the local mass density in BHs and that expected by summing up the light
received from distant active quasars. These results are partly shaped by
successive galactic mergers and BH coalescences, since mergers redistribute the
population of BHs in galaxies and BH binary coalescences reduce the mass
density in BHs through losses to gravitational waves. Here, we isolate and
quantify these effects by following the cosmological merger history of a
population of massive BHs representing the quasar population between z = 3 and
z =0. Our results suggest that the relation between BH mass and host galaxy
properties, and inferences on the global efficiency of BH accretion during
active quasar phases, could be influenced by the cumulative effect of repeated

black holes (SMBHs) in the local universe have allowed accurate comparisons of
rho_BH with the amount of light received from past quasar activity. These
comparisons support the notion that local SMBHs are ``dead quasars'' and yield
a value epsilon >~ 0.1 for the average radiative efficiency of cosmic SMBH
accretion. BH coalescences may represent an important component of the quasar
mass assembly and yet not produce any observable electromagnetic signature.
Therefore, ignoring gravitational wave (GW) emission during such coalescences,
which reduces the amount of mass locked into remnant BHs, results in an
overestimate of epsilon. Here, we put constraints on the magnitude of this
bias. We calculate the cumulative mass loss to GWs experienced by a
representative population of BHs during repeated cosmological mergers, using
loss prescriptions based on detailed general relativistic calculations. Despite
the possibly large number of mergers in the assembly history of each individual
SMBH, we find that near--equal mass mergers are rare, and therefore the
cumulative loss is likely to be modest, amounting at most to an increase by 20
percent of the inferred epsilon value. Thus, recent estimates of epsilon >~ 0.1
appear robust. The space interferometer LISA should provide empirical
constraints on the dark side of quasar evolution, by measuring the masses and
rates of coalescence of massive BHs to cosmological distances.

an asymmetric surface brightness distribution with respect to the central

located north of the radio galaxy, while the densest area of companion Ly-alpha

If the mm sources lie at z=4.1, none of them show excess Ly-alpha emission in
our narrow-band images. Both populations thus show no apparent overlap,
possibly due to dust quenching the Ly-alpha emission. If the mm sources are

deviate from Gaussianity. The analysis is performed on all sky, the northern

that only around 0.2% of them present such a cold spot. Excluding this spot,
the remaining map is compatible with Gaussianity and even the excess of

flux densities as large as 1 mJy. We also describe an initial, systematic
effort to search for radio emission in low radio frequency images acquired with
the Very Large Array. The limits set by the VLA images (~ 300 mJy) are
consistent with, but do not provide strong constraints on, the predictions of
the model. Future radio telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and
the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), should be able to detect the known extrasolar
planets or place austere limits on their radio emission. Planets with masses
much lower than those in the current census will probably radiate below 10 MHz
and will require a space-based array.

brightness pulsar radio emission. In this paper, we have numerically examined
the case where a transverse electromagnetic wave is distorting the motion of a
relativistic electron beam while travelling over one stellar radius ($ approx
10 :{km}$). For different sets of parameters, coherent emission is generated by
bunches of beam electrons in the radio domain, with bandwidths of 3 GHz. Pulse
power often reached $10^{13} :{W}$, which corresponds with brightness
temperature of $10^{30} :{K}$. The duration of these pulses is of the order of
nanoseconds. In the context of pulsar radio emission, our results indicate that
the laser can produce elementary bursts of radiation which build up the
observed microstructures of a few tens of microseconds duration. The process is
sensitive mostly to the beam particles energy, number density and the
background magnetic field, but much less so to the transverse wave parameters.
We demonstrate that the operation of a free-electron laser with a transverse
electromagnetic wiggler in the pulsar magnetosphere occurs preferably at moder
ate Lorentz factors $ gamma geq 100$, high beam density $n gtrsim 0.1

transitions of 19 molecules. 1.3 mm continuum data of the nuclear source are

prominent high density interstellar gas component characterized by $n_{\rm

compared with abundances observed toward the starburst galaxies NGC 253 and M
82 and galactic sources. Apparent is an `overabundance' of HNC in the nuclear
environment of NGC 4945. While the HNC/HCN $J$=1--0 line intensity ratio is
$\sim$0.5, the HNC/HCN abundance ratio is $\sim$1. While HCN is subthermally
excited ($T_{\rm ex}\sim$8 K), CN is even less excited ($T_{\rm ex}\sim$3--4
K), indicating that it arises from a less dense gas component and that its
$N$=2--1 line can be optically thin even though its $N$=1--0 emission is
moderately optically thick. Overall, fractional abundances of NGC 4945 suggest
that the starburst has reached a stage of evolution that is intermediate
between those observed in NGC 253 and M 82. Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur
isotope ratios are also determined. Within the limits of uncertainty, carbon
and oxygen isotope ratios appear to be the same in the nuclear regions of NGC

quasars, are believed to contain a large fraction of the neutral gas in the
Universe. Paradoxically, these systems are more difficult to observe at
z_abs<1.7, since they are rare and their HI feature then falls in UV spectra.
Rao & Turnshek (2000) pioneered a method based on MgII-selected DLAs, that is
absorbers discovered thanks to our knowledge of their MgII feature in optical
spectra. We use new observations undertaken at the TNG as well as a careful
literature & archival search to build samples of low redshift absorbers
classified according to the technique used for their discovery. We successfully
recover N(HI) and equivalent widths of FeII 2600, MgII 2796, MgII 2803 and MgII
2852 for a sample of 36 absorbers, 21 of which are MgII-selected. We find that
the MgII-selected sample contains a marginally larger fraction of absorbers
with log N(HI)>21.0 than seen otherwise at low redshift. If confirmed, this
property will in turn affect estimates of Omega_HI which is dominated by the
highest HI column densities. We find that log N(HI) does not correlate
significantly with metal equivalent widths. Similarly, we find no evidence that
gravitational lensing, the fraction of associated systems or redshift evolution
affect the absorber samples in a different way. We conclude that the hint of
discrepancies in N(HI) distributions most likely arises from small number
statistics. Therefore, further observations are required to better clarify the
impact of this discrepancy on estimates of Omega_HI at low redshift.

exponential as expected for this NP-hard problem, we find that the average

Impurity calculations based on the Quantum Monte Carlo method confirm this

enable the creation of matter and energy out of the self contained
gravitational and scalar fields constrained by the local conservation of energy
so that rest masses vary whereas the observed Newtonian Gravitation 'constant'
does not. There is a conformal equivalence between self-creation and General
Relativity in vacuo, which results in the predictions of the two theories being
equal in the standard tests. In self-creation test particles in vacuo follow
the geodesics of General Relativity. Nevertheless there are three types of
experiment, including the LIGO apparatus & Gravity Probe B geodetic precession,
which are able to distinguish between the two theories. Self-creation is as
consistent with cosmological constraints as the standard paradigm, without the
addition of the undiscovered physics of Inflation, dark non-baryonic matter, or
dark energy. It does demand an exotic equation of state, which requires a false
vacuum energy determined by the field equations. The two conformal frames
conserve energy or energy-momentum and choose photons or atoms as the standard
of measurement respectively. In the former frame the universe is stationary and
eternal with exponentially shrinking rulers and accelerating atomic clocks, and
in the latter frame the universe is freely coasting, expanding linearly from a
Big Bang with rigid rulers and regular atomic clocks. A novel representation of
space-time geometry is suggested. (Abridged)

then used to analyze the neutralino relic density consistent with the WMAP data

the combined set of constraints arising from modular invariant soft breaking,
radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and WMAP lead to upper limits on
sparticle masses for $\mu>0$. These limits are investigated for a class of

takes into account Debye screening in the hot quark-gluon-squark-gluino plasma.

investigation was prompted by the idea of conformal sequestering. In that
framework hidden sector renormalizations by nearly conformal dynamics are
critical. In the original models of conformal sequestering it was necessary to
impose hidden sector flavor symmetries to achieve the sequestered form. We
present models which can evade this requirement and lead to no-scale or anomaly
mediated boundary conditions; but the necessary structures do not seem generic.
More generally, the ratios of scalar masses to gaugino masses, the $\mu$-term,
the $B\mu$-term, $A$-terms, and the gravitino mass can be significantly

some critical value of the strange quark mass, this is replaced by the recently
proposed gapless CFL (gCFL) phase. We also find several other phases, for
instance, a metallic CFL (mCFL) phase, a so-called uSC phase where all colors

For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a
conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result
S_A\sim(c/3) log(l) of Holzhey et al. when A is a finite interval of length l
in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems,finite
temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals.
For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length \xi
is large but finite, we show that S_A\sim{\cal A}(c/6)\log\xi, where \cal A is
the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free
massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the
case of finite-size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models,
such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix
methods. Finally the free-field results are extended to higher dimensions, and
used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement
entropy near a quantum phase transition.

actually extended to full rook placements on a Ferrers board (the permutations
correspond to square boards), and the construction of the map $\phi^*$ is the
key step in proving the following result. Let $T$ be a set of patterns starting
with the prefix $12... k$. Let $T'$ be the set of patterns obtained by
replacing this prefix by $k... 21$ in every pattern of $T$. Then for all $n$,
the number of permutations of the symmetric group $\Sn_n$ that avoid $T$ equals
the number of permutations of $\Sn_n$ that avoid $T'$. Our commutation result,
generalized to Ferrers boards, implies that the number of {\em involutions} of
$\Sn_n$ that avoid $T$ is equal to the number of involutions of $\Sn_n$
avoiding $T'$, as recently conjectured by Jaggard.

interpreted in terms of ""quantum orbits"", which can be related to the
trajectories of a classical electron in an electric field. We obtain highly
asymmetric electron momentum distributions, which strongly depend on the
absolute phase, i.e., on the phase difference between the pulse envelope and
its carrier frequency. Around a particular value of this parameter, the
distributions shift from the region of positive to that of negative momenta, or
vice-versa, in a radical fashion. This behavior is investigated in detail for

measuring the absolute phase. Both models yield very similar distributions,
which share the same physical explanation. There exist, however, minor
discrepancies due to the fact that, beyond the region for which electron-impact
ionization is classically allowed, the yields from the quantum mechanical
computation decay exponentially, whereas their classical counterparts vanish.

experimentally demonstrated for the vibrational mode of a trapped ion. We
propose an implementation of quantum computation using coherent states of the
vibrational modes of trapped ions. Differently from earlier experiments, we
consider a far-off resonance for the interaction between external fields and
the ion in a bidimensional trap. By appropriate choices of the detunings
between the external fields, the adiabatic elimination of the ionic excited
level from the Hamiltonian of the system allows for beam splitting between
orthogonal vibrational modes, production of coherent states and non-linear
interactions of various kinds. In particular, this model enables the generation
of the four coherent Bell states. Furthermore, all the necessary operations for
quantum computation such as preparation of qubits, one-qubit and controlled
two-qubit operations, are possible. The detection of the state of a vibrational
mode in a Bell state is made possible by the combination of resonant and
off-resonant interactions between the ion and some external fields. We show
that our read-out scheme provides highly efficient discrimination between all
the four Bell states. We extend this to a quantum register composed of many
individually trapped ions. In this case, operations on two remote qubits are
possible through a cavity mode. We emphasize that our remote-qubit operation
scheme does not require a high quality factor resonator: the cavity field acts
as a catalyst for the gate operation.

(TMSS), whose Wigner function is nonnegative, is shown to hold only for
correlations among dynamical variables (DV) that cannot be interpreted via a

are given for Bell's suggestion that the EPR (Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen)

  It is argued that Bell's theorem disallowing the violation of Bell's
inequality within a local hidden-variable theory depends on the DV's having a
definite value --assigned by the LHV-- even when they cannot be simultaneously

interest if quantum mechanics were ever to fail in some regime, because a
scientifically and technologically advanced eavesdropper could perhaps use
post-quantum physics to extract information from quantum communications without
necessarily causing the quantum state disturbances on which existing security
proofs rely. Here we describe a key distribution scheme provably secure against

high temperatures. I analyze multipartite entanglement produced by the $\eta$
pairing mechanism which features strongly in the fermionic lattice models of
high $T_c$ superconductivity. This problem is shown to be equivalent to
calculating multipartite entanglement in totally symmetric states of qubits. I
demonstrate that we can conclusively calculate the relative entropy of
entanglement within any subset of qubits in an overall symmetric state. Three
main results then follow. First, I show that the condition for
superconductivity, namely the existence of the off diagonal long range order
(ODLRO), is not dependent on two-site entanglement, but on just classical
correlations as the sites become more and more distant. Secondly, the
entanglement that does survive in the thermodynamical limit is the entanglement
of the total lattice and, at half filling, it scales with the log of the number
of sites. It is this entanglement that will exist at temperatures below the
superconducting critical temperature, which can currently be as high as 160
Kelvin. Thirdly, I prove that a complete mixture of symmetric states does not
contain any entanglement in the macroscopic limit. On the other hand, the same
mixture of symmetric states possesses the same two qubit entanglement features
as the pure states involved, in the sense that the mixing does not destroy
entanglement for finite number of qubits, albeit it does decrease it. Maximal
mixing of symmetric states also does not destroy ODLRO and classical
correlations. I discuss various other inequalities between different
entanglements as well as generalizations to the subsystems of any
dimensionality (i.e. higher than spin half).
