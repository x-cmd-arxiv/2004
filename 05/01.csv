near redshift z=1 along a single quasar sightline (Q1727+5302) with neutral
hydrogen column densities of N(HI) = (1.45\pm0.15)\times10^{21} and
(2.60\pm0.20)\times10^{21} atoms/cm2. Their sightline velocity difference of
13,000 km/s corresponds to a proper separation of 106h_{70}^{-1} Mpc if
interpreted as the Hubble flow (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7). The random
probability of such an occurrence is significantly less than 3%. With follow-up
spectroscopy, we find [Zn/H] = -0.58\pm0.15 (26.5% solar) and -1.32\pm0.28
(4.7% solar), respectively, and [Cr/H] = -1.26\pm0.15 (5.5% solar) and
-1.77\pm0.28 (1.7% solar), respectively, which is evidence for depletion onto
grains. Follow-up IR images show the two most likely DLA galaxy candidates to
have impact parameters of 22h_{70}^{-1} kpc and 32h_{70}^{-1} kpc if near z=1.
They are significantly underluminous relative to the galaxy population at z=1.
To investigate the possibility of additional high-N(HI) absorbers we have
searched the SDSS database for z>1 quasars within 30 arcmin of the original
sightline. Five were found, and two show strong MgII-FeII absorption near z=1,
consistent with classical DLA absorption approx 37% of the time, but almost
always N(HI) > 10^{19} atoms/cm2. Consequently, this rare configuration of four
high-N(HI) absorbers with a total sightline velocity extent of 30,600 km/s may
represent a large filament-like structure stretching over a proper distance of
241h_{70}^{-1} Mpc along our sightline, and a region in space capable of
harboring excessive amounts of neutral gas. Future studies of this region of
the sky are encouraged.

At high state, emission from a hot collisional plasma dominates from about 1 to
8 keV. At low state, photons between 1 and 4 keV are absorbed. The hot plasma
is identified with the shock zone between the winds of the primary Wolf-Rayet
star and the secondary O giant. The absorption at low state is interpreted as
photoelectric absorption in the Wolf-Rayet wind. This absorption allows us to
measure the absorbing column density and to derive a mass loss rate 8x10^{-6}
M_sun/yr for the WC8 star. This mass loss rate, in conjunction with a previous
Wolf-Rayet wind model, provides evidence for a clumped WR wind. A clumping
factor of 16 is required. The X-ray spectra below 1 keV (12 Ang) show no
absorption and are essentially similar in both states. There is a rather clear
separation in that emission from a plasma hotter than 5 MK is heavily absorbed
in low state while the cooler plasma is not. This cool plasma must come from a
much more extended region than the hot material. The Neon abundance in the
X-ray emitting material is 2.5 times the solar value. The unexpected detection
of CV (25.3 Ang) and CVI (31.6 Ang) radiative recombination continua at both

sources that appear to be associated with deeply embedded, dense, young

significantly contaminated by synchrotron emission. The nonthermal components
are associated with regions of older star formation that have smaller ionized

radio components that agrees with our previous resolved stellar population
analysis, where an extended burst of star formation has pervaded the disk of
NGC 625 over the last ~ 50 Myr. We compare the nature of radio continuum

function formalism. The formalism ensures that SMS free energy exists all the
way to T=0, and remains stable. We introduce the concept of the reality
condition, according to which the entropy $S(T)$ of a set of coupled degrees of
freedom must be non-negative. The entropy crisis, which does not affect
stability, is identified as the violation of the reality condition. We identify
and validate rigorously, using general thermodynamic arguments, the following
general thermodynamic mechanism behind the entropy crisis in SMS. The free
energy $F_{\text{dis}}(T)$ of any SMS must be equal to the T=0 crystal free
energy $E_{0}$ at two different temperatures $T=0,$ and $T=T_{\text{eq}}>0$.
Thus, the stability requires $F_{\text{dis}}(T)$ to possess a maximum at an
intermediate but a strictly positive temperature $T_{\text{K}},$ where the
energy is $E=E_{\text{K}}.$ The SMS branch below $T_{\text{K}}$ gives the
entropy crisis and must be replaced by hand by an ideal glass free energy of
constant energy $E_{\text{K}},$ and vanishing entropy. Hence, $T_{\text{K}}>0$
represents the Kauzmann temperature. The ideal glass energy $E_{\text{K}}$ is
higher than the crystal energy $E_{0}$ at absolute zero, which is in agreement
with the experimenatal fact that the extrapolated energy of a real glass at T=0
is higher than its T=0 crystal energy. We confirm the general predictions by
two exact calculations, one of which is not mean-field. The calculations
clearly show that the notion of SMS is not only not vaccuous, but also not a
consequence of a mean-field analysis. They also show that certain folklore
cannot be substantiated.

coordinate time is computed for satellites in these orbital regimes. The
frequency shift as a function of time is computed for a signal observed on the

become parallel. They also represent an ingredient in a direct x-space
computation of DGLAP evolution kernels at next-to-next-to-leading order. To
obtain the splitting amplitudes, we use the unitarity sewing method. In
contrast to the usual light-cone gauge treatment, our calculation does not rely
on the principal-value or Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescriptions, even though the

integration-by-parts and Lorentz invariance identities. The master integrals
are computed with the aid of differential equations in the splitting momentum
fraction z. The epsilon-poles of the splitting amplitudes are consistent with a
formula due to Catani for the infrared singularities of two-loop scattering
amplitudes. This consistency essentially provides an inductive proof of
Catani's formula, as well as an ansatz for previously-unknown 1/epsilon pole

accounting for the contributions to these averages produced by closed dual

long-range interaction between points lying on the contour of the Wilson loop.
This interaction generates a Luescher-type term, even when one restrics oneself

the stochastic vacuum model. Beyond the London limit, it has been shown that a
modified interaction appears, which becomes reduced to the standard Yukawa one

of brane excitations on one side and various closed string backgrounds on the
other. In this lecture, we introduce the fundamental ingredients of modern
string theory and explain how they are modeled through 2D (boundary) conformal
field theory. This so-called `microscopic description' of strings and branes is
an active research area with new results ranging from the classification and
construction of boundary conditions to studies of 2D renormalization group
flows. We shall provide an overview of such developments before concluding the
lecture with an extensive outlook on some research that is motivated by current
problems in string theory. This includes investigations of non-rational and
non-unitary conformal field theories.

initial turbulent fluctuations as prescribed by an energy injection rate
epsilon_{in}, are varied systematically. The investigations suggest that the
shear parameter levels off for larger Reynolds numbers which is supported by
dimensional arguments. It is found that the skewness of the transverse

However, this does not necessarily lead to useful applications. To gauge the
practical significance of a quantum algorithm, one must weigh it against the
best conventional techniques applied to useful instances of the same problem.
Grover's quantum search algorithm is one of the most widely studied.
  We identify requirements for Grover's algorithm to be useful in practice: (1)
a search application S where classical methods do not provide sufficient
scalability; (2) an instantiation of Grover's algorithm Q(S) for S that has a
smaller asymptotic worst-case runtime than any classical algorithm C(S) for S;
(3) Q(S) with smaller actual runtime for practical instances of S than that of
any C(S).
  We show that several commonly-suggested applications fail to satisfy these
requirements, and outline directions for future work on quantum search.

formation and the entanglement of distillation--have so far been limited to
bipartite settings, the study of other entanglement measures for multipartite
systems appears necessary. Here, connections between two other entanglement
measures--the relative entropy of entanglement and the geometric measure of
entanglement--are investigated. It is found that for arbitrary pure states the
latter gives rise to a lower bound on the former. For certain pure states, some
bipartite and some multipartite, this lower bound is saturated, and thus their
relative entropy of entanglement can be found analytically in terms of their
known geometric measure of entanglement. For certain mixed states, upper bounds
on the relative entropy of entanglement are also established. Numerical
evidence strongly suggests that these upper bounds are tight, i.e., they are
actually the relative entropy of entanglement.
