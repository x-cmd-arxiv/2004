microlensing events in direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This is
carried out starting from a recently drawn coherent picture of the geometrical
structure and dynamics of the LMC disk and by considering different
configurations for the LMC bar. In this framework it clearly emerges that the
spatial distribution of the events observed so far shows a near--far asymmetry.
This turns out to be compatible with the optical depth calculated for the LMC
halo objects. In this perspective, our main conclusion, supported by a
statistical analysis on the outcome of an evaluation of the microlensing rate,
is that self lensing can not account for all the observed events. Finally we
propose a general inequality to calculate quickly an upper limit to the optical
depth along a line of view through the LMC center.

frame consists of 8 QSO images and 48 galaxies. The absolute proper motion is
mu_alpha cos(delta) = 0.59 +-0.16 mas/yr and mu_delta = -0.15 +- 0.16 mas/yr.
The corresponding orbit of Fornax is polar, with an eccentricity of 0.27, and a
radial period of 4.5 Gyr. Fornax's current location is near pericenter. The
direction of the motion of Fornax supports the notion that Fornax belongs to
the Fornax-LeoI-LeoII-Sculptor-Sextans stream as hypothesized by Lynden-Bell
(1976, 1982) and Majewski (1994).
  According to our orbit determination, Fornax crossed the Magellanic plane
\~190 Myr ago, a time that coincides with the termination of the star-formation
process in Fornax. We propose that ram-pressure stripping due to the passage of
Fornax through a gaseous medium denser than the typical intragalactic medium
left behind from the LMC may have caused the end of star formation in Fornax.
The excess, anomalous clouds within the South Galactic pole region of the
Magellanic Stream whose origin has long been debated in the literature as
constituents of either the Magellanic Stream or of the extragalactic Sculptor
group, are found to lie along the orbit of Fornax. We speculate that these

Such mass scales are relevant for example for dark matter made of primordial
black holes or clumped matter in a sequestered sector. If such dark matter
exists it will be unambiguously detectable through its inelastic gravitational
interaction with the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
experiment. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by studying the dark
matter signal in numerical simulations of the LISA data stream. A more
conservative approach -- to detect dark matter in the differential acceleration
power spectrum -- significantly underestimates the expected rates for LISA.
Interestingly, while the space-density of 1e15 gm DM objects would be
comparable to the space-density of asteroids of similar masses, such ``light
matter'' contaminants are readily detectable in reflected Solar light, allowing
for the elimination of the major background.

the vector has be part of a ``cosmic triad'', that is, a set of three identical
vectors pointing in mutually orthogonal spatial directions. A triad is indeed
able to drive a stage of late accelerated expansion in the universe, and there
exist tracking attractors that render cosmic evolution insensitive to initial
conditions. However, as in most other models, the onset of cosmic acceleration
is determined by a parameter that has to be tuned to reproduce current
observations. The triad equation of state can be sufficiently close to minus
one today, and for tachyonic models it might be even less than that. I briefly
analyze linear cosmological perturbation theory in the presence of a triad. It
turns out that the existence of non-vanishing spatial vectors invalidates the
decomposition theorem, i.e. scalar, vector and tensor perturbations do not
decouple from each other. In a simplified case it is possible to analytically
study the stability of the triad along the different cosmological attractors.
The triad is classically stable during inflation, radiation and matter
domination, but it is unstable during (late-time) cosmic acceleration. I argue
that this instability is not likely to have a significant impact at present.

with an observation of SS 433, the pointing target source. Ser X-1 has been
clearly detected up to 30 keV with unprecedented positional accuracy for
high-energy emission. The 20-30 keV light curve showed substantial variability
during the observation. Comparison with previous observations indicates that
the source was in its high (`banana') state and displayed a soft spectrum
during the INTEGRAL pointing. A (non simultaneous) radio-to-gamma-rays
broad-band spectral energy distribution is also presented for the first time

emission from the candidate HMPOs is bright in comparison to the nearby HII
regions. W48W is a cold dense source, with no radio or mid-infrared emission.
S152SE has an IRAS source IRAS 22566+5828 in the Southwestern part of the
region, which appears in the mid-infrared 8.28micron emission, but there is no
radio emission. The 850micron data shows another core within the region, in the
Northeast. The polarimetry is ordered and the degree of polarisation is high
over the candidate HMPOs - ~6% for W48W and ~8% for S152SE. Polarimetry results
of this nature indicate a strong, ordered magnetic field threading the
candidate HMPOs. The magnetic field direction in both S152SE and W48W is
perpendicular to the direction of elongation of the cloud which would imply

like those in the solar corona, using a large set of ROSAT/PSPC observations of
late-type-stars, and a large set of solar X-ray data collected with Yohkoh/SXT.
We have considered data on the solar corona at various phases of the cycle and
various kinds of X-ray coronal structures, from flares to the background
corona. The surface flux (F_x) vs. spectral hardness ratio (HR) diagram is a
fundamental tool for our study. We find that $F_X$ is strongly correlated to HR
in stellar coronae, in the solar corona at all phases of the cycle, and in the
individual solar coronal structures; all follow the same law. We therefore
claim that coronae of late type stars are formed with X-ray structures very
similar to the solar ones. In this scenario, the fraction of the stellar
surface covered with active regions and with their bright cores increases with
activity; the most active stars are brighter and hotter than if they were
entirely covered with active regions so they can be explained only with the
additional presence of several flares (or flare-like structures) at any time.
Using the F_x vs. HR correlation (F_X ~ T^6) we derive new laws relating the
temperature, pressure, volumetric heating and characteristic loop length of the
coronal plasma, on all the late type stars Individual solar coronal structures
and the whole solar corona, follow the same laws. We claim that the strong
correlation between surface flux and temperature and the laws mentioned above
are just the effect of more fundamental physical mechanisms driving the coronal
structures of all the late-type stars from the emergence of new magnetic
structures to their dissipation.

easier for the array of junctions in the nonzero voltage state to synchronize.

more than one orbital conducting channel becomes available for quantum

go all the way to zero at any value of the SO coupling, some degree of current

effect increases the Arrhenius factor $\exp(-E/kT)$ in the switching rate, not
by lowering the barrier $E$, but by raising the effective spin temperature $T$.

  interaction strengths","23 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables",,"10.1016/j.physa.2004.09.026",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  One distinctive and pervasive aspect of social systems is the fact that they
comprise several kinds of agents. Thus, in order to draw parallels with
physical systems one is lead to consider binary (or multi-component) compounds.
Recent views about the mixing of liquids in solutions gained from neutron and
X-ray scattering show these systems to have a number of similarities with
socio-economic systems. It appears that such phenomena as rearrangement of
bonds in a solution, gas condensation, selective evaporation of molecules can
be transposed in a natural way to socio-economic phenomena. These connections
provide a novel perspective for looking at social systems which we illustrate
through some examples. For instance, we interpret suicide as an escape
phenomenon and in order to test that interpretation we consider social systems
characterized by very low levels of social interaction. For those systems
suicide rates are found to be 10 to 100 times higher than in the general
population. Another interesting parallel concerns the phase transition which
occurs when locusts gather together to form swarms which may contain several
billion insects. What hinders the thorough investigation of such cases from the
standpoint of collective phenomena that we advocate is the lack or inadequacy
of statistical data for, up to now, they were collected for completely
different purposes. Most essential for further progress are statistics which
would permit to estimate the strength of social ties and interactions. Once
adequate data become available, rapid advance may be expected.

elastic solids. The mechanism for energy loss is thermal diffusion caused by
inhomogeneous deformation, flexure in thin plates. The general result is
combined with the Kirchhoff assumption to obtain a new equation for the
flexural vibration of thin plates incorporating thermoelastic loss as a damping
term. The thermal relaxation loss is inhomogeneous and depends upon the local
state of vibrating flexure, specifically, the principal curvatures at a given
point on the plate. Thermal loss is zero at points where the principal
curvatures are equal and opposite, that is, saddle shaped or pure anticlastic
deformation. Conversely, loss is maximum at points where the curvatures are
equal, that is, synclastic or spherical flexure. The influence of modal
urvature on the thermoelastic damping is described through a modal
pparticipation factor. The effect of transverse thermal diffusion on plane wave
propagation is also examined. It is shown that transverse diffusion effects are
always small provided the plate thickness is far greater than the thermal
phonon mean free path, a requirement for the validity of the classical theory
of heat transport. These results generalize Zener's theory of thermoelastic
loss in beams and are useful in predicting mode widths in MEMS and NEMS
oscillators.

results to existing perturbative results in the literature. Our numerical
accuracy allows us to verify and even improve some of the existing perturbative
coefficients by Freedman and McLerran for zero temperature or by Vuorinen for
finite chemical potential and for linear and non-linear quark number
susceptibilities, and to predict new coefficients to the sixth order in the
coupling numerically that have not been calculated analytically yet. For larger
couplings we determine where perturbation theory ceases to be applicable.
  For large chemical potential and small temperatures we enter the range of a
so-called non-Fermi liquid, which in contrast to a classical Fermi liquid is
dominated by long-range quasi-static transverse gauge-boson interactions. In
this limit, we complete the previously known leading $T\ln T^{-1}$ contribution
to the specific heat, and also go beyond this order to find a series involving
anomalous fractional powers $T^{(3+2n)/3}$ caused by dynamical screening. We
calculate their coefficients analytically up to order $T^{7/3}$ and find that
these contributions determine the leading anomalous contribution in full QED

These fluctuations are found to be sensitive to the presence of unstable
resonances, such as $\rho $ and $\omega $ mesons. We predict that the
charge-fluctuation observable $D_{UEM}$ should be restricted to the interval
$8/3\le D_{UEM}\le 4$ depending on the $\rho /\pi $ production ratio. Also, the
isospin fluctuations of the DCC-type of the ratio of neutral-to-charged pions
are suppressed if pions are produced together with $\rho $ mesons.

of the simplest examples of a cosmological singularity in string theory. In
this work, the study of weakly coupled closed strings on this space is pursued
in several directions: (i) physical states in the twisted sectors are found to
come in two kinds: short strings, which wind along the compact space-like
direction in the cosmological (Milne) regions, and long strings, which wind
along the compact time-like direction in the (Rindler) whiskers. The latter can
be viewed as infinitely long static open strings, stretching from Rindler
infinity to a finite radius and folding back onto themselves. (ii) As in the
Schwinger effect, tunneling between these states corresponds to local pair
production of winding strings. The tunneling rate approaches unity as the
winding number $w$ gets large, as a consequence of the singular geometry. (iii)
The one-loop string amplitude has singularities on the moduli space, associated
to periodic closed string trajectories in Euclidean time. In the untwisted
sector, they can be traced to the combined existence of CTCs and Regge
trajectories in the spectrum. In the twisted sectors, they indicate pair
production of winding strings. (iv) At a classical level and in sufficiently
low dimension, the condensation of winding strings can indeed lead to a bounce,
although the required initial conditions are not compatible with Misner
geometry at early times. (v) The semi-classical analysis of winding string pair
creation can be generalized to more general (off-shell) geometries. We show
that a regular geometry regularizes the divergence at large winding number.

feature of this obstruction theory is that it can be computed in concrete terms

  We prove an extension of Shale's theorem connecting symplectic group and Weyl
representation. We show that the `Shale map' respects compositions (This
settles an old conjecture of K. R. Parthasarathy). Using this we associate a
product system to a sum system. This construction includes the exponential
product system of Arveson, as a trivial case, and the type III examples of
Tsirelson.
  By associating a von Neumann algebra to every `elementary set' in [0,1], in a
much simpler and direct way, we arrive at the invariants of the product system
introduced by Tsirelson, given in terms of the sum system. Then we introduce a
notion of divisibility for a sum system, and prove that the examples of
Tsirelson are divisible. It is shown that only type I and type III product
systems arise out of divisible sum systems. Finally, we give a sufficient
condition for a divisible sum system to give rise to a unitless (type III)
product system.

A single step of LR, and a periodic array of alternating steps with opposite

to slow down and eventually halt the soliton by passing it through the step of
increasing reflectivity, thus capturing a pulse of standing light. First, we
develop an analytical approach, assuming adiabatic evolution of the soliton,
and making use of the energy conservation and balance equation for the
momentum. Comparison with simulations shows that the analytical approximation
is quite accurate (unless the inhomogeneity is too steep): the soliton is
either transmitted across the step or bounces back. If the step is narrow,
systematic simulations demontrate that the soliton splits into transmitted and
reflected pulses (splitting of a BG soliton which hits a chirped grating was
observed in experiments). Moving through the periodic ""superstructure"", the
soliton accummulates distortion and suffers radiation loss if the structure is
composed of narrow steps. The soliton moves without any loss or irreversible
deformation through the array of sufficiently broad steps.

important at high excitation energies for stable nuclei and at all excitation
energies for nuclei near the drip lines. This single-particle level density is
subdivided into compound-nucleus and gas components. Two methods were
considered for this subdivision. First in the subtraction method, the
single-particle level density is determined from the scattering phase shifts.
In the Gamov method, only the narrow Gamov states or resonances are included.

approximated by the backshifted Fermi-gas expression with level-density
parameters that are dependent on A, but with very little dependence on the
neutron or proton richness of the nucleus. However, a small decrease in the
level-density parameter was predicted for some nuclei very close to the drip
lines. The largest difference between the calculations using the two methods
was the deformation dependence on the level density. The Gamov method predicts
a very strong peaking of the level density at sphericity for high excitation
energies. This leads to a suppression of deformed configurations and,
consequently, the fission rate predicted by the statistical model is reduced in
the Gamov method.

one to expect that the radiation emitted from each volume element of such a
polarization current will comprise a \v{C}erenkov-like envelope with two sheets
that meet along a cusp. The emission from the experimental machine is in good
agreement with these expectations, the combined effect of the volume elements
leading to tightly-defined beams of a well-defined geometry, determined by the
source speed and trajectory. In addition, over a restricted range of angles, we
detect the presence of cusps in the emitted radiation. These are due to the
detection over a short time period (in the laboratory frame) of radiation
emitted over a considerably longer period of source time. Consequently, the
intensity of the radiation at these angles was observed to decline more slowly
with increasing distance from the source than would the emission from a
conventional antenna. The angular distribution of the emitted radiation and the
properties associated with the cusps are in good {\it quantitative} agreement

  Codes","21 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.comp-ph",,"  The long-term dynamics of many dynamical systems evolve on an attracting,
invariant ""slow manifold"" that can be parameterized by a few observable
variables. Yet a simulation using the full model of the problem requires
initial values for all variables. Given a set of values for the observables
parameterizing the slow manifold, one needs a procedure for finding the
additional values such that the state is close to the slow manifold to some
desired accuracy. We consider problems whose solution has a singular
perturbation expansion, although we do not know what it is nor have any way to
compute it. We show in this paper that, under some conditions, computing the
values of the remaining variables so that their (m+1)-st time derivatives are
zero provides an estimate of the unknown variables that is an mth-order
approximation to a point on the slow manifold in sense to be defined. We then
show how this criterion can be applied approximately when the system is defined
by a legacy code rather than directly through closed form equations.

It is based on second quantization in coupled tensorial form, angular momentum
theory in orbital, spin and quasispin spaces and generalized graphical
technique. All matrix elements (diagonal and non-diagonal with respect to
configurations) differ then only by projections of quasispin of separate shells
and are expressed via completely reduced (in three spaces) matrix elements of
second quantization operator and its products. Thus, all matrix elements are
treated uniformly. This approach allows one to generate fairly accurate

and Kaufherr (PRL, 92, 070404, 2004) revisit the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and
propose non-local exchange of a conserved, gauge invariant quantity that
changes the modular momentum of the particle that is responsible for the AB
phase shift. We suggest that the net angular momentum shifts proposed for GP
may be analogous to the shift in the modulus momentum for the AB effect. At a
