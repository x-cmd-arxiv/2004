We identify 174 X-ray point-sources, of which ~150 are likely LMXBs. This LMXB
catalog is combined with deep F475W and F850LP images taken with ACS on HST to
examine the connection between LMXBs and globular clusters in M87. Of the 1688
globular clusters in our catalog, f_X = 3.6 +- 0.5% contain a LMXB and we find
that the metal-rich clusters are 3 +- 1 times more likely to harbor a LMXB than
their metal-poor counterparts. In agreement with previous findings for other
galaxies, we find that brighter, more metal-rich clusters are more likely to
contain a LMXB. For the first time, however, we are able to demonstrate that
the probability, p_X, that a given cluster will contain a LMXB depends
sensitively on the dynamical properties of the host cluster. Specifically, we
use the HST images to measure the half-light radius, concentration index and
central density, \rho_0, for each globular, and define a parameter, \Gamma,
which is related to the tidal capture and binary-neutron star exchange rate.
Our preferred form for p_X is then p_X \propto \Gamma \rho_0^{-0.42\pm0.11}
(Z/Z_{\odot})^{0.33\pm0.1}. We argue that if the form of p_X is determined by
dynamical processes, then the observed metallicity dependence is a consequence
of an increased number of neutron stars per unit mass in metal-rich globular
clusters. Finally, we find no compelling evidence for a break in the luminosity
distribution of resolved X-ray point sources. Instead, the LMXB luminosity
function is well described by a power law with an upper cutoff at L_X ~ 10^39
erg/s. (abridged)

principle axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. The
systematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to the
virial radius. We argue that the differences in simulations with and without
cooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools and
condenses toward the center, and during major mergers. We perform a series of
high-resolution N-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in major
mergers of DM halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. In the DM halo-only
mergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentum
of the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. However,
significant shape changes in the DM distribution may result if stellar disks
are included. In this case the shape of the DM halos is correlated with the
morphology of the stellar remnants.

(MIR) images and photometry of a sample of nearby LLAGN. All MIR images show
extended emission on small scales (e.g. 90% maximum widths 18 - 106 pc) deep
within the nucleus. Because the profile of this small-scale emission is
inconsistent with the near-IR stellar emission profile, we conclude the MIR
emission is not from the stellar population. Because strong starburst emission
is not reported for our objects, we eliminate this origin as well, and conclude
that the extended component of the MIR emission is most likely due to a warm
dust structure deep in the nucleus, consistent with the gross details of a
Unified Model Torus.
  Because MIR and X-ray flux measurements are very insensitive to the effects
of pure dust extinction, the ratio of MIR and X emission can be used as a
discriminator of emission processes that is insensitive to dust extinction. X
and MIR emission are known to be correlated in quasars and Seyfert galaxies.
Our LLAGN objects follow this correlation with small scatter down to extremely
low luminosity, suggesting that the same continuum emission mechanisms are
present in LLAGN as in Seyferts and quasars. This result suggests that weak UV
emission (relative to other bands) in LLAGN compared to Seyferts and quasars
could be due to dust extinction; it then follows that modifications to standard
AGN continuum emission models for LLAGN (e.g. ADAF accretion) are not required.

spectral range (4000-7500)AA were obtained with the 6 m and 1 m telescopes of
SAO (Russia) and with the 2.1 m telescope GHO (Mexico). We found that both the
flux in the lines and the continuum gradually decreased, reaching minimum
values during May-June 2002. The mean, rms, and the averaged over years,
observed and difference line profiles of H-alpha and H-beta reveal the double
peaked structure at the radial velocity ~+-1000km/s. The relative intensity of
these peaks changes with time. During 1996, the red peak was the brightest,
while in 1998 - 2002, the blue peak became the brighter one. In 2000-2002 a
distinct third peak appeared in the red wing of H-alpha and H-beta line
profiles. The radial velocity of this feature decreased between 2000 and 2002
from ~+2500 km/s to ~+2000 km/s. The fluxes of the various parts of the line
profiles are well correlated with each other and also with the continuum flux.
Shape changes of the different parts of the broad line are not correlated with
continuum variations and, apparently, are not related to reverberation effects.
Changes of the integral Balmer decrement are, on average, anticorrelated with
the continuum flux variations. This is probably due to an increasing role of
collisional excitation as the ionizing flux decreases. Our results favor the
formation of the broad Balmer lines in a turbulent accretion disc with large
and moving ""optically thick"" inhomogeneities, capable of reprocessing the
central source continuum.

described: the standard Northern Arm, Eastern Arm, Bar, Western Arc, and five
additional, coherently-moving patches of gas. From this analysis, the Northern
Arm appears not limited, as usually thought, to the bright, narrow North-South
lane seen on intensity images, but it instead consists of a weak, continuous,
triangular-shaped surface, drawn out into a narrow stream in the vicinity of

realistic treatment of statistical biases and error estimates, as standard

theoretical biases cause the distribution of the observed ages to be very
different from that of the true age distribution of the sample. Our first
results confirm the lack of metal-poor G dwarfs relative to closed-box model
predictions (the ``G dwarf problem''), the existence of radial metallicity
gradients in the disk, the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disk
since its formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, and
the continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency consistent
with that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant molecular clouds.

source into the ISM. The similarity of the jets of this source and jets in
radio galaxies or radio-loud quasars suggests that we should detect
large-scale, synchrotron emitting radio structures surrounding GRS 1915+105.
However, these large structures have not been found. We show that by adapting a
model for the radio lobes of extragalatic jet sources we predict a radio
surface brightness of the equivalent structures of GRS 1915+105 below the
current detection limits. The model uses an energy transport rate of the jets
averaged over the jet lifetime. This transport rate is found to be considerably
lower than the power of the jets during the rare major ejection events. Thus
the lobes contain less energy than would be inferred from these events and
produce a lower radio luminosity. The model also predicts a lifetime of the
jets of order $10^6$ years and a gas density of the ISM in the vicinity of GRS
1915+105 of $\sim 150$ cm$^{-3}$. The impact sites of the jets are identified
with two {\sc iras} regions with a flat radio spectrum located on either side
of GRS 1915+105. Observations of molecular lines and dust emission from these
objects are consistent with our interpretation. Distance estimates for the {\sc
iras} regions give 6.5 kpc and our model implies that this is also the distance
to GRS 1915+105. This low distance estimate in combination with the observed
motions of jet ejections on small scales yields a jet velocity of about 0.7 c
and an angle of $53^{\circ}$ of the jets to our line of sight.

taken in ideal conditions reaching the target depths of U=25.3, B=26.2, V=25.7,

reaching an average depth of K_{5\sigma}~18.5. At present, approximately 23
deg^2 of the ODTS have been observed, with 3.5 deg^2 of the K band survey
completed. This paper details the survey goals, field selection, observation
strategy and data reduction procedure, focusing on the photometric calibration
and catalogue construction. Preliminary photometric redshifts have been
obtained for a subsample of the objects with R <= 23. These results are
presented alongside a brief description of the photometric redshift

be z~0.7 from a combination of the ODTS photometric redshifts and comparison

a function of energy, in contradiction to the energy-independent wavelength
seen by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments in the pseudogap state.
This suggests that the patterns seen in STM local density of states

of some form of ordering.

Their related eigenvalues are usually complex, depending on the network
structure (even without loops). Therefore, their generic behavior is
characterized by oscillations. We also show that regular distribution networks
possess two negative eigenvalues only, but perturbations generate a spectrum of
complex eigenvalues.

injected by ZnMnSe-contacts into a gallium arsenide (GaAs) two-dimensional

the case of no spin-polarized injection of charge carriers into a 2DEG for

of the spin-polarized electrons within the 2DEG on the Hall resistance. In
addition, in our model we expect no coupling between the contact and the 2DEG
for odd filling factors of the 2DEG for 100% spininjection, because of the
opposite sign of the g-factors of ZnMnSe and GaAs.

communication via encryption among sensors deployed in an ad-hoc manner to form
a sensor network. In this paper, we propose a novel 2-Phase technique for key
predistribution based on a combination of inherited and random key assignments
from the given key pool to individual sensor nodes. We also develop an
analytical framework for measuring security-performance tradeoffs of different
key distribution schemes by providing metrics for measuring sensornet
connectivity and resiliency to enemy attacks. In particular, we show
analytically that the 2-Phase scheme provides better average connectivity and
superior $q$-composite connectivity than the random scheme. We then prove that
the invulnerability of a communication link under arbitrary number of node
captures by an adversary is higher under the 2-Phase scheme. The probability of
a communicating node pair having an exclusive key also scales better with
network size under the 2-Phase scheme. We also show analytically that the
vulnerability of an arbitrary communication link in the sensornet to single
node capture is lower under 2-Phase assuming both network-wide as well as
localized capture. Simulation results also show that the number of exclusive
keys shared between any two nodes is higher while the number of $q$-composite
links compromised when a given number of nodes are captured by the enemy is
smaller under the 2-Phase scheme as compared to the random one.

promising for B-decay experiments at hadron colliders, and emphasize the
importance of studies of rare decays, which are absent at the tree level in the

  in periodic Lorentz gas and Sinai billiard","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  We report on the stationary dynamics in classical Sinai billiard (SB)
corresponding to the unit cell of the periodic Lorentz gas (LG) formed by
square lattice of length $L$ and dispersing circles of radius $R$ placed in the
center of unit cell. Dynamic correlation effects for classical particles,
initially distributed by random way, are considered within the scope of
deterministic and stochastic descriptions. A temporal analysis of elastic
reflections from the SB square walls and circle obstacles is given for distinct
geometries in terms of the wall-collision and the circle-collision
distributions. Late-time steady dynamic regimes are explicit in the diffusion
exponent $z(R)$, which plays a role of the order-disorder crossover dynamical
parameter. The ballistic ($z_{0}=1$) ordered motion in the square lattice (R=0)
switches to the superdiffusion regime with $z_{1}=1.5$, which is
geometry-independent when $R<L\sqrt{2}/4$. This observed universal dynamics is
shown to arise from long-distance particle jumps along the diagonal and
nondiagonal Bleher corridors in the LG with the infinite horizon geometry. In
the corresponding SB, this universal regime is caused by the long-time
wall-collision memory effects attributed to the bouncing-ball orbits. The
crossover nonuniversal behavior with $1.5<z<2$ is due to geometry with
$L\sqrt{2}/4\leq R<L/2$, when only the nondiagonal corridors remain open. All
the free-motion corridors are closed in LG with finite horizon ($R\geq L/2$)
and the interplay between square and circle geometries results in the chaotic
dynamics ensured by the normal Brownian diffusion ($z_{2}=2$) and by the normal
Gaussian distribution of collisions.

detect the ""oscillations"" of the dimension at a given point, even when the
local dimension exists, namely local upper and lower dimensions coincide. These

fractals, where they can be explicitly calculated for the canonical limit

with the metric tangential dimensions of the fractal defined in

homogenous) shear turbulence and finally wall bounded turbulence. The main
result of this paper is that for all these flows the polymer stress tensor
attains a universal structure in the limit of large Deborah number $\De\gg 1$.
We present analytic results for the suppression of the coil-stretch transition
at large Deborah numbers. Above the transition the turbulent velocity
fluctuations are strongly correlated with the polymer's elongation: there
appear high-quality ""hydro-elastic"" waves in which turbulent kinetic energy
turns into polymer potential energy and vice versa. These waves determine the
trace of the elastic stress tensor but practically do not modify its universal
structure. We demonstrate that the influence of the polymers on the balance of
energy and momentum can be accurately described by an effective polymer
viscosity that is proportional to to the cross-stream component of the elastic
stress tensor. This component is smaller than the stream-wise component by a
factor proportional to $\De ^2 $. Finally we tie our results to wall bounded
turbulence and clarify some puzzling facts observed in the problem of drag

ultrarelativistic energies. We start with an overview of current experimental
and theoretical issues in Relativistic heavy ion physics. We then introduce
statistical hadronization, and show how it gives a description of particle
abundances and spectra through covariance and entropy maximization. We argue
that a distinction can be made between equilibrated staged freeze-out in which
post-formation hadron interactions play an important role in determining
final-state observables, and non-equilibrium sudden freeze-out where spectra
and abundances get determined at the same time and further interactions are
negligible. We attempt to falsify sudden freeze-out by examining whether
particle abundances and spectra can be described using the same formation
temperature. This is done both in the equilibrium framework, and using a
chemical non-equilibrium ansatz. Our fits to experimental data suggest that the
sudden freeze-out model explains both the particle abundances and spectra. We
then try to extract the particle formation temperature, and quantify
post-freeze-out hadronic interactions using experimentally observable
resonances. We discuss observed resonances and suggest further measurements
that have the potential to distinguish between the possible freeze-out
scenarios experimentally. Finally, we infer from experimental data how particle
formation proceeds in spacetime, in particular whether freeze-out dynamics
agrees with the sudden freeze-out expectation. We examine particle spectra, and
show that they are not sensitive enough to pick the right freeze-out dynamics.
We suggest resonances and azimuthal anisotropy as experimental probes for this
task.

normal transport measurements. For example thermal noise measurement can be
used at sub Kelvin temperature to determine the absolute electron temperature
without applying any heating current. And shot noise measurements helped to
understand the properties of nano and mesoscopic normal metal/superconductor
structures. But at low temperature and for relatively small resistance it is
difficult to measure the sample's noise magnitude because the background
thermal noise can be much larger and usually there are other pick-up noises.
Cross correlation technique is one way to solve this problem. This article
describes an improved cross correlation algorithm that averages in both
frequency and time domain, and the realization of a simple instrument set-up
with PC and sound card. With this set-up it is shown even with much larger
background noise and pickup noises, 100pV/$\sqrt{Hz}$ white noise level can be
easily measured in seconds. Compared to the normally used cross-correlation

  references & many corrections; to be submitted to J. Phys. Chem. A",,,,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Temporal evolution of transient absorption spectra for pre-solvated electron
(e-) generated by biphotonic (200 nm) ionization of liquid H2O and D2O has been
studied on femto- and pico- second time scales. These spectra were obtained in
the intervals of 50 nm between 500 and 1700 nm. Two distinctive regimes of the
spectral evolution were observed. In both of these regimes, the spectral
profile changes considerably with delay time. For t<1ps, two new features (the
1150 nm band and 1400 nm shoulder) were observed in the spectral region where
O-H overtones appear in the spectra of light water. These two features were not
observed for the e- in D2O. Vibronic coupling to the modes of water molecules
lining the solvation cavity is a possible origin of these features. On the
sub-picosecond time scale, the absorption band of e- progressively shifts to
the blue. At later delay times (t> 1ps), the position of the band maximum is
""locked"", but the spectral profile continues to change by narrowing on the red
side and broadening on the blue side; the oscillator strength is constant
within 10%. The time constant of this narrowing is ca. 0.56 ps for H2O and 0.64
ps for D2O, respectively. Vibrational relaxation and time-dependent decrease in
the size and anisotropy of the solvation cavity are suggested as possible
causes for the observed spectral transformations in both of these regimes. The
geminate recombination kinetics for hydrated electrons generated by absorption
of two 200 nm quanta (12.4 eV total energy) in light and heavy water are almost
identical, suggesting that the average separation between the e- and its
geminate partners in D2O is 13% narrower than in H2O. We suggest that
autoionization of water competes with direct ionization even at this high
photoexcitation energy.
