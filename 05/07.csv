variability observed during previous X-ray missions. A measurement of the
radiative efficiency is in excess of what is expected from a Schwarzschild
black hole. In addition to the rapid X-ray variability, the short UV light
curves (< 4 hours) obtained with the Optical Monitor may also show
fluctuations, albeit at much lower amplitude than the X-rays. In general, the
extreme variability is impressive considering that the broad-band (0.4-10 keV
rest-frame) luminosity of the source is ~10^45 erg/s. During at least one of
the observations, the X-ray and UV light curves show common trends, although
given the short duration of the OM observations, and low significance of the UV
light curves it is difficult to comment on the importance of this possible
correlation. Interestingly, the high-energy photons (> 2 keV) do not appear
highly variable. The X-ray spectrum resembles that of many narrow-line Seyfert
1 type galaxies: an intense soft-excess modelled with a multi-colour disc
blackbody, a power-law component, and an absorption line at ~1.4 keV. The ~1.4
keV feature is curious given that it was not detected in previous observations,
and its presence could be related to the strength of the soft-excess. Of
further interest is curvature in the spectrum above ~2 keV which can be
described by a strong reflection component. The strong reflection component,
lack of high-energy temporal variability, and extreme radiative efficiency
measurements can be understood if we consider gravitational light bending
effects close to a maximally rotating black hole.

satisfactorily with the model alone and that there is evidence for nonthermal
X-ray emission, which is particularly important at > 4 keV. The total
unabsorbed 0.1-10 keV luminosities of the eastern and western parts of the
bubble are ~3 10^36 erg/s and ~5 10^36 erg/s, respectively. The unabsorbed
0.1-10 keV luminosity of the bubble model is 4 10^36 erg/s and so the power-law
component contributes between 1/3 and 1/2 to the total unabsorbed luminosity in
this energy band. The nature of the hard nonthermal emission is not clear,
although recent supernovae in the bubble may be responsible. We expect that
about one or two core-collapse supernovae could have occured and are required
to explain the enrichment of the hot gas, as evidenced by the overabundance of
alpha-elements by a factor of 3, compared to the mean value of 0.5 solar for
the interstellar medium in the Large Magellanic Cloud. As in previous studies
of various superbubbles, the amount of energy currently present in 30 Dor C is
significantly less than the expected energy input from the enclosed massive
stars over their lifetime. We speculate that a substantial fraction of the
input energy may be radiated in far-infrared by dust grains, which are mixed
with the hot gas because of the thermal conduction and/or dynamic mixing.

remains at a very low level until the Doppler cone of the beam intersects the
observer's line of sight, making off-axis GRB jets directly detectable only at
long wavelengths and late times. Circumstellar material, however, will Compton
scatter the prompt gamma-ray and afterglow radiation flux and give rise to a
reflection echo. We show that the Compton echo of a misaligned GRB carries an
X-ray luminosity that may exceed by many orders of magnitude that produced by
the underlying subrelativistic SN during the first few weeks. Bright scattering
echoes may therefore provide a means for detecting a population of misaligned

the first time, results based on CIV, MgII, and Hbeta emission lines at
high-redshifts. Assuming gravitationally bound orbits as dominant broad-line
region gas motion, we determine black hole masses in the range of M_bh = 2
times 10^8 M_sun up to M_bh = 4 times 10^10 M_sun. While the black hole mass
estimates based on CIV and Hbeta agree well, MgII typically indicates a factor
of $\sim 5 \times$ lower SMBH masses. A flatter slope of the Hbeta radius -
luminosity relation, a possibly steeper slope of the MgII radius - luminosity
relation, and a slightly larger radius of the MgII BLR than for Hbeta could
relax the discrepancy. In spite of these uncertainties, the CIV, MgII, and
Hbeta emission lines consistently indicate super-massive black hole masses of
several times 10^9 M_sun at redshifts up to z = 5.1. Assuming logarithmic
growth by spherical accretion with a mass to energy conversion efficiency of
epsilon = 0.1 and an Eddington ratio L_bol / L_edd calculated for each quasar
individually, we estimate black hole growth-times of the order of several ~100
Myr which are smaller than the age of the universe at the corresponding
redshift. Assuming high-mass seed black holes (M_bh^seed = 10^3 to 10^5 M_sun)
the SMBHs in the z = 3.5 quasars began to grow at redshifts z > 4, while for
the quasars with z > 4.5 they started at z = 6 to 10. These estimated time
scales for forming SMBHs at high redshifts, together with previous studies
indicating high quasar metallicities, suggest that the main SMBH growth phase
occurs roughly contemporaneously with a period of violent and extensive star
formation in proto-galactic nuclei.

that in the nonlinear regime the dynamical similarity between the IGM and dark

the shocks breaks the IGM into multiple phases. The mean entropy, or the
cosmological entropy floor, is found to be more than 100 h^(-1/3) keV cm^2 in

effective preheating mechanism of the IGM, and probably enough to provide the
entropy excess of clusters and groups if the epoch of the gas falling in
cluster cores is not earlier than z ~ 2 - 3. On the other hand, at redshifts z
< 4, there is always a more than 90% volume of the low dark matter mass density

deflecting matter is concentrated in one lens plane at a certain distance - the
thin lens approximation. However, in a few observed cases, lenses at more than
one redshift have been identified as contributing to the image splitting.
  Here we report on a quantitative investigation of the importance and
frequency of significant multiple lensing agents. We use multi-lens plane
simulations to evaluate how frequently two or more lens planes combined are
essential for multiple imaging, as compared with the cases where a single lens
plane alone provides enough focusing to be supercritical.
  We find that the fraction of cases for which more than one lens plane
contributes significantly to a multi-image lensing situation is a strong
function of source redshift. For sources at redshift unity, 95% of lenses
involve only a single mass concentration, but for a more typical scenario with,
e.g., a source at a redshift of z_s = 3.8, as many as 38% of the strongly
lensed quasars/arcs occur because of a significant matter contribution from one
or more ADDITIONAL lens planes. In the 30% to 40% of cases when additional
planes make a significant contribution, the surface mass density of the primary
lens will be overestimated by about 15% to 20%, if the additional contributions

statistical analysis of sungrazing comets detected over almost eight years of

observed sungrazers belong to the Kreutz group of comets, follows tightly
clumped orbits and break up at $\sim 40 - 4$ solar radii in a well defined
region of space. The material released from these comets could be (after
ionization) an important portion of the inner source of pickup ions (PUIs), as
the local mass flux of the inner source and cometary PUIs seem comparable. We
indicate time intervals during the year when the cometary PUIs could be
observed from a spacecraft on the Earth's orbit (from the end of July until the
end of the year) and show three time intervals when they should be observable
by Ulysses (from its launch time until the end of 1990, from the end of
November 1994 until mid-May 1995 and from February 2001 until the end of July,
2001). We argue that the PUIs from the inner source should include both singly
and doubly charged ions and that this cometary hypothesis alleviates some
difficulties (in particular, the issue of hydrogen deficit) in the
interpretation of the inner source as solar wind neutralized on dust grains
close to the Sun.

accord with previous work, when $d>\min \{\sigma, 2\}$ (and $q_0$ is not too

universality class that is characterized by density correlations at criticality
decaying as $1/r^{d-2+\eta}$ with $\eta = \max \{0, 2-\sigma\}$. But screening
is now algebraic, the charge-charge correlations decaying, in general, only as

interactions between spherical macroions, screened by surrounding microions, in
charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions. The theory describes leading-order
nonlinear response of the microions (counterions, salt ions) to the
electrostatic potential of the macroions and predicts microion-induced
effective many-body interactions between macroions. A linear response
approximation [Phys. Rev. E 62, 3855 (2000)] yields an effective pair potential
of screened-Coulomb (Yukawa) form, as well as a one-body volume energy, which
contributes to the free energy. Nonlinear response generates effective
many-body interactions and essential corrections to both the effective pair
potential and the volume energy. By adopting a random-phase approximation (RPA)
for the response functions, and thus neglecting microion correlations,
practical expressions are derived for the effective pair and triplet potentials
and for the volume energy. Nonlinear screening is found to weaken repulsive
pair interactions, induce attractive triplet interactions, and modify the
volume energy. Numerical results for monovalent microions are in good agreement
with available ab initio simulation data and demonstrate that nonlinear effects
grow with increasing macroion charge and concentration and with decreasing salt
concentration. In the dilute limit of zero macroion concentration,
leading-order nonlinear corrections vanish. Finally, it is shown that nonlinear
response theory, when combined with the RPA, is formally equivalent to the
mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory and that the linear response approximation
corresponds, within integral-equation theory, to a linearized hypernetted-chain
closure.

temperatures results in the formation of distinctive nanowedge islands
supported on a pseudomorphic Fe layer. We propose a model explaining the growth
mode of these wedge-shaped Fe islands. The model is based on the strain
produced in the substrate around each island, by the lattice mismatch between
the film and substrate. Fe adatoms migrate towards the islands due to the
influence of this strain, which is related to the thickness and size of each
island. The adatoms subsequently enter the islands not only through their thin
ends where the island can be only two monolayers thick but on the contrary,
through a vertical climb along the sides of the thicker end, which can be tens
of layers thick. This mode of mass transport is again driven by strain,
corresponding to the energy reduction through movement towards the location
where the interatomic spacing in the island corresponds to the bulk value. A
key element of the model is that misfit dislocations are formed in the lower
layers of the nanowedge, which act as migration channels for the vertical
climb.

polymer coils in contact with a planar hard wall at (colloidal) liquid-gas
coexistence. Using extensive numerical density functional calculations, the
liquid-gas, wall-liquid and wall-gas interfacial free energies are calculated.
The results are inserted into Young's equation to obtain the contact angle
between the liquid-gas interface and the wall. As a function of polymer
fugacity this angle exhibits discontinuities of slope (``kinks'') upon crossing
first-order surface phase transitions located on the gas branch of the bulk
binodal. Each kink corresponds to a transition from n-1 to $n$ colloid layers
adsorbed at the wall, referred to as the n'th layering transition. The
corresponding adsorption spinodal points from n-1 to n layers upon reducing the
polymer fugacity along the bulk binodal were found in a previous study (J. M.
Brader et al. J. Phys.: Cond. Matt., 14: L1, 2002; Mol. Phys., 101: 3349,
2003). Remarkably, we find desorption spinodal points from n to n-1 layers to
be absent upon increasing polymer fugacity at bulk coexistence, and many
branches (containing up to 7 colloid layers) remain metastable. Results for the
first layering binodal and both spinodal branches off-bulk coexistence hint at
a topology of the surface phase diagram consistent with these findings. Both
the order of the transition to complete wetting and whether it is preceded by a
finite or an infinite number of layering transitions remain open questions. We
compare the locations of the first layering binodal line and of the second
layering binodal point at bulk coexistence with recent computer simulation
results by Dijkstra and van Roij (Phys. Rev. Lett., 89: 208303, 2002) and

flat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations
between physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations
of the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime
are removed from physics, and what remains are a set of `intrinsic' relations
between physical fields. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are
derived from both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then
derived from an action principle, and consistency with the minimal coupling
procedure selects an action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a
cosmological constant. This in turn singles out a unique form of spin-torsion
interaction. A new method for solving the field equations is outlined and
applied to the case of a time-dependent, spherically-symmetric perfect fluid. A
gauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially Newtonian
equations. These equations are then applied to the study of cosmology, and to
the formation and properties of black holes. The existence of global solutions
enables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to
a point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is studied in a black hole

Abelian Higgs model with compact gauge field and fundamentally charged matter.
For small quartic Higgs self coupling and finite gauge coupling the model
possesses a first order transition from the confined/symmetric phase to the
deconfined/Higgs phase separated at some hopping parameter $\kappa_c$. Latent
heat and surface tension are obtained in the first order regime. At larger
quartic coupling the first order transition ceases to exist, and the behavior
becomes similar to that known from the London limit. These observations are
complemented by a study of the photon propagator in Landau gauge in the two
different regimes. The problems afflicting the gauge fixing procedure are
carefully investigated. We propose an improved gauge fixing algorithm which
uses a finite subgroup in a preselection/preconditioning stage. The
computational gain in the expensive confinement region is a speed-up factor
around 10. The propagator in momentum space has a non-zero anomalous dimension
in the confined phase whereas it vanishes in the Higgs phase. As far as the
gauge boson propagator is concerned, we find that the radially active Higgs
field provides qualitatively no new effect compared to the radially frozen

TeV scale black holes at the LHC. Similarly, if the scale of supersymmetry
breaking is sufficiently low, then we might expect to see light supersymmetric
particles in the next generation of colliders. If the mass of the
supersymmetric particle is of order a TeV and is comparable to the temperature
of a typical TeV scale black hole, then such sparticles will be copiously
produced via Hawking radiation: The black hole will act as a resonance for
sparticles, among other things. In this paper we compared various signatures
for SUSY production at LHC, and we contrasted the situation where the
sparticles are produced directly via parton fusion processes with the situation
where they are produced indirectly through black hole resonances. We found that
black hole resonances provide a larger source for heavy mass SUSY (squark and
gluino) production than the direct pQCD-SUSY production via parton fusion
processes depending on the values of the Planck mass and blackhole mass. Hence
black hole production at LHC may indirectly act as a dominant channel for SUSY
production. We also found that the differential cross section d\sigma/dp_t for
SUSY production increases as a function of the p_t (up to p_t equal to about 1
TeV or more) of the SUSY particles (squarks and gluinos), which is in sharp
contrast with the pQCD predictions where the differential cross section
d\sigma/dp_t decreases as p_t increases for high p_t about 1 TeV or higher.
This is a feature for any particle emission from TeV scale blackhole as long as
the temperature of the blackhole is very high (~ TeV). Hence measurement of
increase of d\sigma/dp_t with p_t for p_t up to about 1 TeV or higher for final
state particles might be a useful signature for blackhole production at LHC.

level with the CLEO data on the $\pi\gamma$ transition--and (ii) analytic
perturbation theory at the level of parton amplitudes for hadronic reactions.
The computation of F_{\pi}(Q^2) within this approach is performed at NLO of QCD
perturbation theory (standard and analytic), including the evolution of the
pion distribution amplitude at the same order. We consider the NLO corrections
to the form factor in the \bar{MS} scheme with various renormalization scale
settings and also in the \alpha_V-scheme. We find that using standard
perturbation theory, the size of the NLO corrections is quite sensitive to the
adopted renormalization scheme and scale setting. The main results of our
analysis are the following: (i) Replacing the QCD coupling and its powers by
their analytic images, both dependencies are diminished and the predictions for
the pion form factor are quasi scheme and scale-setting independent. (ii) The
magnitude of the factorized pion form factor, calculated with the
aforementioned pion distribution amplitude, is only slightly larger than the
result obtained with the asymptotic one in all considered schemes. (iii)
Including the soft pion form factor via local duality and ensuring the Ward
identity at Q^2=0, we present predictions that are in remarkably good agreement
with the existing experimental data both in trend and magnitude.

cosmic censorship. Because of backscattering from the geometry, plane wave
modes have a divergent stress tensor at the event horizon, but suitable
wavepackets avoid this difficulty, and are dominated at late times by
quasinormal behavior. The wavepackets have cuts in the complexified coordinate
plane that are controlled by requirements of continuity, single-valuedness and
positive energy. Due to a focusing effect, regular wavepackets nevertheless
have a divergent stress-energy at the inner horizon, signaling an instability.
This instability, which is localized behind the event horizon, is detected
holographically as a breakdown in the semiclassical computation of dual CFT
expectation values in which the analytic behavior of wavepackets in the
complexified coordinate plane plays an integral role. In the dual field theory,
this is interpreted as an encoding of physics behind the horizon in the
entanglement between otherwise independent CFTs.

cosmology for relativistic matter on the branes, but not for non-relativistic
matter. In this case, the Hubble parameter H becomes independent of y to first
order in matter density. This result holds also when an arbitrary number of

compared with the Randall Sundrum phenomenology with a scalar field in the bulk

non-relativistic matter is accommodated by allowing the distance between the

transformations is however explicitly broken by anomalies: The electromagnetic
coupling of the string to the two-form gauge field of the tensor multiplet
suffers from a classical anomaly, and there is also a one-loop quantum anomaly
from the chiral fermions on the string world-sheet. Both of these contributions
are proportional to the Euler class of the normal bundle of the string
world-sheet, and consistency of the model requires that they cancel. This
imposes strong constraints on possible models, which are found to obey an
ADE-classification. We then consider the decoupled world-sheet theory that

pressure goes to zero at late times like $\exp(-\alpha t)$; $\alpha$ is a
function of the number of fivebranes and of the angular momentum of the

the decay of the D-brane into closed string radiation. We propose that in our

for radial motions of the D-brane deep inside the throat, the rolling process
is described by an exactly solvable worldsheet conformal field theory.

intermediate-well, and deep-well potentials, we find KAM tori and Aubry-Mather
sets to prove that one obtains mostly quasiperiodic dynamics for condensate
wave functions of sufficiently large amplitude, where the minimal amplitude
depends on the experimentally adjustable BEC parameters. We show that this
threshold scales with the square root of the inverse of the two-body scattering
length, whereas the rotation number of tori above this threshold is
proportional to the amplitude. As a consequence, one obtains the same dynamical
picture for lattices of all depths, as an increase in depth essentially only
affects scaling in phase space. Our approach is applicable to periodic
superlattices with an arbitrary number of rationally dependent wave numbers.

round a player of population 1 is paired with a member of population 2. The
game is symmetric, and each player tries to obtain an advantageous deal, but
when one of them pushes too hard, no deal at all can be concluded, and they
both loose. The game has many equilibria, and which of them is reached depends
on the history of the interactions as the players evolve according to a fitness
function that measures their gains across the interactions. We can then break
the symmetry by assigning different strategy spaces to the populations, varying
in particular with respect to the information available to the agents. The
agents can, for example, adapt to the behavior of their opponents met in
previous rounds, or they can try to copy the strategies of their successful
friends. It turns out that, in general, the more restricted strategy spaces,
that is, those that utilize less information, are more advantageous for a
population as a whole as their adoption drives the equilibrium in a direction
advantageous to that population. One reason is that a simpler strategy can be
learned faster in an evolutionary setting, another is that it is good for a
population to have some individuals that are unfit in the sense that they make
offers that are individually unsuccessful, but have a systematic effect on the
strategies of their opponents. All these effects are demonstrated through
systematic simulations.

production in central $Au+Au$ collisions and their absence in $d+Au$ collisions
at RHIC have confirmed the long predicted phenomenon of jet quenching in
high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Detailed analyses of the experimental data
also show parton energy loss as the mechanism for the discovered jet quenching.
Using a pQCD parton model that incorporates medium modified parton
fragmentation functions and comparing to experimental data from deeply
inelastic scattering off nuclei, one can conclude that the initial gluon
(energy) density of the hot matter produced in central $Au+Au$ collisions that
causes jet quenching at RHIC is about 30 (100) times higher than in a cold $Au$
nucleus. Combined with data on bulk and collective properties of the hot
matter, the observed jet quenching provides strong evidence for the formation
of a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma in central $Au+Au$ collisions at
RHIC.

of the Italian Telemetered Seismic Network in 1985-2002 by defining basic
significant parameters and studying their evolution during the years. Then, we
deal with the geological methods used to characterise or to plan a seismic
station deployment in a few cases. Last, we define the gain of the network as
the percentage of located earthquakes with respect to the total recorded
earthquakes. By analysing the distribution of non-located (""missed"")
earthquakes, we suggest possible actions to take in order to increase the gain.
Results show that completeness magnitude is 2.4 in the average over the
analysed period, and it can be as low as 2.2 when we consider non-located
earthquakes as well. Parameters such as the distance between an earthquake and
the closest station, and the RMS location decrease with time, reflecting
improvements in the location quality. Methods for geologic and seismological
characterisation of a possible station site also proved to be effective.
Finally, we represent the number of missed earthquakes at each station, showing
that nine stations control more that 50% of all missed earthquakes, and
suggesting areas in Italy where the network might be easily improved.
