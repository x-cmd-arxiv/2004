provide a model, that identifies and explains the origin of the QPOs and how
they are imprinted on the properties of power-law flux component. We argue the
existence of a bounded compact coronal region which is a natural consequence of
the adjustment of Keplerian disk flow to the innermost sub-Keplerian boundary
conditions near the central object and that ultimately leads to the formation
of a transition layer (TL) between the adjustment radius and the innermost
boundary. The model predicts two phases or states dictated by the photon
upscattering produced in the TL: (1) hard state, in which the TL is optically
thin and very hot (kT ~ 50 keV) producing photon upscattering via thermal
Componization; the photon spectrum index Gamma~1.7 for this state is dictated
by gravitational energy release and Compton cooling in an optically thin shock
near the adjustment radius; (2) a soft state which is optically thick and
relatively cold (kT~5 keV); the index for this state, Gamma~2.8 is determined
by soft-photon upscattering and photon trapping in converging flow into BH.

mantle debris that coalesced to form the Moon. But where did this Mars-sized

Earth on a zero-energy parabolic trajectory. But how could such a large object
form in the disk of planetesimals at 1AU without colliding with the Earth

stable orbit among debris at the Earth's Lagrange point $L_4$ (or $L_5$). We
show such a configuration is stable, even for a Mars-sized impactor. It could
grow gradually by accretion at $L_4$ (or $L_5$), but eventually gravitational
interactions with other growing planetesimals could kick it out into a chaotic
creeping orbit which we show would likely cause it to hit the Earth on a

fills the nebula interior, and corresponds well with structures seen in the

The emission from the interior of the PWN, including the pulsar, jet, and

at 2.7-3.4 millimeter is well-fit by a pure envelope model down to the
sensitivity of the interferometer without introducing a disk/compact source, in
contrast to what is seen for other protostars. A velocity gradient in the
densest material is traced by HCN, CS and N2H+, and is perpendicular to the
large-scale CO outflow, with a pattern consistent with rotation around a 1
solar mass central object. Velocity gradients in the propagation direction of
the outflow suggest a clear interaction between the outflowing material and
""quiescent"" core. The C18O observations are fit with a ""drop"" abundance profile
where CO is frozen-out in a region of the envelope with temperatures lower than
40 K and densities higher than 1.5e5 cm^{-3}, which is also required to
reproduce single-dish observations. The N2H+ emission strongly resembles that
of NH3 and is found to be absent toward the central continuum source. This is a
direct consequence of the high CO abundances in the inner region as illustrated
by a chemical model for the L483 envelope. The observed CN emission forms a
spatial borderline between the outflowing and quiescent material probed by,
respectively, HCO+ and N2H+, and also shows intermediate velocities compared to
these two species. A scenario is suggested in which CN is enhanced in the walls
of an outflow cavity due to the impact of UV irradiation either from the

Carlo modelling with aligned oblate grains is used to probe the structure of
the circumstellar envelope and the magnetic field, as well as the dust
properties. At J band the source shows a centrosymmetric pattern dominated by
scattered light. In the H and K bands the central source becomes visible and
its polarisation appears to be dominated by dichroic extinction, with a
position angle inclined by ~40 degrees to the disc axis. The polarisation
pattern of the environs on scales up to 200 AU is consistent with the same
dichroic extinction signature superimposed on the centrosymmetric scattering
pattern. These data can be modelled with a magnetic field which is twisted on
scales from tens to hundreds of AU, or alternatively by a field which is
globally misaligned with the disc axis. A unique solution to the field
structure will require spatially resolved circular polarisation data. The best
fit Monte Carlo model indicates a shallow near infrared extinction law. When
combined with the observed high polarisation and non-negligible albedo these
constraints can be fitted with a grain model involving dirty water ice mantles
in which the largest particles have radii slightly in excess of 1 um. The best
fit model has an envelope structure which is slightly flattened on scales up to
several hundred AU. Both lobes of the bipolar outflow cavity contain a
substantial optical depth of dust (not just within the cavity walls). Curved,
approximately parabolic, cavity walls fit the data better than a conical
cavity. The small inner accretion disc observed at millimetre wavelengths is
not seen at this spatial resolution.

for Gamma-ray bursts, nearly half of the internally dissipated magnetic energy

converted into the kinetic energy of the outflow. Consequently, at the end of
the $\gamma-$ray burst, $\sigma$ decreases significantly ($\sigma\sim 1$ or
even smaller). We numerically investigate the very early reverse shock emission
powered by such mildly magnetized outflows interacting with medium--uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or stellar wind (WIND). We show that for
$\sigma\sim0.05-1$ and typical parameters of Gamma-ray bursts, both the
ISM-ejecta interaction and the WIND-ejecta interaction can power very strong
optical emission ($m_{\rm R}\sim 10-12{\rm th}$ magnitude or even brighter).
Similar to the very early afterglow powered by the non-magnetized ejecta
interacting with the external medium, the main difference between the
ISM-ejecta interaction case and the WIND-ejecta interaction case is that,
before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta, the R-band emission flux increases
rapidly for the former, but for the latter it increases only slightly. (The
abstract has been shortened). We suggest that the linear polarization detection
of the early multi-wavelength afterglow is highly needed to see whether the

pulsational history of evolutionary structures with metallicity Z=0.0004,
finding that He-burning pulsators are expected only outside the mass interval ~
0.8-1.7 Mo. The dependence on metal content of this scenario has been
investigated over the range Z=0.0002 to 0.008. One finds that the edges of the
pulsational strip for the more massive class of pulsators appear independent of
metallicity, but with the minimum mass of these bright pulsators which
decreases when decreasing the metallicity, thus decreasing the predicted
minimum luminosity and period. Comparison with data for Cepheids in Leo A and
in the moderately metal rich extragalactic stellar system Sextans A discloses
an encouraging agreement with the predicted pulsational scenario. On this
basis, we predict that in a stellar system where both RR Lyrae stars and
Cepheids are observed, their magnitude difference may help in constraining both
the metal content and the distance. The current classification of metal-poor

so-called type C (according to the classification of Remillard and
collaborators), which corresponds to a strong 0.1-6 Hz LFQPO, found to be
present during at least 17 observations. We find that the frequency of the QPO
is better correlated with the soft X-ray (< 7 keV) flux than with the hard flux
(> 7 keV). If soft X-rays represent the behavior of an accretion disk, the
relation shows that the disk may set the LFQPO frequency. In two cases, the
identification of the type of QPO is not straightforward. If the QPOs in those
two cases are type A (or B), then we may be seeing the QPO type alternate
between type C and type A (or B), and this may represent some rapid changes in
the physical properties of the accretion flow, before the system stabilizes and
slowly decays toward the end of the outburst. On the other hand, if all the
QPOs are of type C, we may be observing an inversion in the frequency vs. flux
relation, similar to that seen in GRO J1655-40. We discuss the QPO behavior in

for distributions has generically finite-dimensional asymptotics. Such systems
are apparent in many areas of biology, physics (the theory of parametric wave
interaction), chemistry and economics. This conservation of support has a
biological interpretation: inheritance. The finite-dimensional asymptotics
demonstrates effects of ""natural"" selection. Estimations of the asymptotic
dimension are presented. After some initial time, solution of a kinetic
equation with conservation of support becomes a finite set of narrow peaks that
become increasingly narrow over time and move increasingly slowly. It is
possible that these peaks do not tend to fixed positions, and the path covered
tends to infinity as t goes to infinity. The drift equations for peak motion
are obtained. Various types of distribution stability are studied: internal
stability (stability with respect to perturbations that do not extend the
support), external stability or uninvadability (stability with respect to
strongly small perturbations that extend the support), and stable realizability
(stability with respect to small shifts and extensions of the density peaks).
Models of self-synchronization of cell division are studied, as an example of
selection in systems with additional symmetry. Appropriate construction of the
notion of typicalness in infinite-dimensional space is discussed, and the

higher peak being the conventional plasmon. A key feature of our results is a
nontrivial power law dependence, involving the Luttinger Liquid exponents, of
the dependence of the Raman cross sections on the difference of the laser

problem onto a non-commuting RH problem. The method is non-perturbative, quite
general and can be used to compute the Fermi gas response in driven (out of
equilibrium) as well as equilibrium systems. We illustrate the power of the
method by rederiving standard results for the core-hole and open-line Greens
functions for the equilibrium Fermi edge singularity (FES) problem. We then
show that the case of the non-separable potential can be solved
non-perturbatively with no more effort than for the separable case. We compute
the corresponding results for a biased (non-equilibrium) model tunneling
device, similar to those used in single photon detectors, in which a photon
absorption process can significantly change the conductance of the barrier. For
times much larger than the inverse bias across the device, the response of the
Fermi gases in the two electrodes shows that the equilibrium Fermi edge
singularity is smoothed, shifted in frequency and becomes
polarity-dependent.These results have a simple interpretation in terms of known
results for the equilibrium case but with (in general complex-valued)
combinations of elements of the scattering matrix replacing the equilibrium
phase shifts. We also consider the shot noise spectrum of a tunnel junction
subject to a time-dependent bias and demonstrate that the calculation is
essentially the same as for the FES problem. For the case of a periodically
driven device we show that the noise spectrum for the Coherent States of

approximation (CPA) decoupling for the on-site Coulomb repulsion. This
decoupling combined with the modified Hartree-Fock approximation for the
inter-site interactions generates the change in shape of the spin bands with
growing interaction constants, which is described by the correlation factors
and which decreases the kinetic energy of the system. The effective Hartree
field and the gain in kinetic energy due to the on-site and inter-site
correlation factors drive the antiferromagnetism. The on-site and inter-site
interactions act together towards the antiferromagnetism. Their cooperation
decreases the interaction constants required for the antiferromagnetic
ordering. This new approach allows for the antiferromagnetic instability in the
purely itinerant model at the half-filling in the split band limit. This
situation describes the high temperature superconducting cuprates.

can be more interesting in general relativity than in Newtonian gravity.

"hep-ph/0405190","Alan R. White","Alan R. White","Sextet Quark Physics at the Tevatron ?","10 pages, 2 figures",,,"ANL-HEP-PR-04-47","hep-ph",,"  A sextet quark sector of QCD, together with the sextet higgs mechanism, would
produce a major change in the strong interaction above the electroweak scale.
This change may already be evident in Cosmic Ray physics and, if so, dramatic
effects are to be expected at the LHC. In this paper we discuss whether
evidence for the sextet sector could be seen at the Tevatron.
  A major consequence of the connection between QCD and electroweak symmetry
breaking is the strong coupling of the pomeron to the electroweak sector. At
the Tevatron, the energy is too low to produce vector boson pairs directly via
double pomeron exchange, but a number of small cross-section effects could be
seen in diffractive, and diffractive related, processes involving $W^{\pm}$ and
$Z^0$ vector bosons. Probably, the most important feature that could be
decisively established is that the production cross-section for $W^+W^-$ and
$Z^0Z^0$ pairs has an anomalous component with event characteristics different
from the Standard Model. This would be the first indication of what should
become a dominant, very large, cross-section at the LHC.
  If the sextet quark dynamical mass scale is well above the top quark mass,
then the production properties of $W$'s and $Z$'s could be the only new physics
visible at the Tevatron scale. If this scale is lower the situation could be
more subtle. The observed $t\bar{t}$ events could originate from the $\eta_6$ -
the ``sextet higgs'', even though they can be understood perturbatively. The
interpretation of the top quark mass would, however, be different and
non-perturbative decay modes should also be seen. A jet excess at large $E_T$
would provide supporting evidence for this picture, since $\alpha_s$ evolution

generalized statement of the AdS/CFT conjecture has therefore emerged in which,
in addition to string energies corresponding to gauge theory anomalous
dimensions, an infinite tower of higher charges on each side of the duality
should also be equated. Demonstrations of this larger equivalence have been
successful in certain regimes. To test this correspondence in a more stringent
setting, the bosonic sector of the fully quantized string theory on AdS_5 x S^5
is expanded about the pp-wave limit to sextic order in fields, or to O(1/J^2),
where J is the (large) angular momentum of string states boosted along an
equatorial geodesic in the S^5 subspace. To avoid issues of renormalization,
the analysis is restricted to zeroth order in the modified 't Hooft coupling
where consistency conditions demand that integrability be realized. The string
theory, however, fails to meet these conditions. This signals a potential
problem with higher-order corrections in the large-J expansion around the

Instead of flipping a 2-strand tangle, one flips a many-string tangle to
produce a generalized mutant. In the presence of rotational symmetry in that
tangle, the result is called a ""rotant"". We show that if a rotant is
sufficiently simple, then its Jones polynomial agrees with that of the original
link. As an application, this provides a method of generating many examples of
links with the same Jones polynomial, but different Alexander polynomials.
Various other knot polynomials, as well as signature, are also invariant under
such moves, if one imposes more stringent conditions upon the symmetries.
Applications are also given to polynomials of satellites and symmetric knots.

commoners only marry other commoners. The origin of class endogamy, and of
social stratification in general, is a major open question in archaeology. This
paper implements a verbal model proposed by Marcus and Flannery as a class of
agent-based computer models by generalizing and simplifying a mathematical
model of marriage markets developed by Burdett and Coles. One force that can
produce class endogamy occurs if agents are only willing to marry suitors
having status no less than some fixed value below the status of their
highest-status suitor, which they can learn. Another such force results if
children inherit the average of their parents' statuses. In contrast, status
achieved over an agent's lifetime can be viewed as noise, analogous to mutation
in biological evolution. I propose that class endogamy may have resulted from
the interaction of forces such as these, along with other factors such as
ideology. Simulation results are presented, and potential areas for future
research are sketched out. The validity of these models for any particular
culture depends, of course, on whether these forces were actually operating in
that society.

The latter allows us to calculate graphically the irreducible tensorial

formulate additional rules for operations with diagrams. The additional rules
allow us to find graphically the normal form of the complicated tensorial

calculation of the local density of modes using a Green's function approach.
  The results for the Casimir acoustic pressure are generalized to a
sphere/plate configuration using the proximity theorem

show that for an `abelian' superselection rule (exemplified by particle

still holds. For the non-abelian case (exemplified by angular momentum
conservation) the security trade-off can be more subtle, which we illustrate by
showing that if the bit-commitment is forced to be ancilla-free an
asymptotically secure quantum bit commitment is possible.

efficient linear optics quantum computing [Nature 409,46--52, 2001], error rate
thresholds for erasure errors caused by imperfect photon detectors using a 7
qubit code are derived and verified through simulation. A novel method -- based
on a Markov chain description of the erasure correction procedure -- is
developed and used to calculate the recursion relation describing the error
rate at different encoding levels from which the threshold is derived, matching
threshold predictions by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn [quant-ph/0006120, 2000].
In particular, the erasure threshold for gate failure rate in the same order as
the measurement failure rate is found to be above 1.78%.

other qudit, at least indirectly. We demonstrate that the only class of
finite-dimensional entangling Hamiltonians that aren't universal for simulation
is the class of entangling Hamiltonians on qubits whose Pauli operator
expansion contains only terms coupling an odd number of systems, as identified
by Bremner et. al. [Phys. Rev. A, 69, 012313 (2004)]. We show that in all other

Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a double-well potential. By applying the
Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we show that the problem is exactly solvable
as long as the number of excitations due to atom-atom interactions remains low.
In particular, the condensate constitutes a symmetric Gaussian system, thereby
enabling its entanglement of formation to be measured directly by the
fluctuations in the quadratures of the two constituent components [Giedke {\it
et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 107901 (2003)]. We discover that
significant two-mode squeezing occurs in the condensate if the interspecies
interaction is sufficiently strong, which leads to strong entanglement between
the two components.
