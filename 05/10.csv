partial-covering phenomenon. The second longer observation once again displays
a sharp (< 200 eV) spectral drop above 7 keV; however, in contrast to the first
observation, the edge depth and energy have changed significantly. In addition
to changes in the edge parameters, the high-energy spectrum appears steeper.
The changes in the high-energy continuum can be adequately explained in terms
of a partial-covering absorber outflowing from the central region. The
low-energy spectrum also shows significant long-term spectral variability,
including: a substantial increase in the disc temperature; detection of a ~0.9
keV emission feature; and the presence of warm absorption that was also
detected during the ASCA mission, but not seen during the first XMM-Newton
observation. The large increase in disc temperature, and more modest rise in
luminosity, can be understood if we consider the slim-disc model for 1H
0707-495. In addition, the higher disc luminosity could be the driving force
behind the outflow scenario and the re-appearance of a warm medium during the
second XMM-Newton observation.

modeled with a set of rings in a least-squares sense, allowing for the effects
of beam-smearing and line-of-sight projection. The feasibility of the technique
is demonstrated by applying it to good quality HI XV diagrams of eight edge-on
spirals. For seven additional spirals the XV diagrams are of insufficient
quality, and the HI rotational velocities derived earlier using the
envelope-tracing method are retained. The HI results are augmented with the
optical emission line (HII) kinematics to arrive at estimates of the full
rotation curves. A detailed comparison of the HI and HII kinematics shows that
the discs in our sample are sufficiently transparent at the heights above the
plane where we have taken our optical spectra to derive the stellar kinematics.
In several of these spirals the HII is mainly confined to spiral arms and does
not extend out to the edge of the HI layer, which may have caused the HII
velocity profiles to be significantly narrower than those of the HI.

old rotation-powered pulsars with XMM-Newton in order to probe and identify the
origin of their X-radiation. The X-ray emission from these old pulsars is
largely dominated by non-thermal processes. None of the observed spectra
required adding a thermal component consisting of either a hot polar cap or
surface cooling emission to model the data. The X-ray spectrum of PSR 0950+08
is best described by a single power law of photon-index
1.93^{+0.14}_{-0.12}.Taking optical data from the VLT FORS1 into account a
broken power law model is found to describe the pulsar's broadband spectrum
from the optical to the X-ray band. Temperature upper limits for possible
contributions from a heated polar cap or the whole neutron star surface are
T_{pc} < 0.87 x10^6 K and T_s < 0.48 x 10^6 K, respectively. We also find that
the X-ray emission from PSR 0950+08 is pulsed with two peaks per rotation
period. The phase separation between the two X-ray peaks is ~144 degree. The
main radio peak and the trailing X-ray peak are almost phase aligned. The
fraction of X-ray pulsed photons is ~30%. A phase-resolved spectral analysis
confirms the non-thermal nature of the pulsed emission. Detailed pulse profile
simulations constrain the pulsar's emission geometry to be that of an almost
orthogonal rotator. The spectral emission properties observed for PSR 0823+26
are similar to those of PSR 0950+08. For PSR J2043+2740 we report the first
detection of X-ray emission. A power law spectrum, or a combination of a
thermal and a power law spectrum all yield acceptable descriptions of its X-ray
spectrum. No X-ray pulses are detected from PSR J2043+2740. A pulsed fraction

comptonized by a hot plasma at 50 kev thereby producing a hard tail which

neutron star systems using a temperature - luminosity relation. If a given
X-ray source is characterized by a low bolometric luminosity and a relatively
high color blackbody temperature (>1 kev) it has necessarily to be a neutron
star rather than a black hole. From these arguments it is shown that the area
of the soft photon source must be small (r ~ 1 km) and that the accretion disk,
if present, must be truncated very far from the compact object. Here we report
on the possible existence of a cyclotron line around 30 kev. The presence of a

compared to the well-known VLA case, and the larger array designs apply to
arrays currently under design such as LOFAR, ATA, and the SKA. In the initial
implementation of our framework we evaluate designs with respect to two
metrics, array imaging performance and the length of cable necessary to connect
the stations. Imaging performance is measured by the degree to which the
sampling of the uv plane is uniform. For the larger arrays we find that
well-known geometric designs perform well and occupy the Pareto front of
optimum solutions. For the 27-element case we find designs, combining features
of the well-known designs, that are more optimal as measured by these two
metrics. The results obtained by the multiobjective genetic optimization are
corroborated by simulated annealing, which also reveals the role of entropy in
array optimization. Our framework is general, and may be applied to other
design goals and issues, such as particular schemes for sampling the uv plane,
array robustness, and phased deployment of arrays.

lattice in a rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensate in three dimensions,
taking into account the elastic energy of the lattice and the vortex line
bending energy. As in two dimensions, the vortex lattice supports Tkachenko and
gapped sound modes. In contrast, in three dimensions the Tkachenko mode
frequency at long wavelengths becomes linear in the wavevector for any
propagation direction out of the transverse plane. We compute the correlation
functions of the vortex displacements and the superfluid order parameter for a
homogeneous Bose gas of bounded extent in the axial direction. At zero
temperature the vortex displacement correlations are convergent at large
separation, but at finite temperatures, they grow with separation. The growth
of the vortex displacements should lead to observable melting of vortex
lattices at higher temperatures and somewhat lower particle number and faster
rotation than in current experiments. At zero temperature a system of large
extent in the axial direction maintains long range order-parameter correlations
for large separation, but at finite temperatures the correlations decay with
separation.

explains several unusual features of the martensitic transformation. This model
includes inertial effects, dissipation, long-range interaction between the

lattice defects which serves as nucleation centers. Both single-site nucleation
and multi-site nucleation has been studied for single quench situation and
thermal cycling. The final stage morphologies of single-site nucleation and
multi-site nucleation bear considerable similarity suggesting that the initial
distribution of the defects is not important. Thermal cycling using continuous
cooling and heating simulations show the existence of hysteresis in the
transformation. More importantly, the rate of energy dissipated occurs in the
forms of bursts with power law statistics for their amplitudes and durations
which explains the results of acoustic emission signals observed in
experiments. When the system is cycled repeatedly in a restricted domain of
temperatures, the dissipated bursts of energy are repetitive, a feature
observed in experiments. The associated morphology shows a complete reversal of
the martensite domains thus throwing light on the mechanism underlying the
shape memory effect. The model also exhibits tweed like patterns.

NP-complete to test whether a given triangulated model can be represented as a

models into few long strips. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for
creating a single triangle loop or strip from a triangulated model. Our method
applies a dual graph matching algorithm to partition the mesh into cycles, and
then merges pairs of cycles by splitting adjacent triangles when necessary. New
vertices are introduced at midpoints of edges and the new triangles thus formed
are coplanar with their parent triangles, hence the visual fidelity of the
geometry is not changed. We prove that the increase in the number of triangles
due to this splitting is 50% in the worst case, however for all models we
tested the increase was less than 2%. We also prove tight bounds on the number
of triangles needed for a single-strip representation of a model with holes on
its boundary. Our strips can be used not only for efficient rendering, but also
for other applications including the generation of space filling curves on a

for linear x-dependent RR field strengths. This vertex plays a role in studying

of topological-charge anomalies in supersymmetric theories, by extensive use of
a superfield supercurrent. For domain walls quantum modifications of the
supercharge algebra arise not only from the short-distance anomaly but also
from another source of long-distance origin, induced spin in the domain-wall
background, and the latter dominates in the sum. A close look into the
supersymmetric trace identity, which naturally accommodates the central-charge
anomaly and its superpartners, shows an interesting consequence of the
improvement of the supercurrent: Via an improvement the anomaly in the central
charge can be transferred from induced spin in the fermion sector to an induced
potential in the boson sector. This fact reveals a dual character, both
fermionic and bosonic, of the central-charge anomaly, which reflects the
underlying supersymmetry. The one-loop superfield effective action is also
constructed to verify the anomaly and BPS saturation of the domain-wall
spectrum.

expansion rates cause charge migration to the surface of the Q-ball,
corresponding to a non-homogeneous internal rotation frequency. We argue that
this is an important phenomenon as it leads to a large surface charge and
possible fragmentation of the Q-ball. We also explore the deviation of the
Q-ball profile function from the static case. By introducing a parameter
$\epsilon$, which is the ratio of the Hubble parameter to the frequency of
oscillation of the Q-ball field, and using solutions to an analytically
approximated equation for the profile function, we determine the dependence of
the new features on the expansion rate. This allows us to gain an understanding
of when they should be considered and when they can be neglected, thereby
placing restrictions on the existence of homogeneous Q-balls in expanding
backgrounds.

to be due to an interference between the elastic scattering and $2n$-transfer

strongly dominates over the sequential transfer and thus confirms the dominance
of 2$n-^4$He configuration over the $n-^5$He one in the $^6$He wave function.

1) A shift of the NMR frequency in an external electric field applied to the
solid. The value of the shift is about \Delta \nu_1 ~ 10^{-5} Hz with E = 10
kV/cm; 2) A splitting of the NMR line into two lines. The second effect is
independent of the external electric field. The value of the splitting is about
\Delta \nu_2 ~ 0.5 Hz and it depends on the orientation of the crystal with
respect to magnetic field. Both estimates are presented for a magnetic field of
