fully accounted for by mass accreted by X-ray selected AGNs, with bolometric
corrections indicated by current observations and a standard mass-to-light
conversion efficiency \epsilon ~10%. The analysis of the accretion history
highlights that the most massive BHs accreted their mass faster and at higher
redshifts (z>1.5), while the lower mass BHs responsible for most of the hard
X-ray background have mostly grown at z<1.5. The accreted mass function matches
the local SMBH mass function if \epsilon ~0.09(+0.04,-0.03) and the Eddington
ratio \lambda=L/L_Edd \~0.3(+0.3,-0.1) (68% confidence errors). The visibility
time, during which AGNs are luminous enough to be detected by the currently
available X-ray surveys, ranges from ~0.1 Gyr for present day BH masses
M_BH(z=0) ~10^6 M_sun to ~0.3 Gyr for M_BH(z=0) >= 10^9 M_sun. The mass
accreted during luminous phases is >= 25-30% even if we assume extreme values
of \epsilon (\epsilon \~0.3-0.4). An unlikely fine tuning of the parameters
would be required to account for the local SMBH mass function accomodating a

significant. Here we examine in detail some likely sources of systematic
uncertainties which may resolve the differences between the two determinations.
We conclude that the observational determination of the primordial helium
abundance is completely limited by systematic errors and that these systematic
errors have not been fully accounted for in any published observational
determination of the primordial helium abundance. In principle, the observed
metal-poor HII region spectra should be analyzed in a non-parametric way, such
that the HII region physical conditions and the helium abundance are derived
solely from the relative flux ratios of the helium and hydrogen emission lines.
In practice, there are very few HII region spectra with the quality that allow
this, so that most analyses depend on assumed ranges or relationships between
physical parameters, resulting in parametric solutions with underestimated
error bars. A representative result of our analysis yields Y_p = 0.249 \pm
0.009. However, given that most of the spectra analyzed to date do not
significantly constrain the primordial helium abundance, we argue in favor a
range of allowed values of 0.232 le Y_p le 0.258. [abstract abridged]

the estimation of radius of the star for an assumed mass of ~ 1.4 M_sun and to
see whether the point overlaps with the graphs for the neutron star equation of
state or whether it goes to the region of stars made of strange matter equation
of state. Using the well established formulae from general relativity for the
gravitational redshift and the `lensing effect' due to bending of photon
trajectories, we, in this letter, relate the parameters M and R with the
observable parameters, the redshift z and the radiation radius R_\infty, thus
constraining both M and R for specific ranges, without any other arbitrariness.
With the required inputs from observations, one ought to incorporate the
effects of self lensing of the compact stars which has been otherwise ignored

lensing makes a marked difference and constraints on the M-R relation.

  Although the observed strength of a C I line is constant from cool to hot RCB
stars, the strength is weaker than predicted by an amount equivalent to a
factor of four reduction of a line's gf-value. Asplund et al. dubbed this 'the
carbon problem' and discussed possible solutions.
  The [C I] 9850 A line seen clearly in R CrB and SU Tau confirms the magnitude
of the carbon problem revealed by the C I lines. The [C I] 8727 A line measured

the observed [C I] 8727 A line is a factor of 15 less than the well-determined

alleviated to some extent by a chromospheric-like temperature rise in these

equation of state derived from perturbative QCD up to second order in strong
coupling constant, and we compare it with that of a neutron star. After an
initial rapid cooling, a quark star may undergo the QCD phase transition to
become a neutron star. We propose several signatures for such a scenario: a
large amount of energy can be released due to latent heat, a long duration
$\gamma$-ray source, and a second neutrino burst after a supernova explosion.

shed light on the still uncertain radiation processes for the prompt GRB

a localized electron spin interacting with an environment of nuclear spins via
the Fermi contact hyperfine interaction. This work applies to an electron in
the s -type orbital ground state of a quantum dot or bound to a donor impurity,
and is valid for arbitrary polarization p of the nuclear spin system, and
arbitrary nuclear spin I in high magnetic fields. In the limit of p=1 and
I=1/2, the Born approximation of our perturbative theory recovers the exact
electron spin dynamics. We have found the form of the generalized master
equation (GME) for the longitudinal and transverse components of the electron
spin to all orders in the electron spin--nuclear spin flip-flop terms. Our
perturbative expansion is regular, unlike standard time-dependent perturbation
theory, and can be carried-out to higher orders. We show this explicitly with a
fourth-order calculation of the longitudinal spin dynamics. In zero magnetic
field, the fraction of the electron spin that decays is bounded by the
smallness parameter \delta=1/p^{2}N, where N is the number of nuclear spins
within the extent of the electron wave function. However, the form of the decay
can only be determined in a high magnetic field, much larger than the maximum
Overhauser field. In general the electron spin shows rich dynamics, described
by a sum of contributions with non-exponential decay, exponential decay, and
undamped oscillations. There is an abrupt crossover in the electron spin
asymptotics at a critical dimensionality and shape of the electron envelope
wave function. We propose a scheme that could be used to measure the
non-Markovian dynamics using a standard spin-echo technique, even when the
fraction that undergoes non-Markovian dynamics is small.

the smaller Eu$^{3+}$ causes chemical pressure and leads to a drastic increase
of the spin gap from about 190 K in LaCoO$_3$ to about 2000 K in EuCoO$_3$, so
that the spin-state transition is shifted to much higher temperatures. A
combined analysis of thermal expansion and susceptibility gives evidence that
the spin-state transition has to be attributed to a population of an
intermediate-spin state with orbital order for $x<0.5$ and without orbital
order for larger $x$. In contrast to the spin-state transition, the

by using Metropolis algorithm. We aimed to observe the deconfinement phase
transitions by using geometric methods. In order to do so we have proposed two
different methods which can be applied to $3-$dimensional effective spin model
consisting of Polyakov loop variables. The first method is based on studies of
cluster structures of each configuration. For each temperature, configurations
are obtained from a set of bond probability ($P$) values. At a certain
probability, percolating clusters start to emerge. Unless the probability value
coincides with the Coniglio-Klein probability value, the fluctuations are less
than the actual fluctuations at the critical point. In this method the task is
to identify the probability value which yields the highest peak in the
diverging quantities on finite lattices. The second method uses the scaling
function based on the surface renormalization which is of geometric origin.
Since this function is a scaling function, the measurements done on
different-size lattices yield the same value at the critical point, apart from
the correction to scaling terms. The linearization of the scaling function
around the critical point yields the critical point and the critical exponents.

information can be mitigated by oversampling the source. This is equivalent to
expanding the source using overcomplete systems of vectors (frames), as opposed
to the traditional basis expansions. Dependencies among the coefficients in
frame expansions often allow for better performance comparing to bases under
random losses of coefficients. We show that for any n-dimensional frame, any
source can be linearly reconstructed from only (n log n) randomly chosen frame
coefficients, with a small error and with high probability. Thus every frame
expansion withstands random losses better (for worst case sources) than the
orthogonal basis expansion, for which the (n log n) bound is attained. The
proof reduces to M.Rudelson's selection theorem on random vectors in the
isotropic position, which is based on the non-commutative Khinchine's
inequality.

fundamental particles) are inherently random. If the state of the system
depends on unknown parameters, then the distribution of the outcome depends on
these parameters too, and statistical inference problems result. Often one has
a choice of what measurement to take, corresponding to different experimental
set-ups or settings of measurement apparatus. This leads to a design
problem--which measurement is best for a given statistical problem. This paper
gives an introduction to this field in the most simple of settings, that of
estimating the state of a spin-half particle given n independent copies of the
particle. We show how in some cases asymptotically optimal measurements can be
constructed. Other cases present interesting open problems, connected to the
fact that for some models, quantum Fisher information is in some sense
non-additive. In physical terms, we have non-locality without entanglement.

chains. One has been described earlier by Han et al.: the chains are delayed at
the entrance of the constriction and escape with a rate that increases with
chain length. The other, actually dominating mechanism is here reported for the
first time: Some chains diffuse out of their main path into the corners of the

extended (by biologically unprecedented small changes) from its current maximal
