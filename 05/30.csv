universe. We have performed a series of ray-tracing experiments, and selected a
subsample of cases of strong lensing (multiple images, arcs, and Einstein
rings). For each case, we identify a massive galaxy that is primarily
responsible for lensing, and studied how the various density inhomogeneities
along the line of sight (other galaxies, background matter) affect the
properties of the image. The matter located near the lensing galaxy, and
physically associated with it, has a small effect. The background matter
increases the magnification by a few percents at most, while nearby galaxies
can increase it by up to about 10 percent. The effect on the image separation
is even smaller. The only significant effect results from the random alignment
of physically unassociated galaxies, which can increase the magnification by
factors of several, create additional images, and turn arcs into rings. We
conclude that the effect of environment on strong lensing in negligible in
general, and might be important only in rare cases. We show that our conclusion
does not depend on the radial density profile of the galaxies responsible for
lensing.

discovery of AGN whose optical emission is extinguished by dust. In this paper,
we use the Spitzer Space Telescope First Look Survey (FLS) to assess what
fraction of AGN with mid-infrared luminosities comparable to quasars are missed
in optical quasar surveys due to dust obscuration. We begin by using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg^2
extragalactic FLS. These quasars occupy a distinct region in mid-infrared color
space by virtue of their strong, red, continua. This has allowed us to define a
mid-infrared color criterion for selecting AGN candidates. About 2000 FLS
objects have colors consistent with them being AGN, but most are much fainter
in the mid-infrared than the SDSS quasars, which typically have 8 micron flux
densities, S(8.0), ~1 mJy. We have investigated the properties of the 43
objects with S(8.0) >= 1 mJy satisfying our AGN color selection. This sample
should contain both unobscured quasars, and AGN which are absent from the SDSS
survey due to extinction in the optical. After removing 16 known quasars, three
probable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from the
initial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects which are likely to be
obscured quasars or luminous Seyfert-2 galaxies. This suggests the numbers of
obscured and unobscured AGN are similar in samples selected in the mid-infrared
at S(8.0)~1 mJy.

there is an apparent lack of the extremely red objects found among the Centaurs

  The Uranian irregulars can be divided into three possible dynamical families,
but the colors collected show that two of these dynamical families, the Caliban
and Sycorax-clusters, have heterogeneous colors. Of the third possible family,
the 168-degree cluster containing two objects with similar average inclinations
but quite different average semi-major axis, only one object (U XXI Trinculo)
was observed. The heterogeneous colors and the large dispersion of the average
orbital elements leads us to doubt that they are collisional families. We favor
single captures as a more likely scenario. The two neptunians observed (N II
Nereid and S/2002 N1) both have very similar neutral, sun-like colors. Together
with the high collisional probability between these two objects over the age of
the solar system (Nesvorny et al. 2003, Holman et al. 2004), this suggests that
S/2002 N1 be a fragment of Nereid, broken loose during a collision or cratering
event with an undetermined impactor.

robustness of constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties in
both environments - the high density cluster and the low density field. This
paper is theoretically motivated, therefore, we work exclusively with simulated
data (nevertheless defined to match observations) to study the accuracy with
which input parameters for mass distributions for galaxies can be extracted. We
model galaxies in the cluster and the field using a wide range of mass
profiles: the truncated pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution, the
Navarro, Frenk and White profile, and a Power Law model with a core radius. We
find that independent of the choice of profile the mean mass of galaxies (of
the order of 10^{12}Mo) can be estimated to within 15% from ground-based data
and with an error of less than 10% with space observations. Additionally robust
constraints can be obtained on the mean slope of the mass profile. The two
standard parameters that characterise galaxy halo models, the central velocity
dispersion and the truncation radius can also be retrieved reliably from the
maximum-likelihood analysis. Furthermore, going beyond the usual formulation,
we propose a re-parameterisation of the mass models that allows us to put yet
stronger constraints on the aperture mass of a galaxy halo (with less than 10%
error). The gain in signal to noise using space observations, expected for
instance with the proposed SNAP satellite compared to ground based data in
terms of accuracy of retrieving input parameters is highly significant.

a specific combination that has zero-response to the gravitational wave signal,
and called it the {\it Zero-Signal Solution} (ZSS). This is a two-parameter
family of linear combinations of the generators of the TDI space, and its
response to a gravitational wave becomes null when these two parameters
coincide with the values of the angles of the source location in the sky.
Remarkably, the ZSS does not rely on any assumptions about the gravitational
waveform, and in fact it works for waveforms of any kind. Our approach is
analogous to the data analysis method introduced by G\""ursel & Tinto in the

wave detectors observing in coincidence a gravitational wave burst. The ZSS

function $F$ of $S_G$ as the multiplicities of its divisor components in
$\hat{S}_G$, a version parallel to the elliptic fibration near certain types of
simple singular fibers in Kodaira's elliptic surface theory. We further obtain
the uniqueness property of the function $F$ (modular local units) among all
local functions in $S_G$ near the singular point whose divisors in $\hat{S}_G $
display the affine $A$-$D$-$E$ diagram configuration.

  French abstract added, and several minor amendments made",,,,"math.NT math.CA",,"  The Selberg sieve provides majorants for certain arithmetic sequences, such
as the primes and the twin primes. We prove an L^2-L^p restriction theorem for
majorants of this type.
  An immediate application is to the estimation of exponential sums over prime
k-tuples. Let a_1,...,a_k and b_1,...,b_k be positive integers. For t on the
unit circle write h(t) := \sum_{n \in X} e(nt)$, where X is the set of all n <=
N such that the numbers a_1n + b_1,..., a_kn + b_k are all prime. We obtain
upper bounds for the L^p norm of h, p > 2, which are (conditionally on the
prime tuple conjecture) of the correct order of magnitude.
  As a second application we deduce from Chen's theorem, Roth's theorem, and a
transference principle that there are infinitely many arithmetic progressions
p_1 < p_2 < p_3 of primes, such that p_i + 2 is either a prime or a product of
two primes for each i=1,2,3.

about closed ovalless real surfaces. The conjecture then results from a
combination of two ingredients. On the one hand, we exploit integral geometric
comparison with orbifold metrics of constant positive curvature on real
surfaces of even positive genus. Here the singular points are Weierstrass
points. On the other hand, we exploit an analysis of the combinatorics on
unions of closed curves, arising as geodesics of such orbifold metrics.

including a proof of equivalence between the new representation and the
traditional Game Theory, and a proof of Classical Nash Theorem in the new
representation. And it also gives manipulation definition of quantum game and a
proof of the equivalence between this definition and the general abstract
representation. A Quantum Nash Proposition is proposed but without a general
proof. Then, some comparison between Nash Equilibrium (NE) and the
pseudo-dynamical equilibrium (PDE) is discussed. At last, we investigate the
possibility that whether such representation leads to truly Quantum Game, and
whether such a new representation is helpful to Classical Game, as an answer to
the questions in \cite{enk}. Some discussion on continuous-strategy games are
also included.
