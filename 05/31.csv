heat of a phase transition occurring in a hidden sector governed by the seesaw
mass scale v^2/M_Pl, where v is the electroweak scale and M_Pl the
gravitational mass scale. In our models, the seesaw scale is stabilized by
supersymmetry, implying that the LHC must discover superpartners with a
spectrum that reflects a low scale of fundamental supersymmetry breaking.
Newtonian gravity may be modified by effects arising from the exchange of
fields in the acceleressence sector whose Compton wavelengths are typically of
order the millimeter scale. There are two classes of models. In the first class
the universe is presently in a metastable vacuum and will continue to inflate
until tunneling processes eventually induce a first order transition. In the
simplest such model, the range of the new force is bounded to be larger than 25
microns in the absence of fine-tuning of parameters, and for couplings of order
unity it is expected to be \approx 100 microns. In the second class of models
thermal effects maintain the present vacuum energy of the universe, but on
further cooling, the universe will ""soon"" smoothly relax to a matter dominated
era. In this case, the range of the new force is also expected to be of order
the millimeter scale or larger, although its strength is uncertain. A firm
prediction of this class of models is the existence of additional energy
density in radiation at the eV era, which can potentially be probed in
precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background. An interesting
possibility is that the transition towards a matter dominated era has occurred
in the very recent past, with the consequence that the universe is currently
decelerating.

of the pair of extremely metal-deficient gas-rich dwarf galaxies SBS 0335-052 E
and W. The total magnitudes in U,B,V,R,I bands and the integrated fluxes of
H-alpha emission are measured for both galaxies, and their integrated colours
are derived. The analysis of their surface brightness (SB) distributions is
performed with the use of the azimuthally-averaged SB profiles. The latter were
modeled by the central Gaussian component and the underlying exponential
`disk', mainly contributing in the outermost, very low SB regions. The colours
of these LSB components are used to estimate the age of the oldest visible
stellar population. For the interpretation of the observed LSB colours their
contamination by the nebular emission of ionized gas is accounted for by the
use of the distribution of H-alpha flux. We compare the derived `gas-free'
colours with the colours predicted by the evolution synthesis models from the
PEGASE.2 package, considering three SF histories: a) instantaneous starburst,
b) continuous star formation with constant SFR, c) continuous exponentially
fading SF (e-fold time of 3 Gyr). We conclude that the `gas-free' colours of
the LSB component of the E galaxy can be best consistent with the instantaneous
starburst population (ages of less than ~100 Myr). Models with continuous SF
give less consistent results, but can be considered as acceptable. For such
scenarios, the `gas-free' colours require ages of less than ~400 Myr. For the W
galaxy, the situation is in general similar. But the colour (V-R) appears to be
quite red and implies a significantly older component. We briefly discuss the
possible evolution sequence between SBS 0335-052, HI 1225+01 and other
extremely metal-deficient galaxies based on the merger scenario.

starburst bubbles quickly blow out of small, high-redshift, galactic disks, but
must compete with the ram pressure of the infalling gas to escape into
intergalactic space. We show that the assumed efficiency of the star formation
rate dominates the bubble evolution and the metal, mass, and energy feedback
efficiencies. With star formation efficiency f*=0.01, the ram pressure of
infall can confine the bubbles around high-redshift dwarf galaxies with
circular velocities v_c>52 km/s. We can expect high metal and mass ejection
efficiencies, and moderate energy transport efficiencies in halos with
v_c~30-50 km/s and f*~0.01 as well as in halos with v_c~100 km/s and f*>>0.01.
Such haloes collapse successively from 1-2 sigma peaks in LambdaCDM Gaussian
density perturbations as time progresses. These dwarf galaxies can probably
enrich low and high-density regions of intergalactic space with metals to
10^-3-10^-2 Zsun as they collapse at z~8 and z<5 respectively. They also may be
able to provide adequate turbulent energy to prevent the collapse of other
nearby halos, as well as to significantly broaden Lyman-alpha absorption lines
to v_rms~20-40 km/s. We compute the timescales for the next starbursts if gas
freely falls back after a starburst, and find that, for star formation
efficiencies as low as f*<0.01, the next starburst should occur in less than
half the Hubble time at the collapse redshift. This suggests that episodic star
formation may be ubiquitous in dwarf galaxies.

contributions from two strong molecular hydrogen lines and an [Ar III] line in
that bandpass. IRAC is sensitive to the emission in the halos as well as in the
ionized regions that are optically bright. In NGC 246, we have observed an
unexpected ring of emission in the 5.8 and 8.0 micron IRAC bands not seen
previously at other wavelengths. In NGC 650 and NGC 3132, the 8.0 micron
emission is at larger distances from the central star compared to the optical

that band and the tendency for the molecular material to exist outside of the
ionized zones. In the flocculi of the outer halo of NGC 6543, however, this
trend is reversed, with the 8.0 micron emission bright on the inner edges of
the structures. This may be related to the emission mechanism, where the
molecular hydrogen is possibly excited in shocks in the NGC 6543 halo, whereas
the emission is likely fluorescently excited in the UV fields near the central

subcritical, supersonic turbulence can speed up star formation, through
enhanced ambipolar diffusion in shocks. The speedup overcomes a major objection
to the standard scenario of low-mass star formation involving ambipolar
diffusion, since the diffusion time scale at the average density of a molecular
cloud is typically longer than the cloud life time. At the same time, the
strong magnetic field can prevent the large-scale supersonic turbulence from
converting most of the cloud mass into stars in one (short) turbulence crossing
time, and thus alleviate the high efficiency problem associated with the
turbulence-controlled picture for low-mass star formation. We propose that
relatively rapid but inefficient star formation results from supersonic
collisions of somewhat subcritical gas in strongly magnetized, turbulent
clouds. The salient features of this shock-accelerated, ambipolar
diffusion-regulated scenario are demonstrated with numerical experiments.

typical of poor clusters or groups, rather than the more typical, massive

groups, display a colour-magnitude relation consistent with a passively
evolving stellar population formed at a redshift z_f>~2, in accordance with
observed galaxy populations in more massive clusters studied at comparable

systems formed at high redshift that have evolved passively from that epoch,
together with a galaxy population displaying more recent star formation. The
former population forms at ~2< z_f <~5, the latter at redshifts z<1. A model in
which stars do not evolve is clearly rejected by both by the colour of reddest

been accreting to the Galactic disc during the whole of its lifetime, and is
accreting today at a measurable rate, ~2 Msun per year across the full disc.
Estimates of the local star formation rate (SFR) using methods based on stellar
activity, support this picture. The best fits to all these data are for models
where the accretion rate is constant, or slowly rising with epoch. We explain
here how this conclusion, for a galaxy in a small bound group, is not in
conflict with graphs such as the Madau plot, which show that the universal SFR
has declined steadily from z=1 to the present day. We also show that a model in
which disc galaxies in general evolve by accreting major clouds of low
metallicity gas from their surroundings can explain many observations, notably
that the SFR for whole galaxies tends to show obvious variability, and
fractionally more for early than for late types, and yields lower dark to
baryonic matter ratios for large disc galaxies than for dwarfs. In the second

occupy the same quantum state). We also demonstrate that in this range the
stable equilibrium state corresponds to the fractal distribution of baryons and
due to the presence of fictitious particles predicted by MOFT this distribution

external field $H$, and a few of their modifications. The generalization to

$J_\perp$ region, degenerate perturbation theory applied to spin-$S$ ladders
predicts $2S$ critical curves in the parameter space $(J_\perp, H)$ for the
staggered field case, in contrast to $2S$ finite critical regions for the
uniform field case. All critical areas belong to a universality with central
charge $c=1$. On the other hand, we employ Abelian and non-Abelian bosonization
techniques in the weak rung-coupling region. They show that in the spin-1
ladder, a sufficiently strong uniform field engenders a $c=1$ critical state
regardless of the sign of $J_\perp$. Whereas, the staggered field is expected
not to yield any singular phenomena. From the bosonization techniques, new
field-theoretical expressions of string order parameters in the spin-1 systems

describe the transport properties of the cuprate superconductors in the

in-plane resistivity, is generalized to the ``strange metal'' phase at higher
temperature/doping. The short-range antiferromagnetic order and the gauge field
fluctuations, which were the key ingredients in the theory for the pseudogap
phase, also play an important role in the present case. The main difference
between these two phases is caused by the existence of an underlying
statistical $\pi$-flux lattice for charge carriers in the former case, whereas
the background flux is absent in the latter case. The Fermi surface then
changes from small ``arcs'' in the pseudogap to a rather large closed line in
the strange metal phase. As a consequence the celebrated linear in T dependence
of the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is shown explicitly to recover.
The doping concentration and temperature dependence of theoretically calculated
in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity, spin-relaxation rate and AC conductivity
are compared with experimental data, showing good agreement.

systems, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. We investigate work
fluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of equilibrium
under the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the probability
density P(W) that a work equal to W is exerted upon the system along a given
non-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory thermodynamics formalism
to quantify work fluctuations in the large-size limit. We then define a
trajectory entropy S(W) that counts the number of non-equilibrium trajectories
P(W)=exp(S(W)/kT) with work equal to W. A trajectory free-energy F(W) can also
be defined, which has a minimum at a value of the work that has to be
efficiently sampled to quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this
formalism a Lagrange multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays
the role of a trajectory temperature. Our solution for P(W) exactly satisfies
the fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate
heat-fluctuations for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The
heat distribution is then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing
small and frequent heat exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the
statistics of large deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of
the exponential tails is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature.
Finite-size effects to the large-N theory and the recovery of work
distributions for finite N are also discussed. Finally, we pay particular
attention to the case of magnetic nanoparticle systems under the action of a
magnetic field H where work and heat fluctuations are predicted to be
observable in ramping experiments in micro-SQUIDs.

which possesses strong collective flow components. Here, we demonstrate that
the resulting medium-induced gluon radiation does not depend solely on the
energy density of the medium, but also on the collective flow. Both components
cannot be disentangled on the basis of leading hadron spectra, but the
measurement of particle production associated to high-pT trigger particles,
jet-like correlations and jets, allows for their independent characterization.
In particular, we show that flow effects lead to a characteristic breaking of
the rotational symmetry of the average jet energy and jet multiplicity
distribution in the $\eta \times \phi$-plane. We argue that data on the
medium-induced broadening of jet-like particle correlations in Au+Au collisions
at RHIC provide a first evidence for a significant distortion of parton
fragmentation due to the longitudinal collective flow.

S^2, which is also a classical solution of the same model, has actually smaller
free energy than the fuzzy CP^2, Monte Carlo simulation shows that the fuzzy
CP^2 is stable even nonperturbatively due to the suppression of tunneling
effects at large N as far as the coefficient of the cubic term ($\alpha$) is
sufficiently large. As \alpha is decreased, both the fuzzy CP$^2$ and the fuzzy
S^2 collapse to a solid ball and the system is essentially described by the
pure Yang-Mills model (\alpha = 0). The corresponding transitions are of first
order and the critical points can be understood analytically. The gauge group
generated dynamically above the critical point turns out to be of rank one for
both CP^2 and S^2 cases. Above the critical point, we also perform perturbative
calculations for various quantities to all orders, taking advantage of the
one-loop saturation of the effective action in the large-N limit. By
extrapolating our Monte Carlo results to N=\infty, we find excellent agreement
with the all order results.

attempted in this work both theoretically and experimentally based on dilute
water dispersions of two different homogenous spherical particles, polystyrene
latexes and poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) microgels. When Rayleigh-Gans-Debye
approximation is valid, a new radius $R_{s}$, referred to as a static radius,
can be obtained from the static light scattering $(SLS) $. If the absolute
magnitude of the scattered intensity and some constants that are related to the
instrument and samples are known, the average molar mass for large particles
can be measured. The size information obtained from SLS is purely related to
the optical properties of particles, i.e., to $R_{s}$ and its distribution
$G(R_{s}) $. The size information obtained from dynamic light scattering $(DLS)
$ is more complicated, the size distribution of which is a composite
distribution that is not only related to the optical properties of particles,
but also related to the hydrodynamic properties and the scattering vector.
Strictly speaking, an apparent hydrodynamic radius $R_{h,app}$ is a composite
size obtained from averaging the term $\exp (-q^{2}D\tau) $ in the static size
distribution $G(R_{s}) $, with the weight $R_{s}^{6}P(q,R_{s}) $ that is also a
function of both $R_{s}$ and the scattering vector $q$.

reliable classification of the level structure is to be obtained for open-shell

traditionally carried out in jj-coupling, a LSJ coupling notation often occurs
much more appropriate for classifying the valence-shell structure of atoms.
Apart from the (known) transformation of single open shells, however, further
demand on proper transformation coefficients has recently arose from the study
of open d- and f-shell elements, the analysis of multiple--excited levels, or
the investigation on inner-shell phenomena. Therefore, in order to facilitate a
simple access to LS <-> jj transformation matrices, here we present an
extension to the Racah program for the set-up and the transformation of
symmetry-adapted functions. A flexible notation is introduced for defining and
for manipulating open-shell configurations at different level of complexity
which can be extended also to other coupling schemes and, hence, may help
determine an optimum classification of atomic levels and processes in the
future.

the scheme is comparable with other quantum computing proposals.

there are unitary errors in the quantum gates implementing the quantum
algorithm. While the first kind of errors has a classical limit, the second one
has no classical analogue. It is shown that, whereas in the first case
(``classical errors'') the decay of fidelity is very sensitive to the dynamical
regime, in the second case (``quantum errors'') it is almost independent of the
dynamical behavior of the simulated system. Therefore, the rich variety of
behaviors found in the study of the stability of quantum motion under
``classical'' perturbations has no correspondence in the fidelity of quantum
computation under its natural perturbations. In particular, in this latter case
it is not possible to recover the semiclassical regime in which the fidelity
decays with a rate given by the classical Lyapunov exponent.
