low-mass X-ray binary MS1603.6+2600 (UW CrB). The events last for a few tens of
seconds, exhibit a very fast rise and slow decay, and involve optical
brightening of a factor of 2-3. The flares appear distinct from the lower level
flickering and instead strongly resemble reprocessed type-I X-ray bursts as
seen in a number of other neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. In conjunction
with the previously reported candidate X-ray burst, these confirm that the
compact object in UW CrB is a neutron star. We examine the optical burst
brightness and recurrence times and discuss how the nature of the system can be
constrained. We conclude that the source is most likely an accretion disk
corona source at an intermediate distance, rather than a nearby quiescent
system or very distant dipper.

  (Springer-Verlag)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Type Ia supernovae have recently received considerable attention because it
appears that they can be used as ""standard candles"" to measure cosmic distances
out to billions of light years away from us. Observations of type Ia supernovae
seem to indicate that we are living in a universe that started to accelerate
its expansion when it was about half its present age. These conclusions rest
primarily on phenomenological models which, however, lack proper theoretical
understanding, mainly because the explosion process, initiated by thermonuclear
fusion of carbon and oxygen into heavier elements, is difficult to simulate
even on supercomputers. Here, we investigate a new way of modeling turbulent
thermonuclear deflagration fronts in white dwarfs undergoing a type Ia
supernova explosion. Our approach is based on a level set method which treats
the front as a mathematical discontinuity and allows for full coupling between
the front geometry and the flow field. New results of the method applied to the
problem of type Ia supernovae are obtained. It is shown that in 2-D with high
spatial resolution and a physically motivated subgrid scale model for the
nuclear flames numerically ""converged"" results can be obtained, but for most
initial conditions the stars do not explode. In contrast, simulations in 3-D,
do give the desired explosions and many of their properties, such as the
explosion energies, lightcurves and nucleosynthesis products, are in very good
agreement with observed type Ia supernovae.

of the X-ray flux of the pulsar at its radio period. The pulse shape and pulsed
fraction are apparently different at lower and higher energies of the observed
0.2-10 keV energy range, which suggests that the radiation cannot be explained
by a single emission mechanism. The X-ray spectrum of the pulsar can be fitted
with a power-law model with a photon index about 1.75 and an (isotropic)
luminosity about 9.8e29 erg/s in the 0.2-10 keV. Better fits are obtained with
two-component, power-law plus thermal, models with index of 1.30 and 9.7e29
erg/s for the power-law component that presumably originates from the pulsar's
magnetosphere. The thermal component, dominating at E>0.7 keV, can be
interpreted as radiation from heated polar caps on the neutron star surface
covered with a hydrogen atmosphere. The inferred effective temperature, radius,
and bolometric luminosity of the polar caps are about 1 MK, 250 m, and 3e29
erg/s. Optical through X-ray nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar can be described
as a single power-law with index 1.3-1.4 for the two-component X-ray fit. The
ratio of the nonthermal X-ray (1-10 keV) luminosity to the nonthermal optical
(4000-9000 \AA) luminosity is within the range of 1e2-1e3 observed for younger
pulsars, which suggests that the magnetospheric X-ray and optical emissions are
powered by the same mechanism in all pulsars. An upper limit on the temperature
of the bulk of the neutron star surface, inferred from the optical and X-ray
data, is about 0.15 MK. We also analyze X-ray observations of several other old

radio galaxies at low redshift, the environments provide sufficient pressure to
confine the radio lobes. The weak gas emission is particularly interesting for
3C 184, where a gravitational arc is seen, suggesting the presence of a massive
cluster. Here Chandra data complement the XMM-Newton measurements by spatially
separating X-rays from the extended atmosphere, the nucleus and the small-scale
radio source. For 3C 292 the X-ray-emitting gas has a temperature of ~2 keV and
luminosity of 6.5E43 erg/s, characteristic of a poor cluster. In all three

refute a popular misconception by showing that the outer planets formed quickly

formation. Oligarchy ends when the surface density of the oligarchs becomes
comparable to that of the small bodies. Dynamical friction is no longer able to
balance viscous stirring and the oligarchs' random velocities increase. In the
inner-planet system, oligarchs collide and coalesce. In the outer-planet
system, some of the oligarchs are ejected. In both the inner- and outer-planet
systems, this stage ends once the number of big bodies has been reduced to the
point that their mutual interactions no longer produce large-scale chaos.
Subsequently, dynamical friction by the residual small bodies circularizes and
flattens their orbits. The final stage of planet formation involves the clean
up of the residual small bodies. Clean up has been poorly explored.

planets around main-sequence stars using radial velocities, transits,
astrometry, and microlensing. For conventionally-discussed signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) thresholds, S/N ~ 8, the last three methods are roughly comparable
in terms of both the total number of planets detected and the mass distribution
of their host stars. However we argue that S/N ~ 25 is a more conservative and
realistic S/N threshold. We show analytically and numerically that the decline
in the number of detections as a function of S/N is very steep for radial
velocities, transits, and astrometry, such that the number of expected
detections at S/N ~ 25 is more than an order-of-magnitude smaller than at
conventional S/N thresholds. Indeed, unless Earth-mass planets are very common
or are packed much closer to their parent stars than in the solar system,
future searches using these methods (as they are currently planned) may not
yield any reliable Earth-mass planet detections. On the other hand,
microlensing has a much shallower S/N slope than the other techniques and so
has much greater sensitivity at realistic S/N thresholds. We show that even if
all stars have Earth-mass planets at periods of one year (and adopting other
optimistic assumptions as well), the combined yield of all four techniques
would be the detection of only about five such planets at S/N ~ 25.

quasars, finding 103 unique matches from which we determine a matching radius
of 3.8 arcseconds. Using this we make immediate identifications of roughly half
of all XMM point sources as quasars (159) or stars (55). We have estimated the
typical error on SDSS-determined photometric cluster redshifts to be 5% for
relaxed systems, and 11% for disturbed systems, by comparing them to
spectroscopic redshifts for eight previously-known clusters. The error for
disturbed systems may be problematic for cluster surveys relying on photometric
redshifts alone. We use the False Discovery Rate to select 41 XMM sources (25
point-like, 16 extended) statistically associated with SDSS galaxy

distribution and optical appearance of protoplanetary disks. Using simple
analytic estimates on the one hand, and detailed 1+1-D models on the other
hand, we show that, while the time scale for settling down to the equator may
exceed the life time of the disk, it takes much less time for even small grains
of 0.1 micron to settle down to a few pressure scale heights. This is often
well below the original location of the disk's photosphere, and the disk
therefore becomes effectively 'flatter'. If turbulent stirring is included, a
steady state solution can be found, which is typically reached after a few
times 1E5 years. Dependent on the strength of the turbulence, the shape of the
disk in such a steady state can be either fully flaring, or flaring only up to
a certain radius and self-shadowed beyond that radius. We show that these
partly self-shadowed disks have a much weaker mid- to far-infrared flux than
the fully flaring ones. We also show that these self-shadowed regions of the
disk are very weak in resolved images of scattered light, in contrast to the
fully flaring disks. From the calculations with compact grains it follows that,
after about 1E6 years, most disks should be self-shadowed. The fact that some
older disks are still observed with the characteristics of flaring disks
therefore seems somewhat inconsistent with the time scales predicted by the
settling model based on compact grains. This suggests that perhaps even the
small grains (lesssim 0.1 micron) have a porous or fractal structure, or that
the different geometries of observed disks is merely a reflection of the
turbulent state of these disks.

converted into gravitational potentials, and the maximum relative gravitational
torques due to the bars and the spirals are estimated. We find that spiral
strength, Q_s, and bar strength, Q_b, correlate well with other measures of
spiral arm and bar amplitudes, and that spiral and bar strengths also correlate
well with each other. We also find a correlation between the position angle of
the end of the bar and the position angle of the inner spiral. These
correlations suggest that the bars and spirals grow together with the same
rates and pattern speeds. We also show that the strongest bars tend to have the
most open spiral patterns. Because open spirals imply high disk-to-halo mass
ratios, bars and spirals most likely grow together as a combined disk
instability. They stop growing for different reasons, however, giving the
observed variation in bar-spiral morphologies. Bar growth stops because of
saturation when most of the inner disk is in the bar, and spiral growth stops
because of increased stability as the gas leaves and the outer disk heats up.

flares in blazar jets, involve collisions between local overdensities of matter
being ejected by a central engine and moving along the jet with different
velocities. Prior to such collisions, the matter is relatively cold and
therefore does not produce intrinsic non-thermal radiation. However, due to
Comptonization of external radiation by cold electrons, the presence of such
matter should be apparent by prominent precursor soft X-ray flares, visible
prior to non-thermal $\gamma$-ray flares. In this paper we discuss the
predicted properties of such precursors and study the dependence of their
properties (luminosities and light curves) on kinematic parameters of
relativistic ejecta and on an angle of view. We demonstrate that the lack of
evidence for luminous soft X-ray precursors can be reconciled with our
predictions for their properties if acceleration and collimation of a jet takes
about three distance decades. We briefly discuss the severe constraints on the

percentage of resources of node $i$ which is offered to node $j$. Initially
then, the graph is fully connected, i.e. all non-diagonal matrix elements
$r(i,j)$ are different from zero. During the simulation, the amounts of
resources $p(i)$ change according to the balance equation. Also, nodes
reorganise their activity with time, going to give more resources to those
which give them more. This is the rule of varying the coefficients $r(i,j)$.
The result is that after some transient time, only some pairs $(m,n)$ of nodes
survive with non-zero $p(m)$ and $p(n)$, each pair with symmetric and positive
$r(m,n)=r(n,m)$. Other coefficients $r(m,i\ne n)$ vanish. Unpaired nodes remain
with no resources, i.e. their $p(i)=0$, and they cease to be active, as they
have nothing to offer. The percentage of survivors (i.e. those with with $p(i)$
positive) increases with the velocity of varying the numbers $r(i,j)$, and it
slightly decreases with the size of the group. The picture and the results can
be interpreted as a description of a social algorithm leading to marriages.

other substitutions such as AB2 (A=Be, Zr, Nb and Ta). The sigma-bands (boron

In (Mg1-xAlxB2) Tc diminishes with Al content, the other compounds are not

relevant transport properties of the underlying IHS gas. First, the EHS gas is
assumed to be subject to the action of an effective drag force with a friction

evaluated in the local equilibrium approximation for simplicity. Second, the
collision rate of the EHS gas is reduced by a factor $(1+\alpha)/2$, relative

transport coefficients shows that the EHS model reproduces almost perfectly the
self-diffusion coefficient and reasonably well the two transport coefficients
defining the heat flux, the shear viscosity being reproduced within a deviation
less than 14% (for $\alpha\geq 0.5$). Moreover, the EHS model is seen to agree
with the fundamental collision integrals of inelastic mixtures and dense gases.

relations. Based on the three-chain approximation, explicit formulas are
developed for the strain energy of a chain modeled as a self-avoiding random

distribution function of end-to-end vectors, the strain energy density of a
network is described by the Ogden law with only two material constants. For the
des Cloizeaux distribution function, the constitutive equation involves three
adjustable parameters. The governing equations are verified by fitting
observations on uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression and biaxial tension of
elastomers. Good agreement is demonstrated between the experimental data and
the results of numerical analysis. An analytical formula is derived for the
ratio of the Young's modulus of a self-avoiding chain to that of a Gaussian

exceeds that in a Gaussian network by a factor of three, whereas the elastic
modulus of a chain with the generalized stretched exponential distribution
function equals about half of the modulus of a Gaussian chain.

`lower density' region, where the condensate is dominated by electronic

coherence. Increasing the density of excitations in the system, partially due
to the screening of Coulomb interaction, the excitations contributing to the
condensate become mainly photon-like and coherence is reestablished for any

diagram, the energy gap of the quasi-particle spectrum still closes when the
disorder strength is increased. Above mean-field, thermal, quantum and

concept is further generalized to a category of globally hyperbolic spectral

Then a local generally covariant quantum field theory is introduced as a
covariant functor between such a category of globally hyperbolic spectral
geometries and the category of involutive algebras (or *-algebras). Thus, a
local covariant quantum field theory over spectral geometries assigns quantum
fields not just to a single noncommutative geometry (or noncommutative
spacetime), but simultaneously to ``all'' spectral geometries, while respecting
the covariance principle demanding that quantum field theories over isomorphic

equations for the spin and energy of a relativistic body interacting with other
bodies in the post-Newtonian expansion scheme. The bodies can be arbitrarily
shaped and can be strongly self-gravitating. The effects of all mass and
current multipoles are taken into account. As part of the computation one of
the 2PN potentials parametrizing the metric is obtained. The formulae obtained
here for spin and energy evolution coincide with those obtained by Damour,
Soffel and Xu for the case of weakly self-gravitating bodies. By combining an
Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman-type surface integral approach with multipolar
expansions we extend the domain of validity of these evolution equations to a
wide class of strongly self-gravitating bodies. This paper completes in a
self-contained way a previous work by Racine and Flanagan on translational
equations of motion for compact objects.

dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Efficient calculations for dynamical
problems of LQG can therefore be performed only if one has sufficient control
over the volume spectrum. While closed formulas for the matrix elements are
currently available in the literature, these are complicated polynomials in 6j
symbols which in turn are given in terms of Racah's formula which is too
complicated in order to perform even numerical calculations for the
semiclassically important regime of large spins. Hence, so far not even
numerically the spectrum could be accessed. In this article we demonstrate that
by means of the Elliot -- Biedenharn identity one can get rid of all the 6j
symbols for any valence of the gauge invariant vertex, thus immensely reducing
the computational effort. We use the resulting compact formula to study
numerically the spectrum of the gauge invariant 4 -- vertex. The techniques
derived in this paper could be of use also for the analysis of spin -- spin
interaction Hamiltonians of many -- particle problems in atomic and nuclear
physics.

allows us to show that the acoustic line element can be conformally mapped to
the line element of a stationary torsion loop in non-Riemannian gravity. Two
examples of such sonic analogues are given. The first is when we choose the
static torsion loop in teleparallel gravity. In this case Cartan torsion vector
in the far from the vortex approximation is shown to be proportional to the
quantum vortex number of the superfluid. Also in this case the torsion vector
is shown to be proportional to the superfluid vorticity in the presence of
vortices. Torsion loops in RC spacetime does not favor the formation of
superfluid vortices. It is suggested that the teleparallel model may help to
find a model for superfluid neutron stars vortices based on non-Riemannian

thermal diffusion in the framework of general relativistic perturbation theory.
When a general equation of state depending on temperature is used, the
perturbations of the fluid result in heat flux which is coupled with the
spacetime geometry through the Einstein field equations. Our results show that
the frequency of the first pressure (p) and gravity (g) oscillation modes is
significantly affected by thermal diffusion, while that of the fundamental (f)
mode is basically unaltered due to the global nature of that oscillation. The
damping time of the oscillations is generally much smaller than in the
adiabatic case (more than two orders of magnitude for the p- and g-modes)
reflecting the effect of thermal dissipation. Both the isothermal and adiabatic
limits are recovered in our treatment and we study in more detail the
intermediate regime. Our formalism finds its natural astrophysical application
in the study of the oscillation properties of newly born neutron stars, neutron
stars with a deconfined quark core phase, or strange stars which are all
promising sources of gravitational waves with frequencies in the band of the
first generation and advanced ground-based interferometric detectors.

increases with the neutrino mass scale, in sharp contrast to the type I case

find a lower bound on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino,
significantly below the corresponding type I bound for partially degenerate

making leptogenesis more consistent with the gravitino constraints in

closed string can get `polarized', as the spinors acquire non-zero vevs in
directions correlating with the orientation of close-by D-branes. Reversing the
argument, this may allow for worldsheet configurations - with non-trivial
spinor structure - that source RR moments.

corresponding to the stable topological pseudoisotopy functor is true for the
fundamental groups of a large class of 3-manifolds. We also prove that if the
FIC is true for irreducible 3-manifold groups then it is true for all
3-manifold groups. In fact, this follows from a more general result we prove
here, namely we show that if the FIC is true for each vertex group of a graph
of groups with trivial edge groups then the FIC is true for the fundamental
group of the graph of groups. This result is part of a program to prove FIC for
the fundamental group of a graph of groups where all the vertex and edge groups
satisfy FIC. A consequence of the first result gives a partial solution to a
problem in the problem list of R. Kirby. We also deduce that the FIC is true
for a class of virtually PD_3-groups.
  Another main aspect of this article is to prove the FIC for all Haken
3-manifold groups assuming that the FIC is true for B-groups. By definition a
B-group contains a finite index subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group of
a compact irreducible 3-manifold with incompressible nonempty boundary so that
each boundary component is of genus \geq 2. We also prove the FIC for a large
class of B-groups and moreover, using a recent result of L.E. Jones we show
that the surjective part of the FIC is true for any B-group.

ideal I which is defined to be the intersection of all minimal reductions of I.
The first main result is a closed formula for the graded core(m) of the maximal
graded ideal m of an arbitrary standard graded algebra A over a field k. This
formula allows us to study basic properties of the graded core and to construct
counter-examples to some open questions on the core of ideals in a local ring.
For instance, we can show that in general, core(m \otimes E) \neq
core(m)\otimes E, where E is a field extension of k. From this it follows that
the equation core(I R') = core(I)R' does not hold for an arbitrary flat local
homomorphism R \to R' of Cohen-Macaulay local rings. The second main result
proves the formulae core(I)= (J^r:I^r)I = (J^r:I^r)J = J^{r+1}:I^r for any
equimultiple ideal I in a Cohen-Macaulay ring R with with characteristic zero
residue field, where J is a minimal reduction of I and r is its reduction
number. This result has been obtained independently by Polini-Ulrich and
Hyry-Smith in the one-dimensional case or when R is a Gorenstein ring.
Moreover, we can prove that core(I) = IK, where K is the conductor of R in the
blowing-up ring at I.

Macaulayfications of projective schemes. Let Y be the blow-up of a projective
scheme X = Proj R along the ideal sheaf of I \subset R. It is known that there
are embeddings Y \cong Proj k[(I^e)_c] for c \ge d(I)e + 1, where d(I) denotes
the maximal generating degree of I, and that there exists a Cohen-Macaulay ring
of the form k[(I^e)_c] if and only if H^0(Y,O_Y) = k, H^i(Y,O_Y) = 0 for i =
1,...,dim Y-1, Y is equidimensional and Cohen-Macaulay. Cutkosky and Herzog
asked when there is a linear bound on c and e ensuring that k[(I^e)_c] is a
Cohen-Macaulay ring. We obtain a surprising compelte answer to this question,
namely, that under the above conditions, there are well determined invariants a
and b such that k[(I^e)_c] is Cohen-Macaulay for all c > d(I)e + a and e > b.
Our approach is based on recent results on the asymptotic linearity of the
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of ideal powers. We also investigate the
existence of a Cohen-Macaulay Rees algebra of the form R[(I^e)_ct] (which
provides an arithmetic Macaulayfication for X). If R has negative a*-invariant,
we prove that such a Cohen-Macaulay Rees algebra exists if and only if f_*O_Y =
O_X, R^i f*O_Y = 0 for i > 0, Y is equidimensional and Cohen-Macaulay.
Especially, these conditions imply the Cohen-Macaulayness of R[(I^e)_ct] for
all c > d(I)e + a and e > b. The above results can be applied to obtain several
new classes of Cohen-Macaulay algebras.

approximately 0.7-0.8. After that, the flow undergoes a transition to a gas or
fluid composed of distinct vortices. Simultaneously, the magnitude of the decay
exponent crosses over to gamma approximately 0.4. An exact relation for the
total number of vortices, N(t), in terms of the mean circulation of an
individual vortex is derived. A theory predicting that N(t) is proportional to
t^{-xi} and the magnitudes of exponents gamma=2/5 and xi=4/5 is presented and
the possibility of an additional very late-time cross-over to gamma=1/3 and

research, focusing on the LBL Bevatron/Bevalac facility in the 1970's. An early
concept of high hadronic density fireball formation, and subsequent isentropic

of physics observables that could determine the nuclear matter equation of
state at several times nuclear ground state matter density. With the advent of
QCD the goal of locating, and characterizing the hadron-parton deconfinement
phase transformation suggested the need for higher $\sqrt{s}$, the research
thus moving to the BNL AGS and CERN SPS, finally to RHIC at BNL. A set of
physics observables is discussed where present data span the entire $\sqrt{s}$
domain, from Bevalac and SIS at GSI, to top RHIC energy. Referring,
selectively, to data concerning bulk hadron production, the overall $\sqrt{s}$
evolution of directed and radial flow observables, and of pion pair
Bose-Einstein correlation are discussed. The hadronization process is studied
in the grand canonical statistical model. The resulting hadronization points in
the plane T vs. $\mu_B$ converge onto the parton-hadron phase boundary
predicted by finite $\mu_B$ lattice QCD, from top SPS to RHIC energy. At lower
SPS and top AGS energy a steep strangeness maximum occurs at which the
Wroblewski parameter $\lambda_s \approx $ 0.6; a possible connection to the QCD
critical point is discussed. Finally the unique new RHIC physics is addressed:
high $p_T$ hadron suppression and jet ""tomography"".

argued that the derivatives at origin can be evaluated by Monte Carlo

the Maxwell equations are interpreted as the electromagnetic component of the

electrons and photons as real particles in three-dimensional space, following
guiding conditions derived from the particle-wave-functions to which they are
associated. The guiding condition for the electron is taken from Bohmian
mechanics, while the photon velocity is defined as the ratio between the
Poynting vector and the electromagnetic energy density. The case of many
particles is considered, taking into account their statistical properties. The
formalism is applied to a two level system, providing a satisfactory
description for spontaneous emission, Lamb shift, scattering, absorption,
dispersion, resonance fluorescence and vacuum fields. This model adequately
describes quantum jumps by the entanglement between the photon and the atomic
system and it will prove to be very useful in the simulation of quantum devices
for quantum computers and quantum information systems. A possible relativistic

qualitatively all the imaging properties of the entangled beams, even in ways
