density gradient system (based on DENMAX) to identify the structures, and then
apply an iterative approximate method to identify unbound particles, allowing
fast calculation of bound substructures. After producing a catalog of separate
energetically bound substructures we check to see which of these are
energetically bound to adjacent substructures. For such bound complex subhalos,
we combine components and check if additional free particles are also bound to
the union, repeating the process iteratively until no further changes are
found. Thus our subhalos can contain more than one density maximum, but the
scheme is stable: starting with a small smoothing length initially produces
small structures which must be combined later, and starting with a large
smoothing length produces large structures within which sub-substructure is
found. We apply this algorithm to three simulations. Two which are using the
TPM algorithm by Bode et al. (2000) and one on a simulated halo by Diemand
(2004). For all these halos we find about 5-8% of the mass in substructures.

supernova has become optically thin early on in the 1420 MHz and 610 MHz bands
while it has only recently entered the optically thin phase in the 325 MHz
band. The radio light curve in the 235 MHz band is more or less flat. This
indicates that the supernova is undergoing a transition from an optically thick
to optically thin limit in this frequency band. In addition, we analyze the SN
radio spectra at five epochs on day 3000, 3200, 3266, 3460 and 3730 since
explosion. Day 3200 spectrum shows a synchrotron cooling break. SN 1993J is the
only young supernova for which the magnetic field and the size of the radio
emitting region are determined through unrelated methods. Thus the mechanism
that controls the evolution of the radio spectra can be identified. We suggest
that at all epochs, the synchrotron self absorption mechanism is primarily
responsible for the turn-over in the spectra. Light curve models based on free
free absorption in homogeneous or inhomogeneous media at high frequencies
overpredict the flux densities at low frequencies. The discrepancy is
increasingly larger at lower and lower frequencies. We suggest that an extra
opacity, sensitively dependent on frequency, is likely to account for the
difference at lower frequencies. The evolution of the magnetic field
(determined from synchrotron self absorption turn-over) is roughly consistent
with $B \propto t^{-1}$. Radio spectral index in the optically thin part
evolves from $\alpha \sim 0.8-1.0$ at few tens of days to $\sim 0.6$ in about
10 years.

accurately modeled as a multi-temperature thermal plasma with cool (kT < 1 keV)
and hot (kT > 3 keV) components. The presence of a hot component is compelling
evidence that the X-rays originate in magnetically confined plasma, either in
the Herbig star itself or in the corona of an as yet unseen late-type
companion. The X-ray temperatures and luminosity (log Lx = 30.5 ergs/s) are
within the range expected for a T Tauri companion, but high resolution Chandra
and HST images constrain the separation of a putative companion to less than 1
arcsec. We place these new results into broader context by comparing the X-ray
and bolometric luminosities of a sample of nearby Herbig stars with those of T
Tauri stars and classical main-sequence Be stars. We also test the predictions
of a model that attributes the X-ray emission of Herbig stars to magnetic
activity that is sustained by a shear-powered dynamo.

excess, which can be well modelled by either one or two blackbody components,
in addition to the hard X-ray power-law. The temperatures of these blackbodies
(~100-500 eV) are too high to be direct thermal emission from the accretion
disc, so Comptonization is suggested. Two populations of Comptonizing
electrons, with different temperatures, are needed to model the broad-band
spectrum. The hotter of these produces what is seen as the hard X-ray

show prominent Wolf-Rayet type emission features, and prominent lines of HI and
HeI, indicative of a very young age (t ~ few x 10^6 yr). Their luminosities
make each of them at least as luminous as the massive young cluster R136 in 30
Doradus in the LMC, and their individual masses are estimated to be 1-7.5x10^5
M_sun. In addition, the projected separation of the cluster pair is 42 pc. The
measured velocity difference between the clusters is small, \Delta V=49+/-21
km/s, and within 2 sigma of the expected orbital velocity V_orb=5-12 km/s if
they are bound. Dynamical models predict that binary clusters with these
properties would merge in a short timescale of a few orbital periods
(P=20-50x10^6 yr). The discovery of this binary cluster suggests that mergers
of young massive clusters could lead to the formation of the most massive
globular clusters such as omega Cen in our Galaxy and G1 in M31. Alternatively,
if they are not gravitationally bound, these objects would individually evolve
into two normal globular clusters.

density profiles (DPs) for the total mass adopted from the DPs of haloes within
dissipationless LambdaCDM N-body simulations. Ellipticals turn out to be
inconsistent with cuspy low-concentration NFW models representing the total
mass, nor are they consistent with a steeper -1.5 inner slope, nor with the
shallower models proposed by Navarro et al. 04, nor with NFW models 10 times
more concentrated than predicted, as deduced from several X-ray observations:
the mass models, extrapolated inwards, lead to local mass-to-light ratios that
are smaller than the stellar value inside an effective radius (R_e), and to
central aperture velocity dispersions that are much smaller than observed. This
conclusion remains true as long as there is no sharp steepening (slope < -2) of
the dark matter (DM) DPs just inside 0.01 virial radii. The too low total mass
and velocity dispersion produced within R_e by an NFW-like total mass profile
suggests that the stellar component should dominate the DM one out to at least
R_e. It should then be difficult to kinematically constrain the inner slope of
the dark matter DP of ellipticals. The high concentration parameters deduced
from X-ray observations appear to be a consequence of fitting an NFW model to
the total mass DP made up of a stellar component that dominates inside and a DM
component that dominates outwards. An appendix gives the virial mass dependence
of the concentration parameter, central density, and total mass of the Navarro
et al. model. In a 2nd appendix are given single integral expressions for the
velocity dispersions averaged along the line-of-sight, in circular apertures
and in thin slits, for general luminosity density and mass distributions, with

First we show the existence of solutions for Lieb-Wu equations with an

the Bethe states. The results are consistent with Takahashi's string hypothesis
if the system has the so(4) symmetry. With the Aharonov-Bohm-type magnetic
flux, however, the number of Bethe states increases and the standard string
hypothesis does not hold. In fact, the so(4) symmetry reduces to the direct sum
of charge-u(1) and spin-sl(2) symmetry through the change of AB-flux strength.
Next, extending Kirillov's approach, we derive two combinatorial formulas from
the relation among the characters of so(4)- or (u(1)\oplus sl(2))-modules. One
formula reproduces Essler-Korepin-Schoutens' combinatorial formula for counting
the number of Bethe states in the so(4)-case. From the exact analysis of the

resistive. From a large number of current-voltage curves measured at several
distance along the DNA, we estimate a conductivity of about 10-6-10-5 S.cm-1

correlated with its flattened conformation on the surface (reduced thickness,

intercalating an organic semiconductor buffer film between the DNA and the

evaporation usually destroys the DNA and prevents any current measurements.
After long exposure under vacuum or dry nitrogen, the conductivity strongly
decreases, leading to the conclusion that water molecules and ions in the

Voronoi polygons is known as the Dirichlet tessellation and used for grid
generation in computational fluid dynamics. From the hydrodynamics point of

exchange particles and information. To balance heterogeneous computing

based on the group $SO(10) \times SO(10) \times SO(10) \times U(1) \times
U(1)$. Each SO(10) group acts on a single generation. The $U(1) \times U(1)$ is
regarded as the hidden sector symmetry group. The supersymmetry is broken in
the hidden sector by the Fayet-Iliopoulos $D$-term for each group. The $D$-term
is needed also to circumvent the powerful non-renormalization theorem since the
$SO(10) \times SO(10) \times SO(10)$ is broken down to the usual SO(10) by the
pair condensation of certain messenger sector multiplets. The exchange of U(1)
gauge bosons gives an attractive force for the pair to be created and
condensed. The off-diagonal mass matrix elements among the generations in these
messenger sector multiplets are the source of the flavor dynamics including the
CP violation. The pair condensation of another multiplet in the messenger
sector leads to the doublet-triplet splitting. The SO(10) decuplet Higgs
couples only to one of the generations. The other couplings should, therefore,
be calculated as higher order corrections. We present our preliminary results

equation of energy of a point particle moving in a one-dimensional effective

submotives of Shimura varieties and automorphic representations of the
corresponding reductive groups, due to Langlands -- Arthur. In the present
paper these formulas are used in order to get explicit relations between
eigenvalues of $p$-Hecke operators (generators of the $p$-Hecke algebra of $X$)
on cohomology spaces of some of these submotives, for the case $X$ is a Siegel
variety. Hence, this result is conjectural as well: methods related to counting
points on reductions of $X$ using the Selberg trace formula are not used.
  It turns out that the above relations are linear, their coefficients are
polynomials in $p$ which satisfy a simple recurrence formula. The same result
can be easily obtained for any Shimura variety.
  This result is an intermediate step for a generalization of the Kolyvagin's
theorem of finiteness of Tate -- Shafarevich group of elliptic curves of
analytic rank 0, 1 over $Q$, to the case of submotives of other Shimura
varieties, particularly of Siegel varieties of genus 3.

the well-known construction of the real numbers using Dedekind cuts, the idea
is inspired by the ancient Greek theory of proportion, due to Eudoxus. However,
unlike the Dedekind construction, the construction proceeds directly from the
integers to the real numbers bypassing the intermediate construction of the
rational numbers.
  The construction of the additive group of the reals depends on rather simple
algebraic properties of the integers. This part of the construction can be
generalised in several natural ways, e.g., with an arbitrary abelian group
playing the role of the integers. This raises the question: what does the
construction construct? In an appendix we sketch some generalisations and
answer this question in some simple cases.
  The treatment of the main construction is intended to be self-contained and
assumes familiarity only with elementary algebra in the ring of integers and
with the definitions of the abstract algebraic notions of group, ring and
field.

degree (number of neighbours) of nodes for which defection is the final state
depends only on the network topology. This critical average degree is
considerably higher for clustered networks, than for distributed random
networks. This result strengthens the argument that clustering is the mechanism
which makes the development and maintenance of the cooperation possible.

down to 200Hz using a below threshold optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The
squeezed state phase was controlled using a noise locking technique. We show
that low frequency noise sources, such as seed noise, pump noise and detuning
fluctuations, present in optical parametric amplifiers have negligible effect
on squeezing produced by a below threshold OPO. This low frequency squeezing is
ideal for improving the sensitivity of audio frequency measuring devices such
as gravitational wave detectors.

continuous-variable entangled states by means of continuous interactions
(rather than collisions) between solitons in optical fibers are proposed.
First, quantum fluctuations around two time-separated single-component temporal
solitons are considered. Almost perfect correlation between the photon-number
fluctuations can be achieved after propagating a certain distance, with a
suitable initial separation between the solitons. The photon-number correlation
can also be achieved in a pair of vectorial solitons with two polarization
components. In the latter case, the photon-number-entangled pulses can be
easily separated by a polarization beam splitter. These results offer novel
possibilities to produce entangled sources for quantum communication and
computation.

particle in a harmonic potential, is studied focussing on its non-Markovian
regime. Both an analytic approach and a stochastic wave function approach are
used to describe the exact time evolution of the system. The border between two
very different dynamical regimes, the Lindblad and non-Lindblad regimes, is
identified and the relevant physical variables governing the passage from one
regime to the other are singled out. The non-Markovian short time dynamics is
studied in detail by looking at the mean energy, the squeezing, the Mandel
parameter and the Wigner function of the system.
