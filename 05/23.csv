observational consequences, such as triggering spiral structure in extended gas
disks. The orientation of the major axis is compared at 5 late snapshots of the
simulation. Halos with significant substructure or that appear otherwise
disturbed are excluded from the sample. We detect smooth figure rotation in 278
of the 317 halos in the sample. The pattern speeds follow a log normal
distribution centred at 0.148 h km/s/kpc with a width of 0.83. These speeds are
an order of magnitude smaller than required to explain the spiral structure of
galaxies such as NGC 2915. The axis about which the figure rotates aligns very
well with the halo minor axis, and also reasonably well with its angular
momentum vector. The pattern speed is correlated with the halo spin parameter,
but shows no correlation with the halo mass. The halos with the highest pattern
speeds show particularly strong alignment between their angular momentum
vectors and their figure rotation axes. The figure rotation is coherent outside
0.12 r_vir. The measured pattern speed and degree of internal alignment of the
figure rotation axis drops in the innermost region of the halo, which may be an
artifact of the numerical force softening. The axis ratios show a weak tendency
to become more spherical with time.

3E+17 g/s. Under these conditions, the spin periods of subsonic propellers are
limited within the range of 5-15 s, and the expected spin-down rates are close
to 7E-11 s/s. The mass accretion rate onto the stellar surface is limited to
the rate of plasma penetration into its magnetosphere at the boundary. As this
process is governed by the reconnection of the field lines, the accretion rate
onto the stellar surface constitutes 1-2% of M_c. In this case the X-ray
luminosity of the objects under consideration can be evaluated as 4E+35 erg/s.
The model predicts the existence of at least two spatially separated sources of
the X-ray emission: hot spots at the stellar surface, and the hot atmosphere
surrounding the magnetosphere of the star. The ages of the subsonic propellers
under the conditions of interest are limited to 10^5 yr.

comparable with dark energy density, the theory allows transition to new type
of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy Physics (CLEP) states is
demonstrated in a model of FRW universe filled with homogeneous scalar field
and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Neutrinos in CLEP state
are drawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their
own parameters. One of the features of the fermions in CLEP state is that in
the late time universe their masses increase as $a^{3/2}$ ($a=a(t)$ is the

neutrinos in CLEP state scales as a sort of dark energy; this cold dark matter
possesses negative pressure and for the late time universe its equation of

sphere {\bf S}^2_L is the Alekseev-Recknagel-Schomerus action which is a
particular combination of the Yang-Mills action and the Chern-Simons term .
Since the differential calculus on the fuzzy sphere is 3-dimensional the field
content of this model consists naturally of a 2-dimensional gauge field
together with a scalar fluctuation normal to the sphere . For U(1) gauge theory
we compute the quadratic effective action and shows explicitly that the tadpole
diagrams and the vacuum polarization tensor contain a gauge-invariant UV-IR
mixing in the continuum limit L{\longrightarrow}{\infty} where L is the matrix
size of the fuzzy sphere. In other words the quantum U(1) effective action does
not vanish in the commutative limit and a noncommutative anomaly survives . We
compute the scalar effective potential and prove the gauge-fixing-independence
of the limiting model L={\infty} and then show explicitly that the one-loop
result predicts a first order phase transition which was observed recently in
simulation . The one-loop result for the U(1) theory is exact in this limit .
It is also argued that if we add a large mass term for the scalar mode the
UV-IR mixing will be completely removed from the gauge sector . It is found in
this case to be confined to the scalar sector only. This is in accordance with
the large L analysis of the model . Finally we show that the phase transition
becomes harder to reach starting from small couplings when we increase M .

soliton solutions, of non-linear differential equations. In this paper we
present an invariant geometrical theory of Backlund transformations for second
order evolution equations with one space variable. The main concept is that of
connection defining the representation of zero curvature for a given partial
differential equation.
  The main result of this paper is a criterion of existence of Backlund
transformations for second order evolution equations with one space variable.
We find thegeneral form of a second order evolution equation that admits
Backlund transformations. Furthermore, for a special important class of
evolution equations we show that a Backlund transformation exists if and only
if the equation has one of two special forms. An equation of the first of these
types can be then reduced, by a change of variable, to the Burgers equation,
and the equation of the second type can be reduced to a well-known linear
equation.
  All differential-geometric considerations in this paper are local.

  centrifugation of the light source","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The experiment proposed aims to evidence and to measure the deflection of
light rays induced by the source speed upon emission, and to discern it from
the aberration of light rays induced by the observer speed. The method stands
in creating a speed asymmetry between that of the source and that of the
observer, and relies on the centrifugation of a light source at ultrahigh
speed. When source and observer have the same speed, such as when being both on
the same inertial system, the deflection and the aberration compensate and
their net effect is null. So, in order to circumscribe the odds of inertial
systems and to isolate these speed-induced effects it has instead been appealed
to a centrifugal system, since it allows infringing symmetry between the source
and the observer speeds. Three cases are considered. (a) Centrifugation of the
source fixed at one end of the rotor arm, while the detector is fixed on the
rotor axis. This configuration of the experiment aims to unveil that due to the
peripheral speed of the source the beam is deflected forward, so it impinges on
the centric detector slightly shifted from its position when the system was not
rotating. (b) The positions of the source and the detector are interchanged, so
the source peripheral speed is then null and thus no speed-induced deflection
ensues, but due to the observer peripheral speed there is a speed-induced
aberration since during the beam time-of-flight the detector has slightly moved
side-way. However, this time the spot shifts in opposite direction and hence
the effect of centrifugation is not reciprocal. (c) The source and the detector
are fixed at the two ends of the rotor arms. In this case the beam deflection
and aberration add, since their speed vectors have opposite directions and each
shift of the spot on the detector is double since the time-of-flight is double.

  aberration of stellar light","3 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  A telescope specifically designed for the observation of the stellar
aberration of light is proposed. It is distinctive in two main features: a
lengthy collimated beam and an adjustable position of the photo-detector along
the telescope axis, so the beam length-of-flight can be varied from zero to the
telescope total length. This is achieved by means of a telecentric objective
projecting the collimated beam up to a movable CCD camera. The spot position on
a high-resolution photo-detector array is recorded, and the data are
transferred to a computer and treated by a beam analyser software. The
telescope aims to measure with high accuracy the aberration of stellar light
due to the earth orbital motion. An alternative would consist of fixing the
telecentric objective at the top of a cliff by means of an anti-vibration clamp
with a high-precision directional mount. The detector would be fixed on a
micrometric positioner, placed on the foot of the cliff at the beam position of
fall. This way, the beam time-of-flight can be considerably increased, and
hence the subsequent spot shift. For a beam length of 300 m the resulting shift
would be of 30 mm, and so in a year the spot would describe a circle of 60 mm
diameter. Optionally, a diode laser may be fixed at the centre of the telescope
objective in order to contrast the behaviour of local and stellar light.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (22), 5188-5191 (2001)] shows that it is possible to
quantum compute using only a fixed entangled resource known as a cluster state,
and adaptive single-qubit measurements. This model is the basis for several
practical proposals for quantum computation, including a promising proposal for
optical quantum computation based on cluster states [M. A. Nielsen,
arXiv:quant-ph/0402005, accepted to appear in Phys. Rev. Lett.]. A significant
open question is whether such proposals are scalable in the presence of
physically realistic noise. In this paper we prove two threshold theorems which
show that scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation may be achieved in
implementations based on cluster states, provided the noise in the
implementations is below some constant threshold value. Our first threshold
theorem applies to a class of implementations in which entangling gates are
applied deterministically, but with a small amount of noise. We expect this
threshold to be applicable in a wide variety of physical systems. Our second
threshold theorem is specifically adapted to proposals such as the optical
cluster-state proposal, in which non-deterministic entangling gates are used. A
critical technical component of our proofs is two powerful theorems which
relate the properties of noisy unitary operations restricted to act on a
subspace of state space to extensions of those operations acting on the entire
state space.
