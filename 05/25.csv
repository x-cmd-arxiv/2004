arcmin^2 Hubble Ultra Deep Field NICMOS region based on a pronounced broad-band
discontinuity between the NICMOS F110W and F160W bandpasses. These galaxies
have red observed optical and near-infrared colors (AB_F775W - AB_F160W >= 2)
that cannot be explained entirely by dust reddening (indicating advanced age),
and their luminosities at rest-frame optical wavelengths suggest a substantial
stellar mass. One of the galaxies is detected in X-ray and is likely to have an
active nuclear region, while the rest are estimated to be at least 1 Gyr old at
z ~ 3 and contain total stellar mass of (0.4 - 9.1) x 10^{10} h^{-2} M_\odot.
We calculate a cumulative comoving stellar mass density of rho_star = 0.7 - 1.2
x 10^7 h M_\odot Mpc^{-3} for massive evolved galaxies of M > 10^9 h^{-2}
M_\odot at z>2.5. Comparison of the stellar mass density confined in galaxies
of different types shows that massive evolved galaxies contribute ~ 16 - 28% of
total stellar mass density even at these early epochs. Finally, an analysis of
their morphology observed in the ACS and NICMOS images shows that the active
galaxy has compact structure, while the rest are less concentrated. The
presence of massive evolved galaxies at z ~ 3, when the universe was only 2 Gyr
old, suggests that early star formation may have been particularly efficient in
massive halos.

even if the spectral line is integrated over frequencies. This regime that is
frequently employed in observations is characterized by a non-trivial relation
between the spectral index of velocities and the spectral index of intensity
fluctuations. For instance when density is dominated by fluctuations at large
scales, i.e. when correlations scale as r^{-\gamma}, \gamma<0, the intensity
fluctuations exhibit a universal spectrum of fluctuations ~K^{-3} over a range
of scales. When small scale fluctuations of density contain most of the energy,
i.e. when correlations scale as r^{-\gamma}, \gamma>0, the resulting spectrum
of the integrated lines depends on the scaling of the underlying density and
scales as K^{-3+\gamma}. We show that if we take the spectral line slices that
are sufficiently thin we recover our earlier results for thin slice data
without absorption. As the result we extend the Velocity Channel Analysis (VCA)
technique to optically thick lines enabling studies of turbulence in molecular
clouds. In addition, the developed mathematical machinery enables a
quantitative approach to solving other problems that involved statistical

velocity dispersion of a stellar group correlates with the age of this group,
according to a law proportional to t^0.26, where t is the age of the stellar
group. The temporal evolution of the vertex deviation is considered in detail.
It is shown that the vertex deviation does not seem to depend strongly on the
age of the stellar group. Previous studies in the literature seem to not have
found it due to the use of statistical ages for stellar groups, rather than
individual ages. The possibility to use the orbital parameters of a star to
derive information about its birthplace is investigated, and we show that the
mean galactocentric radius is likely to be the most reliable stellar birthplace
indicator. However, this information cannot be presently used to derive radial
evolutionary constraints, due to an intrinsic bias present in all samples
constructed from nearby stars. An extensive discussion of the secular and
stochastic heating mechanisms commonly invoked to explain the age-velocity
dispersion relation is presented. We suggest that the age-velocity dispersion
relation could reflect the gradual decrease in the turbulent velocity
dispersion from which disk stars form, a suggestion originally made by Tinsley
and Larson (1978) and supported by several more recent disk evolution
calculations. A test to distinguish between the two types of models using
high-redshift galaxies is proposed.

on the identification of an infall signature in the molecular line profiles of
tracer species. The classic infall signature is a double peaked line profile
with an asymmetry in the strength of the peaks such that the blue peak is
stronger. L1689B is a pre-stellar core and infall candidate but new JCMT HCO+
line profile data, presented here, confirms that both blue and red asymmetric
line profiles are present in this source. Moreover, a dividing line can be
drawn between the locations where each type of profile is found. It is argued
that it is unlikely that the line profiles can be interpreted with simple
models of infall or outflow and that rotation of the inner regions is the most
likely explanation. A rotational model is developed in detail with a new 3D
molecular line transport code and it is found that the best type of model is
one in which the rotational velocity profile is in between solid body and
Keplerian. It is firstly shown that red and blue asymmetric line profiles can
be generated with a rotation model entirely in the absence of any infall
motion. The model is then quantitively compared with the JCMT data and an
iteration over a range of parameters is performed to minmize the difference
between the data and model. The results indicate that rotation can dominate the
line profile shape even before the onset of infall.

between in situ measurements of electron density in HII regions, derived from

""filling factor"", the volume ratio of dense to tenuous gas, measured with
values of order 10^-3. Implicit in the filling factor model as normally used,
is the assumption that the clumps of dense gas are optically thin to ionizing
radiation. Here we explore implications of assuming the contrary: that the
clumps are optically thick. A first consequence is the presence within HII
regions of a major fraction of neutral hydrogen. We estimate the mean H^o/H^+
ratio for a population of HII regions in the spiral galaxy NGC 1530 to be the
order of 10, and support this inference using dynamical arguments. The
optically thick clumpy models allow a significant fraction of the photons
generated by the ionizing stars to escape from their HII region. We show, by
comparing model predictions with observations, that these models give an
account at least as good as, and probably better than that of conventional
models, of the radial surface brightness distribution and of selected spectral
line diagnostics for physical conditions within HII regions. These models
explain how an HII region can appear, from its line ratios, to be ionization
bounded, yet permit a major fraction of its ionizing photons to escape.

characterize the statistics of the singularity distribution in simulated
polarization maps, and make predictions that can be compared with ongoing and
upcoming observations. We use three different characterizations: the nearest
neighbor distance between singularities, the critical exponent \nu that
captures the scaling of total charge q within a closed curve of length L (q
\propto L^\nu), and the angular two point angular correlation functions for
singularities of similar and opposite charge. In general, we find that the
distribution of singularities is random except on scales less than about 10
deg, where singularities of the same charge repel and those of opposite charge
attract. These conclusions appear to be extremely robust with respect to
variations in the underlying cosmological model and the presence of
non-Gaussianity; the only exception we found are cases where statistical
isotropy is grossly violated. This suggests that, within the assumption of
statistical isotropy, the distribution is a robust feature of the last
scattering surface and potentially may be used as a tool to discriminate
effects that occur during photon propagation from the last scattering surface

understand this distribution and similar survey results, we model HI profiles
of gas discs and use simple simulations of objects having a wide range of HI
properties in the presence of an ionizing background. We find that inferred
column density (N_HI^o) values, which are found by averaging total HI masses
over some disc area, do not vary strongly with central column density (N_max)

However, populations of fairly massive objects having a wide range of central

halos based on hierarchical structure formation. This model assumes that
astration of normal stellar populations along with SNe II already occurs at
very high redshift. For halos that are not disrupted by SN II explosions, the
chemical evolution of the gas and stars is explicitly determined by the rate of
gas infall as compared with the astration rate and the corresponding rate of
metal production by SNe II per H atom in the gas. This model provides a good
description of the data on [Fe/H] for damped Ly alpha systems over a wide range
of redshift 0.5 < z < 5. For all halos not disrupted by SN II explosions, if
there is a cessation of gas infall, the metallicities of stars follow a bimodal
distribution. This distribution is characterized by a sharp peak at the value
of [Fe/H] corresponding to the time of infall cessation and by a broad peak at
a higher value of [Fe/H] corresponding to the subsequent period of astration
during which the bulk of the remaining gas forms stars. Such a distribution may
be compared to that observed for the Galactic halo stars. If the gas in a halo
is rapidly lost upon cessation of infall, then an assemblage of stars with a
very sharply-defined [Fe/H] value will be left behind. This assemblage of stars
may be accreted by a larger system and become a globular cluster of the larger
system. We also discuss the masses and metallicities of the globular clusters

galaxy cluster Abell 267. The object, which we call ""PALS1"", was found in a
survey aimed at identifying highly-magnified Lyman-break galaxies in the fields
of intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the source had U>24.7 (2-sigma;
AB), g=21.96, and very blue g-r and r-i colors; i.e., PALS1 was a U-band
drop-out, characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at z~3. However,
three months later the source had faded by more than three magnitudes. Further
observations showed a continued decline in luminosity, to R>26.4 seven months
after discovery. Though the apparent brightness is suggestive of a supernova at
roughly the cluster redshift, we show that the photometry and light curve argue
against any known type of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy
distribution and location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent
with the hypothesis that PALS1 is a gravitationally-lensed transient at z~3.3.
If this interpretation is correct, the source is magnified by a factor of 4-7
and two counterimages are predicted. Our lens model predicts time delays
between the three images of 1-10 years and that we have witnessed the final
occurrence of the transient. The intense luminosity (M(AB) ~ -23.5 after
correcting for lensing) and blue UV continuum (implying T>50,000 K) argue the
source may have been a flare resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a
10^6-10^8 solar-mass black hole. Regardless of its physical nature, PALS1
highlights the importance of monitoring regions of high magnification in galaxy
clusters for distant, time-varying phenomena.

of peculiar spectral behaviour, such as resonant scattering in ionic, atomic or
molecular lines, thermal SZ effect or extragalactic foreground emissions, whose
typical amplitude (denoted by $\epsilon$) is sufficiently smaller than the
intrinsic CMB fluctuations. We find that all these effects involve either the
autocorrelation of anisotropies generated during recombination ($z_{rec}$) or
the cross-correlation of those anisotropies with fluctuations arising at some
later redshift $z_i$. The degree of this correlation can be computed under the
assumption that density fluctuations were generated as standard inflationary
models dictate and that they evolved in time according to linear theory. In
case that the weak signal is frequency dependent, we show that, by substracting
power spectra at different frequencies, it is possible to avoid the limit
associated to Cosmic Variance and unveil weaker terms linear in $\epsilon$. We
find that the correlation term shows a different spectral dependence than the
squared ($\propto \epsilon^2$) term considered usually, making its extraction
particularly straightforward for the thermal SZ effect. Furthermore, we find
that in most cases the correlation terms are particularly relevant at low
multipoles and must be taken into account when characterising the power
spectrum associated to weak signals in the large angular scales.

debates. The standard synchrotron energy spectrum of cooling electrons F_E ~
E^{-1/2} is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectral
slopes. An alternative in the form of quasi-thermal Comptonization in a high
compactness source has difficulties in reproducing the peak of the observed
photon distribution below a few hundred keV. We show here that for typical
parameters expected in the GRB ejecta the observed spectra in the 20-1000 keV
BATSE energy range can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of the
synchrotron radiation in a partially self-absorbed regime. If the particles are
continuously accelerated/heated over the life-time of a source rather than
being instantly injected, a prominent peak develops in their distribution at a
Lorentz factor gamma ~ 30-100, where synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses are
balanced by acceleration and heating due to synchrotron self-absorption. The
synchrotron peak should be observed at 10-100 eV, while the self-absorbed
low-energy tail with F_E ~ E^2 can produce the prompt optical emission (like in
the case of GRB 990123). The first Compton scattering radiation by nearly
monoenergetic electrons can then be as hard as F_E ~ E^1 reproducing the
hardness of most of the observed GRB spectra. The second Compton peak should be
observed in the high energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the
emission detected by EGRET in GRB 941017. A significant electron-positron pair
production reduces the available energy per particle, moving the spectral peaks
to lower energies as the burst progresses. The regime is very robust, operates
in a broad range of parameter space and can explain most of the observed GRB
spectra and their temporal evolution.

of matter fluctuations. In the present work, by assuming that the observed
baryon content of clusters is representative of the universe, we show that the
mass temperature relation (M-T) can be specified for any cosmological model.
This approach allows one to remove most of the uncertainty coming from M-T
relation, and to provide an estimation of sigma\_8 whose uncertainty is
essentially statistical. The values we obtain are fortuitously almost
independent of the matter density of the Universe (sigma\_8 ~ 0.6-0.63) with an
accuracy better than 5%. Quite remarkably, the amplitude of matter fluctuations
can be also tightly constrained to similar accuracy from existing CMB
measurements alone. However, the amplitude inferred in this way in a
concordance model (Lambda-CDM) is significantly larger than the value derived
from the above method based on X-ray clusters. Such a discrepancy would almost
disappear if the actual optical thickness of the Universe was 0 but could also
be alleviated from more exotic solutions: the existence of a new dark component
in the Universe as massive neutrinos. However, recent other indications of
sigma\_8 favor a high normalization. In this case, the assumption that the
baryonic content observed in clusters actually reflects the primordial value
has to be relaxed : either there exists a large baryonic dark component in the
Universe or baryons in clusters have undergone a large depletion during the
formation of these structures. We concluded that the baryon fraction in
clusters is not representative and therefore that an essential piece of the
physics of baryons in clusters is missing in standard structure formation
scenario.

the potential. Generalising an approach developed for a standard Friedmann
cosmology, in \cite{delaMacorra:1999ff}, we show that the potential dependence
$V(\phi)$ can be described through a parameter $\lambda \equiv -\sqrt{2}
m_5^{3/2} V'/(\sqrt{H}V)$, where $m_5$ is the 5-dimensional Planck mass, $H$ is
the Hubble parameter and $V' \equiv \frac{dV}{d\phi}$. For the case where
$\lambda$ asymptotes to zero, we show that the solution exhibits stable
inflationary behaviour. On the other hand if it approaches a finite constant,
then $V(\phi) \propto \frac{1}{\phi^2}$. For $\lambda \to \infty$
asymptotically, we find examples where it does so both with and without
oscillating. In the latter case, the barotropic fluid dominates the scalar
filed asymptotically. Finally we point out an interesting duality which leads
to identical evolution equations in the high energy $\rho^2$ dominated regime

density and temperatures ranging from 300 to 450K are presented. Both
Car-Parrinello (CP) and Born-Oppenheimer (BO) molecular dynamics techniques are
compared for systems containing 54 and 64 water molecules. At 300K, excellent
agreement is found between radial distribution functions (RDFs) obtained with
BO and CP dynamics, provided an appropriately small value of the fictitious
mass parameter is used in the CP simulation. However, we find that the
diffusion coefficients computed from CP dynamics are approximately two times
larger than the corresponding BO simulations for T>400K, where statistically
meaningful comparisons can be made. Overall, both BO and CP dynamics at 300 K
yield overstructured RDFs and slow diffusion as compared to experiment. In
order to understand these discrepancies, the effect of proton quantum motion is
considered with the use of empirical interaction potentials. We find strong
evidence that proton quantum effects may have a larger impact than previously
thought on structure and diffusion of the liquid.

of semiflexible polymers depends not only on the details of the disorder but

effects can lead to the delocalization of a localized polymer with an increase
in either the disorder density or the stiffness. Our theory provides a general

phases could be stable in a vicinity of the critical point in the systems

ternary ABC block copolymers with a long middle block non-selective with

directed percolation, while for perfect immunization one obtains the general
epidemic process belonging to the universality class of dynamical percolation.
We focus on the critical behavior in the vicinity of the directed percolation
point, especially in high dimensions $d>2$. It is argued that the clusters of
immune sites are compact for $d\leq 4$. This observation implies that a
recently introduced scaling argument, suggesting a stretched exponential decay
of the survival probability for $p=p_c$, $p_0\ll p_c$ in one spatial dimension,
where $p_c$ denotes the critical threshold for directed percolation, should
apply in any dimension $d \leq 3$ and maybe for $d=4$ as well. Moreover, we
show that the phase transition line, connecting the critical points of directed
percolation and of dynamical percolation, terminates in the critical point of
directed percolation with vanishing slope for $d<4$ and with finite slope for
$d\geq 4$. Furthermore, an exponent is identified for the temporal correlation
length for the case of $p=p_c$ and $p_0=p_c-\epsilon$, $\epsilon\ll 1$, which
is different from the exponent $\nu_\parallel$ of directed percolation. We also
improve numerical estimates of several critical parameters and exponents,

usually associated with declarative languages, such as sets, rules and search,
into an imperative (functional) language. Although these paradigms are
separately well known and are available under various programming environments,
the originality of the CLAIRE language comes from the tight integration, which
yields interesting run-time performances, and from the richness of this
combination, which yields new ways in which to express complex algorithmic
patterns with few elegant lines. To achieve the opposite goals of a high
abstraction level (conciseness and readability) and run-time performance
(CLAIRE is used as a C++ preprocessor), we have developed two kinds of
compiler: first, a pattern pre-processor handles iterations over both concrete
and abstract sets (data types and program fragments), in a completely
user-extensible manner; secondly, an inference compiler transforms a set of
logical rules into a set of functions (demons that are used through procedural
attachment).

through the discovery of and tuning of meta-heuristics. The idea is to
represent a family of push/pull heuristics that are based upon inserting and

algorithm search for the best possible algebraic term, which represents a
hybrid algorithm for a given set of problems and an optimization criterion. In
a previous paper, we described this algebra in detail and provided a set of
preliminary results demonstrating the utility of this approach, using vehicle
routing with time windows (VRPTW) as a domain example. In this paper we expand
upon our results providing a more robust experimental framework and learning
algorithms, and report on some new results using the standard Solomon
benchmarks. In particular, we show that our learning algorithm is able to
achieve results similar to the best-published algorithms using only a fraction
of the CPU time. We also show that the automatic tuning of the best hybrid
combination of such techniques yields a better solution than hand tuning, with
considerably less effort.

i.e., the tension between the naturalness of the electroweak scale and the
precision measurements showing no evidence for new physics up to 5-10 TeV. In
little Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop
order from the quadratic divergence. This allows the cutoff to be raised up to
\~10 TeV, beyond the scales probed by the precision data. However, strong
constraints can still arise from the contributions of the new TeV scale
particles and hence re-introduces the fine-tuning problem. In this paper we
show that a new symmetry, denoted as T-parity, under which all heavy gauge
bosons and scalar triplets are odd, can remove all the tree-level contributions
to the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little Higgs theories
completely natural. The T-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of
little Higgs models by following the most general construction of the low
energy effective theory a la Callan, Coleman, Wess and Zumino. In particular,
we discuss in detail how to implement the T-parity in the littlest Higgs model
based on SU(5)/SO(5). The symmetry breaking scale f can be even lower than 500
GeV if the contributions from the unknown UV physics at the cutoff are somewhat
small. The existence of $T$-parity has drastic impacts on the phenomenology of
the little Higgs theories. The T-odd particles need to be pair-produced and
will cascade down to the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) which is stable. A
neutral LTP gives rise to missing energy signals at the colliders which can
mimic supersymmetry. It can also serve as a good dark matter candidate.

methods. The most interesting region corresponding to high frequency
oscillations is included in the analysis. The oscillations originate from some
new physics taking place at the beginning of the inflationary phase and
characterized by the new energy scale Mc. It is found that the standard
slow-roll model remains the most probable one given the first year WMAP data.
At the same time, the oscillatory models better fit the data on average, which
is consistent with previous works on the subject. This is typical of a
situation where volume effects in the parameter space play a significant role.
Then, we find the amplitude of the oscillations to be less than 22% of the mean
amplitude and the new scale Mc to be such that H/Mc < 6.6 x 10^(-4) at 1-sigma
level, where H is the scale of inflation.

Gradient Synchrotron of BNL to measure the nuclear transparency of nuclei
measured in the A(p,2p) quasielastic scattering process near 90 Deg .in the pp
center of mass. The incident momenta varied from 5.9 to 14.4 GeV/c,
corresponding to 4.8 < Q^2 < 12.7 (GeV/c)^2. First, we describe the
measurements with the newer experiment, E850, which had more complete kinematic
definition of quasielastic events. In E850 the angular dependence of the
nuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for
deuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier
experiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the
Carbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,
and Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)
nuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is
incompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber
calculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a
factor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak
the A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear
transparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level
again. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay
between two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and
perturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear
medium. We suggest a number of experiments for further studies of nuclear
transparency effects.

The program, written in Fortran 90/95 and based on techniques of second
quantization, irreducible tensorial operators, quasispin and the theory of
angular momentum, is intended to replace existing angular coefficient modules
from GRASP92. The new module uses a different decomposition of the coefficients
as sums of products of pure angular momentum coefficients, which depend only on
the tensor rank of the interaction but not on its details, with effective
interaction strengths of specific interactions. This saves memory and reduces
the computational cost of big calculations signficantly.

  phase maps using the Weighted Scaling Indices","4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.data-an",,"  We present a methodology for detecting non-linearities in data sets based on
the characterization of the structural features of the Fourier phase maps. A
Fourier phase map is a 2D set of points $M= \{(\phi_{\vec{k}}, \phi_{\vec{k} +
\vec{\Delta}})\}$, where $ \phi_{\vec{k}}$ is the phase of the $k$-mode of the
Fourier transform of the data set and $\vec{\Delta}$ a phase shift. The
information thus rendered on this space is analyzed using the spectrum of
weighted scaling indices to detect phase coupling at any scale $\vec{\Delta}$.
We propose a statistical test of significance based on the comparison of the
properties of phase maps created from both the original data and surrogate
realizations. We have applied our method to the Lorenz system and the
logarithmic stock returns of the Dow Jones index. Applications to higher
dimensional data are straightforward. The results indicate that both the Lorenz
system and the Dow Jones time series exhibit significant signatures of
non-linear behavior.

  1299",,,"physics.class-ph physics.hist-ph",,"  In this paper, we construct a parallel image of the conventional Maxwell
theory by replacing the observer-time by the proper-time of the source. This
formulation is mathematically, but not physically, equivalent to the
conventional form. The change induces a new symmetry group which is distinct
from, but closely related to the Lorentz group, and fixes the clock of the
source for all observers. The new wave equation contains an additional term
(dissipative), which arises instantaneously with acceleration. This shows that
the origin of radiation reaction is not the action of a ""charge"" on itself but
arises from inertial resistance to changes in motion. This dissipative term is
equivalent to an effective mass so that classical radiation has both a massless
and a massive part. Hence, at the local level the theory is one of particles
and fields but there is no self-energy divergence (nor any of the other
problems). We also show that, for any closed system of particles, there is a
global inertial frame and unique (invariant) global proper-time (for each
observer) from which to observe the system. This global clock is intrinsically
related to the proper clocks of the individual particles and provides a unique
definition of simultaneity for all events associated with the system. We
suggest that this clock is the historical clock of Horwitz, Piron, and Fanchi.
At this level, the theory is of the action-at-a-distance type and the
absorption hypothesis of Wheeler and Feynman follows from global conservation
of energy.

scheme to calculate the time-dependent wavefunction from a single-valued
continuum of trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a
single orbit. A natural language for the theory is offered by the hydrodynamic
analogy, in which wave mechanics corresponds to the Eulerian picture and the
particle theory to the Lagrangian picture. The Lagrangian model for the quantum
fluid may be developed from a variational principle. The Euler-Lagrange
equations imply a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation to
calculate the trajectories of the fluid particles as functions of their initial
coordinates using as input the initial wavefunction. The admissible solutions
are those consistent with quasi-potential flow. The effect of the superposition
principle is represented via a nonclassical force on each particle. The
wavefunction is computed via the standard map between the Lagrangian
coordinates and the Eulerian fields, which provides the analogue in this model
of Huygens principle in wave mechanics. The method is illustrated by
calculating the time-dependence of a free Gaussian wavefunction. The Eulerian
and Lagrangian pictures are complementary descriptions of a quantum process in
that they have associated Hamiltonian formulations that are connected by a
canonical transformation. The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which employs the
same set of trajectories, should not be conflated with the Lagrangian version
of the hydrodynamic interpretation. The theory implies that the mathematical
results of the de Broglie-Bohm model may be regarded as statements about
quantum mechanics itself rather than about its interpretation.

parallel notion of information deficit. Localisable information is defined as
the amount of information that can be concentrated by means of classical
communication and local operations where only maximally mixed states can be
added for free. The information deficit is defined as difference between total
information contents of the state and localisable information. We consider a
larger class of operations: the so called PPT operations, which in addition
preserve maximally mixed state (PPT-PMM operations). We formulate the related
optimization problem as sedmidefnite program with suitable constraints. We then
provide bound for fidelity of transition of a given state into product pure
state on Hilbert space of dimension d. This allows to obtain general upper
bound for localisable information (and also for information deficit). We
calculated the bounds exactly for Werner states and isotropic states in any
dimension. Surprisingly it turns out that related bounds for information
deficit are equal to relative entropy of entanglement (in the case of Werner
states - regularized one). We compare the upper bounds with lower bounds based
on simple protocol of localisation of information.

construct a general (analytic) representation theory for the square-root energy
operator of relativistic quantum theory, which is valid for all values of the
spin. We focus on the spin 1/2 case, considering a few simple yet solvable and
physically interesting cases, in order to understand how to interpret the
operator. Our general representation is uniquely determined by the Green's
function for the corresponding Schrodinger equation. We find that, in general,
the operator has a representation as a nonlocal composite of (at least) three
singularities. In the standard interpretation, the particle component has two
negative parts and one (hard core) positive part, while the antiparticle
component has two positive parts and one (hard core) negative part. This effect
is confined within a Compton wavelength such that, at the point of singularity,
they cancel each other providing a finite result. Furthermore, the operator
looks like the identity outside a few Compton wavelengths (cutoff). To our
knowledge, this is the first example of a physically relevant operator with
these properties.

full (minimal coupling) Dirac equation into particle and antiparticle
components. The diagonalization is analytic in that it is achieved without
transforming the wave functions, as is done by the Foldy-Wouthuysen method, and
reveals the nonlocal time behavior of the particle-antiparticle relationship.
We interpret the zitterbewegung and the result that a velocity measurement (of
a Dirac particle) at any instant in time is, as reflections of the fact that
the Dirac equation makes a spatially extended particle appear as a point in the
present by forcing it to oscillate between the past and future at speed c. From
this we infer that, although the form of the Dirac equation serves to make
space and time appear on an equal footing mathematically, it is clear that they
are still not on an equal footing from a physical point of view. On the other
hand, the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, which connects the Dirac and square
root operator, is unitary. Reflection on these results suggests that a more
refined notion (than that of unitary equivalence) may be required for physical
systems.
