test of any model for structure formation. We have tested the LCDM model with a
featureless, scale invariant primordial power spectrum by quantitatively
comparing the filamentarity in simulated LCRS slices with the actual data. The
filamentarity in an unbiased LCDM model, we find, is less than the LCRS.
Introducing a bias b=1.15, the model is in rough consistency with the data,
though in two of the slices the filamentarity falls below the data at a low
level of statistical significance. The filamentarity is very sensitive to the
bias parameter and a high value b=1.5, which enhances filamentarity at small
scales and suppresses it at large scales, is ruled out. A bump in the power
spectrum at k~0.05 Mpc/h is found to have no noticeable effect on the

except that GRB 021211's optical afterglow was intrinsically approximately 38
times fainter, and the transition from the reverse shock to the forward shock

The forward shock appears to have been expanding in a homogeneous ambient

of GRB 021211 may have a small opening angle and that the total gamma-ray

this is the case then it is possible that most of the energy of the burst is in
another form such as a frozen magnetic field, supernova ejecta, or a second jet

from the data, without the need for the specification of a theory of gravity,
and without adopting an a priori parameterization of the form or redshift
evolution of the dark energy. We use the latest set of distances to SN standard
candles from Riess et al. (2004), supplemented by data on radio galaxy standard
ruler sizes, as described by Daly and Djorgovski (2003, 2004). We find that the
universe transitions from acceleration to deceleration at a redshift of about
0.4. The standard ""concordance model"" provides a reasonably good fit to the
dimensionless expansion rate as a function of redshift, though it fits the
dimensionless acceleration rate as a function of redshift less well. The
expansion and acceleration rates are then combined with a theory of gravity to
determine the pressure, energy density, and equation of state of the dark
energy as functions of redshift. Adopting General Relativity as the correct
theory of gravity, the redshift trends for the pressure, energy density, and
equation of state of the dark energy out to redshifts of about one are
determined, and are found to be generally consistent with the concordance
model.

distributions of star clusters, with a primary focus on the large population of
clusters in the interacting Antennae galaxies. Some of the highlights of these
studies are the following: 1. The mass function of the young clusters (with
ages \tau < 10^8 yr) has power-law form, dN/dM propto M^{-2}, over the observed
range of masses, 10^4 < M < 10^6 solar masses. 2. The age distribution of the
clusters declines steeply at all ages, roughly as dN/d tau propto tau^{-1} for
mass-limited samples, indicating rapid disruption of most clusters. 3. At least
20% and possibly all stars form in clusters and/or associations, including
those that are unbound and short-lived. 4. Many of the clusters that remain
bound just after their formation are disrupted on longer timescales by a
combination of mass loss by stellar evolution and several stellar dynamical
processes. 5. The young clusters have a clumpy space distribution and are
located preferentially in regions of high interstellar density, at least when
averaged over scales of about a kpc. 6. The positions of the young clusters,
however, are not correlated with the local velocity gradients or velocity
dispersions in the interstellar medium. There are growing indications that most
of these conclusions also apply to the populations of young star clusters in
other galaxies, both interacting and quiescent.

different energies in the framework of multi-dimensional cosmological models.
In models with compactified extra-dimensions (Kaluza-Klein type models), the
main source of the photon time delay is the time variation of the
electromagnetic coupling, due to dimensional reduction, which induces an
energy-dependence of the speed of light. A similar relation between the fine
structure constant and the multi-dimensional gauge couplings also appears in
models with large (non-compactified) extra-dimensions. For photons of energies
around 1 TeV, propagating on cosmological distances in an expanding Universe,
the time delay could range from a few seconds in the case of Kaluza-Klein
models to a few days for models with large extra-dimensions. As a consequence
of the multi-dimensional effects, the intrinsic time profiles at the emitter
rest frame differ from the detected time profiles. The formalism developed in
the present paper allows the transformation of the predicted light curves of
various energy ranges of the emitter into the frame of the observer, for
comparison with observations. Therefore the study of energy and redshift
dependence of the time delay of photons, emitted by astrophysical sources at
cosmological distances, could discriminate between the different
multi-dimensional models and/or quantum gravity effects.

SPIRALS are consistent with a picture in which they have been accreted fairly
recently. They have mildly radial orbits and hardly populate the central
regions, most likely because they suffer tidal disruption. Finally, the
distribution and kinematics of the GALAXIES IN SUBSTRUCTURES, when taken at
face value, imply tangential velocity anisotropy for these galaxies, but this
result may be (partly) due to the procedure by which these galaxies are
selected. A first attempt to take the effects of selection into account shows
that isotropic (or even mildly radial) orbits of subcluster galaxies cannot be
excluded.

several spherical clouds along the line of sight. We consider three models:
global collapse of a very large (5 pc radius) cloud, localized collapse from
smaller (1 pc) clouds around individual H II regions, and multiple, static
clouds. For all three models we can find combinations of parameters that
reproduce the CS profiles reasonably well provided that the component clouds
have a core-envelope structure with a temperature gradient. Cores with high
temperature and high molecular hydrogen density are needed to match the higher
transitions (e.g. J=7-6) observed towards A and G. The lower temperature, low
density gas needed to create the inverse P-Cygni profile seen in the CS J=2-1
line (with 5"" beam) towards H II region G arises from different components in
the 3 models. The infalling envelope of cloud G plus cloud B creates the
absorption in global collapse, cloud B is responsible in local collapse, and a
separate cloud, G', is needed in the case of many static clouds. The exact
nature of the velocity field in the envelopes for the case of local collapse is
not important as long as it is in the range of 1 to 5 km/s for a turbulent
velocity of about 6 km/s. High resolution observations of the J=1-0 and 5-4
transitions of CS and C34S may distinguish between these three models. Modeling

to migrate in the direction of the force. Stationary shapes in the presence of

effects of the line tension of the island edge are neglected, and conditions
for the existence of non-singular stationary shapes can be formulated. In
particular, we analyse the dependence of the direction of island migration on
the relative orientation of the electric field to the crystal anisotropy, and
we show that no stationary shapes exist when the number of symmetry axes is
odd. The full problem including line tension is solved by time-dependent
numerical integration of the sharp-interface model. In addition to stationary

fields with H parallel (H_{c2}^{ab}) and perpendicular (H_{c2}^c) to the CuO_2

influence of solvent molecules on polymer conformations is modelled by a narrow
Gaussian excluded volume potential that acts pair-wise between the beads of the
chain. Brownian dynamics simulations data, acquired for chains of finite
length, and extrapolated to the limit of infinite chain length, are shown to be
model independent. This feature of the narrow Gaussian potential, which leads
to results identical to a $\delta$-function repulsive potential, enables the
prediction of both universal crossover scaling functions and asymptotic
behavior in the excluded volume limit. Universal viscometric functions,
obtained by this procedure, are found to exhibit increased shear thinning with
increasing solvent quality. In the excluded volume limit, they are found to
obey power law scaling with the characteristic shear rate $\beta$, in close
agreement with previously obtained renormalization group results. The presence
of excluded volume interactions is also shown to lead to a weakening of the
alignment of the polymer chain with the flow direction.

proposed absolute structure free replacement of Newtoninan mechanics, to Gauge
Theory and to the 3-space approach (TSA) formulation of GR. For the latter with

fields to describe nature can be accommodated in the TSA, and compare the TSA
with the `split spacetime formulation' of Kuchar. I explain the emergence of
broken and unbroken Gauge Theories as a consequence of the POE. I also consider
as further examples of the G-AF principle the further quotienting out of

solutions of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in three dimensions. We then prove a
local and global existence theorem for an elliptic affine two-sphere metric
with prescribed singularities. The metric cone over the two-sphere minus three
points yields a parabolic affine sphere with singularities along a ""Y""-shaped
locus. This gives a semi-flat Calabi-Yau metric in a neighborhood of the ""Y""
vertex.
  In the erratum, we correct a gap in the solution of the elliptic affine
sphere equation (with the small caveat that a parameter in the equation, the
cubic differential, must be smaller than we assumed before). The new proof
still allows us to construct semi-flat Calabi-Yau metrics in a neighborhood of
the ""Y"" vertex by appealing to the result of Baues-Cort\'es. We also give an
alternate construction of such semi-flat Calabi-Yau metrics by using a result
on hyperbolic affine spheres due to the first author.

recently into a much richer class of exactly-solvable models. We then show how
the Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between such
quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This is
then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit
of the pure pairing Hamiltonian and is followed by several applications to
problems of relevance to condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and the
physics of confined systems. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed
in the context of these exactly-solvable models include: (1) the crossover from
superconductivity to a fluctuation-dominated regime in small metallic grains,
(2) the role of the nucleon Pauli principle in suppressing the effects of high
spin bosons in interacting boson models of nuclei, and (3) the possibility of
fragmentation in confined boson systems. Interesting insight is also provided

multiphoton ionization of liquid water become power dependent when the radiance
of the excitation light is greater than 0.3-0.5 TW/cm^2 (the terawatt regime).
To elucidate the mechanism of this power dependence, tri- 400 nm photon
ionization of water has been studied using pump-probe laser spectroscopy on the
pico- and femtosecond time scales. We suggest that the observed kinetic
transformations are caused by a rapid temperature jump in the sample. Such a
jump is inherent to multiphoton ionization in the terawatt regime, when the
absorption of the pump light along the optical path becomes very nonuniform.
The heating of water is substantial (tens of degrees C) because the 3-photon
quantum yield of the ionization is relatively low, ca. 0.42, and a large
fraction of the excitation energy is released into the solvent bulk as heat.
Evidence of the temperature jump is the observation of a red shift in the
absorption spectrum of (thermalized) electron and by characteristic
""flattening"" of the thermalization dynamics in the near infra-red. The
temperature jump in the terawatt regime might be ubiquitous in multiphoton
ionization in molecular liquids. The implications of these observations for
femtosecond pulse radiolysis of water are discussed.

scatter experiment (Kline et al., submitted to PRL), the LDI and TPMI
thresholds cross in the range 0.28 < k \lambda_D < 0.34, consistent with the
observed LDI regime change. However, if \nu exceeds a critical value, estimated
to be order 1% of the electron plasma frequency, then TPMI is not possible at
any wavenumber.

low energy neutrons produced in the beam dump. To understand these backgrounds,
we have studied Helium- and Argon-filled ionization chambers exposed to intense
neutron fluxes from PuBe neutron sources ($E_n=1-10$ MeV). The sources emit
about 10$^8$ neutrons per second. The number of ion pairs in the chamber gas
volume per incident neutron is derived. While limited in precision because of a
large gamma ray background from the PuBe sources, our results are consistent
with the expectation that the neutrons interact purely elastically in the
chamber gas.

complex energy plane (E-plane) or indirectly in the complex angular momentum
plane (L-plane). Another formulation complementing these two approaches was
introduced recently. It is an indirect algebraic method that studies resonances
in a complex charge plane (Z-plane). This latter approach will be generalized
to provide a unified algebraic treatment of resonances in the complex E-, L-,
and Z-planes. The complex scaling (rotation) method will be used in the
development of this approach. The resolvent operators (Green's functions) are
formally defined in these three spaces. Bound states spectrum and resonance
energies in the E-plane are mapped onto a discrete set of poles of the
respective resolvent operator on the real line of the L- and Z-planes. These
poles move along trajectories as the energy is varied. A finite square
integrable basis is used in the numerical implementation of this approach.
Stability of poles and trajectories against variation in all computational
parameters is demonstrated. Resonance energies for a given potential are
calculated and compared with those obtained by other studies.

thickness measurements along any meridian from optical sections obtained using
a rotary scanning system. This paper presents 3-D mapping of the corneal
thickness and topography of both corneal surfaces, obtained with the rotary

sections obtained by illumination with a collimated beam expanded in a fan by a
small cylindrical lens. This lens is provided with motor driven rotation in
order to perform automated rotary scan of the whole cornea. Two cameras are
used to capture the images of the optical sections. Results: With this system
it is possible to obtain 3-D representation of the corneal thickness as well as
corneal topography. Corneal thickness and elevation maps are shown.
Conclusions: Although still under development, this new optical system allows
the measurement of the thickness of the whole cornea as well as 3-D mapping of
both corneal surfaces.

permits one to choose the operating wavelengths for each photon of a pair based
on optimizations of other system parameters (loss in optical fiber, photon
counter performance, etc.). The combination of spectral control, polarization
control, and lack of group-velocity matching conditions makes this technique
particularly well-suited for a distributed quantum information processing
architecture in which integrated optical circuits are connected by spans of
optical fiber.

two graph states are equivalent under the local Clifford group if and only if
there exists a sequence of local complementations which relates their
associated graphs. In this short note we report the existence of a polynomial
time algorithm, published in [Combinatorica 11 (4), 315 (1991)], which decides
whether two given graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations.
