kinematic center of the galaxy, and a more extended gas component associated
with the near-infrared bar. We model the line intensities of CO, HCN and 13CO
to infer the physical conditions of the gas in the nucleus of NGC 253. The
results indicate increased volume densities around the radio nucleus in a
twin-peaks morphology. Compared with the CO kinematics, the gas densities
appear highest near the radius of a likely inner Linblad resonance, and
slightly lead the bar minor axis. This result is similar to observations of the
face-on, twin-peaks galaxy NGC 6951, and is consistent with models of starburst

forecast constraints from combining CMB anisotropies with cosmic shear using a
spectroscopically determined redshift distribution, varying the number of
spectra $N_{spec}$ obtained from 64 to $\infty$. The source redshift
distribution is expanded in a Fourier series, and the amplitudes of each mode
are considered as parameters to be constrained via both the spectroscopic and

circumstances this is a good approximation (the sources are clustered and for
narrow spectroscopic surveys with many objects this results in the redshifts
being correlated). It is found that for the surveys considered and for a prior
of 0.04 on the calibration parameters, the addition of redshift information
make significant improvements on the constraints on the cosmological
parameters; however, beyond $N_{spec}\sim$few$\times 10^3$ the addition of
further spectra will make only a very small improvement to the cosmological
parameters. We find that a better calibration makes large $N_{spec}$ more

we used the ISOPHOT data together with HiRes IRAS data and ATCA/Parkes combined

this result implies a difference in the gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) 3 times larger

Such an approach allows us to take into account the effects of several features

to merger shocks,which cannot be investigated analitically or with usual
numerical simulations. Furthermore, we are able to simulate a set of clusters
which have properties quite similar to those of GCs observed in the nearby

regime passing smoothly to a small pitch angle diffusion regime at larger

decreases with $z$, with a scatter that is indicative of a range of
star--formation time-scales and redshift of formation. More important, the
typical M/L of massive early type galaxies is larger than that of less massive
ones, suggesting that their stellar population formed at higher z. The final
K20 galaxy sample spans a range of stellar masses from M*=10^9Msun to
M*=10^12Msun, with massive galaxies ($M*>10^11Msun) detected up to z~2. We
compute the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function at various z, of which we observe only
a mild evolution (i.e. by 20-30%) up to z~1. At z>1, the evolution of the GSMF
appears to be much faster: at z~2, about 35% of the present day stellar mass in
objects with M*~10^11Msun appear to have assembled. We also detect a change in
the physical nature of the most massive galaxies, since at z>1 a population of
massive star--forming galaxies progressively appears. We finally analyze our

the large number of massive galaxies detected at high z does not violate any

investigate from first principles the change in molecular conductance caused by
different atomic structures around the metal-molecule contact. Our motivation
is the variable situations that may arise in break junction experiments; our
approach is a combined density functional theory and Green function technique.
We focus on effects caused by (1) the presence of an additional Au atom at the
contact and (2) possible changes in the molecule-lead separation. The effects
of contact atomic relaxation and two different lead orientations are fully
considered. We find that the presence of an additional Au atom at each of the
two contacts will increase the equilibrium conductance by up to two orders of
magnitude regardless of either the lead orientation or different group-VI
anchoring atoms. This is due to a LUMO-like resonance peak near the Fermi
energy. In the non-equilibrium properties, the resonance peak manifests itself
in a large negative differential conductance. We find that the dependence of
the equilibrium conductance on the molecule-lead separation can be quite
subtle: either very weak or very strong depending on the separation regime.

temperature T, in contrast with the cubic dependence observed in crystals, and
which is well understood in terms of the Debye theory. That linear contribution
has been ascribed to the existence of two-level systems as postulated by the
Tunnelling Model. Therefore, a least-squares linear fit Cp = C_1 T + C_3 T^3
has been traditionally used to determine the specific-heat coefficients, though
systematically providing calorimetric cubic coefficients exceeding the elastic
coefficients obtained from sound-velocity measurements, that is C_3 > C_Debye.
Nevertheless, Cp still deviates from the expected C_Debye proportional to T^3
dependence above 1 K, presenting a broad maximum in Cp/ T^3 which originates
from the so-called boson peak, a maximum in the vibrational density of states
g(f)/f^2 at frequencies around 1 THz. In this work, it is shown that the
apparent contradiction between calorimetric and elastic Debye temperatures long
observed in glasses is due to the neglect of the low-energy tail of the boson
peak (which contribute as Cp proportional to T^5, following the Soft-Potential
Model). If one hence makes a quadratic fit Cp = C_1 T + C_3 T^3 + C_5 T^5 in

found within experimental error for several studied glasses.

inelastic cross sections were described in the distorted wave Born

transition density, quite different from that of a pure radial mode. In
contrast, the electron scattering amplitude S_1/2 is quite well described by a

the coupling to the multi-gluon field is much more important than the coupling
to the valence quarks. A multi-gluon (or sea-quark) transition density is
derived, which shows also breathing, indicating a rather complex multi-quark

  We extend the notion of Return to Equilibrium to systems possessing a
multitude of equilibrium states and show in particular that a condensate
coupled to a quantum dot has the property of Return to Equilibrium in a weak
coupling sense: any local perturbation of an equilibrium state of the coupled
system, evolving under the interacting dynamics, converges in the long time
limit to an asymptotic state. The latter is, modulo an error term, an
equilibrium state which {\it depends} in an explicit way on the local
perturbation (an effect due to long-range correlations). The error term
vanishes in the small coupling limit.

eigenvectors of the generator of the dynamics, called the Liouville operator.
Among our technical results is a Virial Theorem for Liouville type operators

in the form of sums of the fermionic functional integrals. The peculiarity of
the functional integrals in question is because of the fact that the
integration variables depend on the imaginary time ``automorphically''. In
other words, the integration variables are multiplied with a certain complex
number when the imaginary time is shifted by a period. Therefore, the
corresponding boundary conditions at the ends of the imaginary time segment are
not of the form corresponding to fermionic, or bosonic, variables taken in the
Matsubara representation at nonzero temperature. In fact, one part of sites of
the models corresponds to the integration variables which are subjected to the
unusual boundary conditions, while the variables on the other sites depend on
the imaginary time conventionally, i.e., as fermions (or bosons). Thus a
situation, when an ``automorphic'' boundary condition is the same for all sites
of a chain spin model, is generalized. The results of the functional
integration are obtained in the form of determinants of the matrix operators
which are regularized by means of the generalized zeta-function approach. The
partition functions of the models and certain correlation functions at nonzero
temperature are obtained explicitly thus demonstrating correctness of the
functional integral representations proposed.

  Math. Soc. 35 pages","Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 358 (2006), 1365-1401.",,,"math.DG math.SG",,"  We introduce a new method to perform reduction of contact manifolds that
extends Willett's (math.SG/0104080) and Albert's results. To carry out our
reduction procedure all we need is a complete Jacobi map $J$ from a contact
manifold $M$ to a Jacobi manifold $\Gamma_0$. This naturally generates the
action of the contact groupoid of $\Gamma_0$ on $M$, and we show that the
quotients of fibers of $J$ by suitable Lie subgroups are either contact or
locally conformal symplectic manifolds with structures induced by the one on
$M$.
  We show that Willett's reduced spaces are prequantizations of our reduced
spaces; hence the former are completely determined by the latter. Since a
symplectic manifold is prequantizable iff the symplectic form is integral, this
explains why Willett's reduction can be performed only at distinguished points.
As an application we obtain Kostant's prequantizations of coadjoint orbits.

exponents, particularly for the case of knots. This analog of the bracket
polynomial will be denoted {K} (with curly brackets) and called the binary
bracket polynomial. The key to the combinatorics of the invariant is an
interpretation of the state sum in terms of 2-colorings of the associated
diagrams. For virtual knots, the new invariant, J(K), is a restriction of the
writhe to the odd crossings of the diagram (A crossing is odd if it links an
odd number of crossings in the Gauss code of the knot. The set of odd crossings
is empty for a classical knot.) For K a virtual knot, J(K) non-zero implies
that K is non-trivial, non-classical and inequivalent to its planar mirror
image. The paper also condsiders generalizations of the two-fold coloring of
the states of the binary bracket to cases of three and more colors.
Relationships with graph coloring and the Four Color Theorem are discussed.

use of this Q-function, we calculate the quadrature fluctuations of the optical
system. From these results we infer that the signal-idler modes are in squeezed
states and the squeezing occurs in the first quadrature. When the NDPO operates
below threshold we show that, for a large squeezing parameter, a squeezing
amounting to a noise suppression approaching 100% below the vacuum level in the
first quadrature can be achieved.
