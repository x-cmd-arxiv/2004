GHz) images of the $\gamma$-ray bright, superluminal quasar 0827+243. The X-ray
jet bends sharply--by ~90 deg., presumably amplified by projection effects--5''
from the core. Only extremely weak radio emission is detected between the
nuclear region and the bend. The X-ray continuum spectrum of the combined
emission of the knots is rather flat, with a slope of $-0.4\pm 0.2$, while the
5-15 GHz spectra are steeper for knots detected in the radio. These
characteristics, as well as non-detection of the jet in the optical band by the
Hubble Space Telescope, pose challenges to models for the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of the jet features. The SEDs could arise from pure
synchrotron emission from either a single or dual population of relativistic
electrons only if the minimum electron energy per unit mass $\gamma_{\min}
\gtrsim 1000$. Alternatively, the X-ray emission could result from inverse
Compton scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background photons by electrons with
Lorentz factors as low as $\gamma \sim 15$. In all models, the bulk Lorentz
factor of the jet flow $\Gamma\gtrsim 20$ found on parsec scales must continue
without substantial deceleration out to 800 kpc (deprojected) from the nucleus.
Deceleration does appear to occur at and beyond the sharp bend, such that the
flow could be only mildly relativistic at the end of the jet.

of three from 2.7 keV to 0.9 keV at the cluster center. A mass deposition rate
of Mdot = 19 +6/-5 Msun/yr is measured. Complex structure is found in the very
inner regions of the cluster, including knots of emission and a clear deficit
of emission to the east of the cluster center. The bright X-ray structures are
located in the same regions as optical line emission, indicating that cooling
to low temperatures has occurred in these regions. The X-ray deficit is
spatially coincident with the eastern radio lobe associated with the active
galactic nucleus hosted by the central cD galaxy. The region surrounding the
X-ray hole is cool, and shows no evidence that it has been strongly shocked.
This joins the ranks of other cooling flow clusters with Chandra-detected
bubbles blown by central radio sources. This source is different than the other
well-known cases, in that the radio source is orders of magnitude less luminous
and has produced a much smaller bubble. Comparing the energy output of the
radio source with the luminosity of the cooling gas shows that energy
transferred to the ICM from the radio source is insufficient to offset the
cooling flow unless the radio source is currently experiencing a less powerful
than average outburst, and was more powerful in the past.

a coherent two-dimensional slab criss-crossed by filaments. The rotation axis
is found to align very well with the intermediate principal axis of the inertia
momentum tensor at this time. This orientation is approximately preserved
during the ensuing collapse, so that the rotation axis of the resulting disk
ends up lying on the plane traced by the protogalactic material at turnaround.
This suggests a tendency for disks to align themselves so that their rotation
axis is perpendicular to the minor axis of the structure defined by surrounding
matter. One example of this trend is provided by our own Galaxy, where the
Galactic plane is almost at right angles with the supergalactic plane (SGP)
drawn by nearby galaxies; indeed, the SGP latitude of the North Galactic Pole
is just 6 degrees. We have searched for a similar signature in catalogs of
nearby disk galaxies, and find a significant excess of edge-on spirals (for
which the orientation of the disk rotation axis may be determined
unambiguously) highly inclined relative to the SGP. This result supports the
view that disk galaxies acquire their angular momentum as a consequence of
early tidal torques acting during the expansion phase of the protogalactic

kinetic energy at the time of the transition to non-relativistic evolution,
t_NR ~ 40 d, is E_ST ~ (1-6)e51 erg. For GRB 970508 we find E_ST ~ 3e51 erg at

Frail, Waxman and Kulkarni (2000). This is due primarily to revised
cosmological parameters and partly to the maximum likelihood fit we use here.
Taking into account radiative losses prior to t_NR, the inferred energies agree
well with those derived from the early, relativistic evolution of the
afterglow. Thus, the analysis presented here provides a robust,
geometry-independent confirmation that the energy scale of cosmological GRBs is
about 5e51 erg, and additionally shows that the central engine in these two
bursts did not produce a significant amount of energy in mildly relativistic
ejecta at late time. Furthermore, a comparison to the prompt energy release

they possess significantly higher mass-to-light (M/L) ratios than their high
surface brightness counterparts, indicating that LSB galaxies may be dark
matter dominated. This interpretation is hampered by the difficulty of
disentangling the disc and dark halo contributions from the disc dynamics of
LSB galaxies. Recently, Fuchs (2002) has attempted such a disentanglement using
spiral arm density wave and swing amplification theory, allowing an independent
measurement of the disc mass; this work suggests that LSB discs are
significantly more massive than previously believed. This would considerably
reduce the amount of matter required in the dark halos in fitting the rotation
curves. Interestingly, the high mass-to-light ratios derived for the discs
appear inconsistent with standard stellar population synthesis models. In this
paper, we investigate whether the high M/L ratios for the Fuchs LSB discs might
be understood by adopting a very ``bottom heavy'' initial mass function (IMF).
We find that an IMF with a power law exponent of around alpha=3.85 (compared to
the standard Salpeter IMF, alpha=2.35) is sufficient to explain the unusually
high M/L ratios of the Fuchs sample. Within the context of the models, the blue
colours ((B-R)_0 < 1.0) of the sample galaxies result from being metal-poor

function and the spin--charge separation are introduced. The anomalous Green
function with adjustable parameters fits very well to the Fermi edge and the
low--energy part of ARPES along the $\Gamma-M$ line in the Brillouin zone. In
contrast to one--dimensional models with Luttinger--liquid behavior we find
that both the anomalous scaling $\alpha$ and the parameter $\delta$ describing
the spin--charge separation are momentum dependent. The higher--energy part of
the spectra is not accounted for by this simple Luttinger--liquid form of the
Green function. In this energy regime additional scattering processes are
plausible to produce the experimentally observed wide incoherent background,
which diminishes as the inverse of the energy.

and types have become important to many symbolic computation tasks. Systems
that support such representations usually depend on the implementation of an
intensional view of the terms of some variant of the typed lambda-calculus.
Various notations have been proposed for lambda-terms to explicitly treat
substitutions as basis for realizing such implementations. There are, however,
several choices in the actual reduction strategies. The most common strategy
utilizes such notations only implicitly via an incremental use of environments.
This approach does not allow the smaller substitution steps to be intermingled
with other operations of interest on lambda-terms. However, a naive strategy
explicitly using such notations can also be costly: each use of the
substitution propagation rules causes the creation of a new structure on the
heap that is often discarded in the immediately following step. There is thus a
tradeoff between these two approaches. This thesis describes the actual
realization of the two approaches, discusses their tradeoffs based on this and,
finally, offers an amalgamated approach that utilizes recursion in rewrite rule
application but also suspends substitution operations where necessary.

instanton vacuum. Based on the $\Delta S=0$ effective weak Hamiltonian from the
operator product expansion and renormalization group equations, we derive the
strangeness-conserving effective weak chiral Lagrangian from the instanton
vacuum to order ${\cal O}(p^2)$ and the next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$
expansion at the quark level. We find that the quark condensate and a dynamical
term which arise from the QCD and electroweak penguin operators appear in the
next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion for the $\Delta S =0$ effective
weak chiral Lagrangian, while they are in the leading order terms in the
$\Delta S = 1$ case. Three different types of the form factors are employed and
we find that the dependence on the different choices of the form factor is
rather insensitive. The low-energy constants of the Gasser-Leutwyler type are
determined and discussed in the chiral limit.

observational data in cosmology whereby signatures of string theory are clearly
distinguished from imprints of possible features on the inflaton potential. Our
method relies on the cross-correlations spectra of cosmic shear from large
scale structure (LSS) with the CMB temperature anisotropies and E-mode
polarization, by using the following properties: inflationary cosmology
provides only one source term for all CMB spectra and LSS which highly
constrains any deviations from the standard predictions; string theory can add
new non-inflationary channels to the source of perturbations as well as modify
clustering properties at large scales. Discrepancies in the source terms of
correlations and clustering properties provide the evidence for new physics.
Models of single-field inflation with a feature are disfavored even with
present data. Upcoming WMAP results and future data from weak lensing of LSS
will further improve our ability to probe new physics in this manner and could
open the first direct window to string theory.

Both cases of four and two components fermions are studied separately at
leading order in the $1/N $ expansion. Although a non-local Chern-Simons term
appears, in the four components case the photon is still massless leading to a
confining logarithmic potential similar to the classical one. In the two
components case, as expected, the parity breaking fermion mass term generates a
traditional Chern-Simons term which makes the photon massive and we have a
screening potential which vanishes at large inter-charge distance. The extra
non-minimal couplings have no important influence on the static potential at
large inter-charge distances. However, interesting effects show up at finite
distances. In particular, for strong enough non-minimal coupling we may have a
new massive pole in the photon propagator while in the opposite limit there may
be no poles at all in the irreducible case. We also found that, in general, the
non-minimal couplings lead to a finite range {\bf repulsive} force between
charges of opposite signs.

splitting of the ground state in hydrogen is considered. Improved calculations
are provided taking into account the most recent value for the proton charge
radius. Comparing experimental data with predictions for the hyperfine
splitting, the Zemach radius of the proton is deduced to be $1.045(16)$ fm.
Employing exponential parametrizations for the electromagnetic form factors we
determine the magnetic radius of the proton to be $0.778(29)$ fm. Both values
are compared with the corresponding ones derived from the data obtained in
electron-proton scattering experiments and the data extracted from a rescaled
difference between the hyperfine splittings in hydrogen and muonium.

the instantaneous eigenstates then the quantum number is an adiabatic invariant
and the state at a later time is equivalent to the instantaneous eigenstate at
that time apart from phase factors. Recently, Marzlin and Sanders have pointed
out that this could lead to apparent violation of unitarity. We resolve the
Marzlin-Sanders inconsistency within the quantum adiabatic theorem. Yet, our
resolution points to another inconsistency, namely, that the cyclic as well as
non-cyclic adiabatic Berry phases may vanish under strict adiabatic condition.
We resolve this inconsistency and develop an unitary operator decomposition
method to argue for the validity of the adiabatic approximation.

in classical mechanical terms. It is believed to be one characteristic of
superconductivity. The quantum state constructed by eta-pairing which
demonstrates ODLRO is an eigenstate of the three-dimensional Hubbard model.
Entanglement is a key concept of the quantum information processing and has no
classical counterpart. We study the entanglement property of eta-pairing
quantum state. The concurrence is a well-known measure of quantum entanglement.
We show that the concurrence of entanglement between one-site and the rest
sites is exactly the correlation function of the ODLRO for the eta-pairing
state in the thermodynamic limit. So, when the eta-pairing state is entangled,
it demonstrates ODLRO and is thus in superconducting phase, if it is a
separable state, there is no ODLRO. In the thermodynamic limit, the
entanglement between M-site and other sites of the eta-pairing state does not
vanish. Other types of ODLRO of eta-pairing state are presented. We show that
the behavior of the ODLRO correlation functions is equivalent to that of the
entanglement of the eta-pairing state. The scaling of the entropy of the
entanglement for the eta-pairing state is studied.

To be published in PRA",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.70.013814",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a method for producing on-demand single-photon states based on
collision-induced exchanges of photons and unbalanced linear absorption between
two single-mode light fields. These two effects result in an effective
nonlinear absorption of photons in one of the modes, which can lead to single
photon states. A quantum nonlinear attenuator based on such a mechanism can
absorb photons in a normal input light pulse and terminate the absorption at a
single-photon state. Because the output light pulses containing single photons
preserve the properties of the input pulses, we expect this method to be a
means for building a highly controllable single photon source.

also simultaneously control these solitons by using the coupling-light-induced
nonlinear waveguide.
