dust disks. Using the MIRAC-BLINC camera on the Magellan I (Baade) 6.5-m
telescope, we find that none of the stars have a statistically significant
N-band excess compared to the predicted stellar photospheric flux. Using three
different sets of assumptions, this null result rules out the existence of the
following around these post-T Tauri stars: (a) optically-thick disks with inner
hole radii of ~<0.1 AU, (b) optically-thin disks with masses of >10^{-6}
M_Earth (in ~1-micron-sized grains) within ~<10 AU of these stars, (c)
scaled-up analogs of the solar system zodiacal dust cloud with >4000X the
emitting area. Our survey was sensitive to dust disks in the terrestrial planet
zone with fractional luminosity of log(L_{dust}/L_{star}) ~ 10^{-2.9}, yet none
were found. Combined with results from previous surveys, these data suggest
that circumstellar dust disks become so optically-thin as to be undetectable at
N-band before age ~20 Myr. We also present N-band photometry for several
members of other young associations and a subsample of targets that will be

occurrence of thermal emission in the comoving frame of the shock wave giving
rise to the bursts. The determination of the luminosities and spectra involves
integration over an infinite number of Planckian spectra, weighted by
appropriate relativistic transformations, each one corresponding to a different
viewing angle in the past light cone of the observer. The relativistic
transformations have been computed using the equations of motion of GRBs within
our theory, giving special attention to the determination of the equitemporal
surfaces. The only free parameter of the present theory is the ``effective

observed hard-to-soft transition in GRBs is also presented. When applied to GRB

sample has a median [Fe/H] of -2.7 dex, extends to -3.5 dex, and is somewhat
less metal-poor than was expected from [Fe/H](HK,HES) determined from low
resolution spectra. Our analysis supports the existence of a sharp decline in
the distribution of halo stars with metallicity below [Fe/H] = -3.0 dex. So far
no additional turnoff stars with [Fe/H]}<-3.5 have been identified in our
follow up efforts. For the best observed elements between Mg and Ni, we find
that the abundance ratios appear to have reached a plateau, i.e. [X/Fe] is
approximately constant as a function of [Fe/H], except for Cr, Mn and Co, which
show trends of abundance ratios varying with [Fe/H]. These abundance ratios at
low metallicity correspond approximately to the yield expected from Type II SN
with a narrow range in mass and explosion parameters; high mass Type II SN
progenitors are required. The dispersion of [X/Fe] about this plateau level is
surprisingly small, and is still dominated by measurement errors rather than
intrinsic scatter. The dispersion in neutron-capture elements, and the
abundance trends for Cr, Mn and Co are consistent with previous studies of
evolved EMP stars. Two dwarfs in the sample are carbon stars, while two others
have significant C enhancements, all with C12/C13 ~ 7 and with C/N between 10
and 150. Three of these C-rich stars have large enhancements of the heavy
neutron capture elements, including lead, which implies a strong s-process
contribution, presumably from binary mass transfer; the fourth shows no excess
of Sr or Ba.

micro-patterned gas proportional counters opposite a planar drift electrode.
When combined with pixelized thin film transistor (TFT) array readouts, large
gas volumes may be imaged with very good spatial and energy resolution at
reasonable cost. The third dimension is determined by timing the drift of the
ionization electrons. The primary advantage of this technique is the very low
scattering that the charged particles experience in a gas tracking volume, and
the very accurate determination of the initial particle momenta that is thus
achieved. We consider two applications of PMWDs to gamma-ray astronomy: 1) A
tracker for an Advanced Compton Telescope (ACT) in which the recoil electron
from the initial Compton scatter may be accurately tracked, greatly reducing
the telescope's point spread function and increasing its polarization
sensitivity; and 2) an Advanced Pair Telescope (APT) whose angular resolution
is limited primarily by the nuclear recoil and which achieves useful
polarization sensitivity near 100 MeV. We have performed Geant4 simulations of
both these concepts to estimate their angular resolution and sensitivity for
reasonable mission designs.

morphological and spectral information of the diffuse emission: the radio
mini-halo is extended on a scale comparable to that of the cooling flow region

steep spectrum which steepens with distance from the center. We then applied to
this new mini-halo source a model for particle re-acceleration in cooling flows

properties (brightness profile, integrated radio spectrum and radial spectral
steepening) can be accounted for by the synchrotron radiation from relic
relativistic electrons in the cluster, which are efficiently re-accelerated by
MHD turbulence amplified by the compression of the cluster magnetic field in

Wiedemann-Franz law. We develop a local, quantum kinetic equation approach in
which the charge and energy conservation laws are explicitly obeyed. To obtain
the local description, we introduce bosonic distribution functions for the
neutral, low-energy collective modes (electron-hole pairs). The resulting
system of kinetic equations enables us to distinguish between the different
physical processes involved in the charge and energy transport: elastic
electron scattering affects both, while the inelastic processes influence only
the latter. Moreover, the neutral bosons, though incapable of transporting
charge, contribute significantly to the energy transport. In our approach we
calculate on equal footing the electrical and thermal conductivities and the
specific heat in any dimension. We found that the Wiedemann-Franz law is always
violated by the interaction corrections; the violation is larger for one- and
two-dimensional systems in the diffusive regime $T\tau \ll \hbar$ and it is due
to the energy transported by the neutral bosons. For two-dimensional systems in
the quasi-ballistic regime $T\tau \gg \hbar$ the inelastic scattering of the
electron on the bosons also contributes to the violation.

propagator (FP) to obtain dynamically generated chirally asymmetric solution in
an arbitrary covariant gauge $\xi$ is a complicated exercise specially if one
employs a sophisticated form of the fermion-boson interaction complying with
the key features of a gauge field theory. However, constraints of gauge
invariance can help construct such a solution without having the need to solve
the Schwinger-Dyson equation for every value of $\xi$. In this article, we
propose and implement a method to carry out this task in quenched quantum
electrodynamics in a plane (QED3). We start from an approximate analytical form
of the solution of the SDE for the FP in the Landau gauge. We consider the
cases in which the interaction vertex (i) is bare and (ii) is full. We then
apply the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations (LKFT) on the dynamically
generated solution and find analytical results for arbitrary value of $\xi$. We
also compare our results with exact numerical solutions available for a small
number of values of $\xi$ obtained through a direct analysis of the
corresponding SDE.

explored. An atomic dipole of a cold Rydberg atom is arranged in appropriate
electric and magnetic field, so that the motion of the dipole is constrained to
be planar and rotationally symmetric. Spatial noncommutativity leads to that
the canonical angular momentum possesses fractional values. In the limit of
vanishing kinetic energy, the dominate value of the lowest canonical angular
momentum takes $\hbar/2$. Furthermore, in the limit of eliminating magnetic
field, the dominate value of the lowest canonical angular momentum changes from
$\hbar/2$ to $\hbar/4$. This result is a clear signal of spatial
noncommutativity. An experimental verification of this prediction is suggested.

of a configuration of N D3-branes in the vicinity of four D7-branes and an
orientifold 7-plane in type I' string theory. The field theory contains
hypermultiplets in the second rank anti-symmetric and in the fundamental
representations. The Higgs branch has a dual description in terms of gauge
field configurations with non-zero instanton number on the world-volume of the
D7-branes. In this setting the non-renormalisation of the metric on the Higgs
branch implies constraints on the alpha' corrections to the D7-brane effective
action, including couplings to the curvature and five-form field strength. In
the second part of the paper we discuss non-renormalisation properties of BPS
Wilson lines, which are closely related to the physics of the Higgs branch.
Using a formulation of the four-dimensional N=2 theory in terms of a
three-dimensional N=2 superspace we show that the expectation value of certain
Wilson-line operators with hypermultiplets at the end points is independent of
the length and thus coincides with the expectation value of the local operators
parametrising the Higgs branch.

(pseudo-)Riemannian manifold to be conformal to an Einstein manifold. We also
construct invariants which give necessary and sufficient conditions for a
metric to be conformally related to a metric with vanishing Cotton tensor. One
set of invariants we derive generalises the set of invariants in dimension four
obtained by Kozameh, Newman and Tod. For the conformally Einstein problem,
another set of invariants we construct gives necessary and sufficient
conditions for a wider class of metrics than covered by the invariants recently
presented by M. Listing. We also show that there is an alternative
characterisation of conformally Einstein metrics based on the tractor
connection associated with the normal conformal Cartan bundle. This plays a key
role in constructing some of the invariants. Also using this we can interpret
the previously known invariants geometrically in the tractor setting and relate
some of them to the curvature of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric.

with a given number of points on its Jacobian. This method has important
applications in cryptography, where groups of prime order are used as the basis
for discrete-log based cryptosystems. Our algorithm provides an alternative to
the traditional CM method for constructing genus 2 curves. For a quartic CM
field K with primitive CM type, we compute the Igusa class polynomials modulo p
for certain small primes p and then use the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and
a bound on the denominators to construct the class polynomials. We also provide
an algorithm for determining endomorphism rings of ordinary Jacobians of genus
2 curves over finite fields, generalizing the work of Kohel for elliptic
curves.

units (CGU) as connectivity patterns which can serve as the nodes of a
coarse-grained network, and present algorithms to detect them. We use this
approach to systematically reverse-engineer electronic circuits, forming
understandable high-level maps from incomprehensible transistor wiring: first,
a coarse-grained version in which each node is a gate made of several
transistors is established. Then, the coarse-grained network is itself
coarse-grained, resulting in a high-level blueprint in which each node is a
circuit-module made of multiple gates. We apply our approach also to a
mammalian protein-signaling network, to find a simplified coarse-grained
network with three main signaling channels that correspond to cross-interacting
MAP-kinase cascades. We find that both biological and electronic networks are
'self-dissimilar', with different network motifs found at each level. The
present approach can be used to simplify a wide variety of directed and
nondirected, natural and designed networks.
