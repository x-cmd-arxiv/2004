scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons via free-electrons
leads to a new anisotropy contribution to the temperature distribution. If the
reionization process is inhomogeneous and patchy, the era of reionization is
also visible via brightness temperature fluctuations in the redshifted 21 cm
line emission from neutral Hydrogen. Since regions containing electrons and
neutral Hydrogen are expected to trace the same underlying density field, the
two are (anti) correlated and this is expected to be reflected in the
anisotropy maps via a correlation between arcminute-scale CMB temperature and
the 21 cm background. In terms of the angular cross-power spectrum,
unfortunately, this correlation is insignificant due to a geometric
cancellation associated with second order CMB anisotropies. The same
cross-correlation between ionized and neutral regions, however, can be studied
using a bispectrum involving large scale velocity field of ionized regions from
the Doppler effect, arcminute scale CMB anisotropies during reionization, and
the 21 cm background. While the geometric cancellation is partly avoided, the
signal-to-noise ratio related to this bispectrum is reduced due to the large
cosmic variance related to velocity fluctuations traced by the Doppler effect.
Unless the velocity field during reionization can be independently established,
it is unlikely that the correlation information related to the relative
distribution of ionized electrons and regions containing neutral Hydrogen can
be obtained with a combined study involving CMB and 21 cm fluctuations.

of 48\dg (evening sky) to 334\dg (morning sky) plus observations near +47\dg
and +90\dg ecliptic latitude. The spectra show a clear prograde kinematic
signature that is inconsistent with dust confined to the ecliptic plane and in
circular orbits influenced only by the sun's gravity. In particular, the
broadened widths of the profiles, together with large amplitude variations in
the centroid velocity with elongation angle, indicate that a significant
population of dust is on eccentric orbits. In addition, the wide, flat-bottomed
line profile toward the ecliptic pole indicates a broad distribution of orbital
inclinations extending up to about 30\dg - 40\dg with respect to the ecliptic
plane. The absence of pronounced asymmetries in the shape of the profiles
limits the retrograde population to less than 10% of the prograde population
and also places constraints on the scattering phase function of the particles.

amplitude asymmetry reported in some earlier investigations. The reduction of
the spectra included the discovery and removal of extremely faint, unidentified
terrestrial emission lines that contaminate and distort the underlying Mg I

lower signal-to-noise observations, but it probably affected the line centroid

structures known as superbubbles, inside which the subsequent supernovae (SNe)
explode, in tight space and time correlation. Acknowledging this fact, we
investigate four main questions: 1) does the clustering of massive stars and SN
explosions influence the particle acceleration process usually associated with
SNe, and induce collective effects which would not manifest around isolated
supernova remnants?; 2) does it make a difference for the general phenomenology
of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs), notably for their energy spectrum and
composition?; 3) can this help alleviate some of the problems encountered
within the standard GCR source model?; and 4) Is the link between superbubbles
and energetic particles supported by observational data, and can it be further
tested and constrained? We argue for a positive answer to all these questions.
Theoretical, phenomenological and observational aspects are treated in separate
papers. Here, we discuss the interaction of massive stellar winds and SN shocks
inside superbubbles and indicate how this leads to specific acceleration
effects. We also show that due to the high SN explosion rate and low diffusion
coefficient, low-energy particles experience repeated shock acceleration inside
superbubbles.

call ""orbital roulette"", checks the randomness of the phases. The method has
the following advantages: (1) It estimates accurately Keplerian (point-mass)
potentials as well as non-Keplerian potentials where the unknown gravitating
mass is distributed in space. (2) It is a complete statistical estimator: it
checks a trial potential and accepts it or rules it out with a certain
significance level; the best-fit measurement is thus supplemented with error
bars at any confidence level. (3) It needs no a priori assumptions about the

thick- and thin-disk stars. The increase in [Na/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] for
metal-rich stars found by Edvardsson et al. (1993) is confirmed. Our results
suggest that sodium yields increase with the metallicity, and quite large
amounts of sodium may be produced by AGB stars. We find that [Na/Fe]ratios,
together with either [Mg/Fe] ratio, kinematic data or stellar evolutionary
ages, make possible the individual discrimination between thin- and thick-disk
membership.

for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies, but is found in galaxies

natural consequence of heating concentrated at the footpoints of the loop, but

explore whether other alternatives can exist, i.e. distinct from obvious ones
resting on large age range. The data show that both normal, field and
interacting galaxies have the same scattered but smooth distribution in the Hb

span larges ranges of ages and metallicities. (2) The bulk population of stars
is old but subsequent episodes of star formation scatter the object in the

observed distribution. The above schemes are too demanding because of the many
ad hoc ingredients that have to be introduced. Furthermore they neglect the
observationally grounded hint that the stellar content of EGs is likely
enhanced in alfa-elements. We propose here a new scheme, in which the bulk
dispersion of galaxies in the index-index plane is caused by a different mean
degree of enhancement. The possibility that EGs span large ranges of [alpha/Fe]

monolithic scheme.

either trace the maximum angular momentum during the galaxy formation epoch, or
are associated with global star formation thresholds. Depending on their true
physical nature, these outer edges may represent an improved size
characteristic (e.g., as compared to D_25) and might contain fossil evidence
imprinted by the galaxy formation and evolutionary history. We will address
several observational aspects of disk truncations: their existence, not only in
normal HSB galaxies, but also in LSB and even dwarf galaxies; their detailed
shape, not sharp cut-offs as thought before, but in fact demarcating the start
of a region with a steeper exponential distribution of starlight; their
possible association with bars; as well as problems related to the

star-formation threshold model, but more work is necessary to implement the
truncations as adequate parameters characterising galactic disks.

features or expand and develop into granules. (b) Former PGs and G-band bright

also determine the pressure, energy density, and equation of state of the dark

universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration at a redshift of about
0.4, and the present value of deceleration parameter is -0.35 +/- 0.15. The
standard ``concordance model'' provides a reasonably good fit to the
dimensionless expansion rate as a function of redshift, though it fits the
dimensionless acceleration rate as a function of redshift less well. Adopting
General Relativity as the theory of gravity, we obtain the redshift trends for
the pressure, energy density, and equation of state of the dark energy out to a

harrassed fragile galaxies, in the dense cores of low mass galaxies, at the

high pressures make massive clouds at high densities. The result of this
process is usually only one or two YMC without the usual morphologies of local
star formation, i.e., without hierarchical structure and a continuous power law
distribution of cluster masses up to the largest mass. The other operates in
the more usual way: continuously for long periods of time in large parts of the
interstellar medium where the ambient pressure is already high as a result of
the deep potential well from background stars and other gas. This second
process makes clusters in a hierarchical fashion with size-of-sample effects,

identified as the source of current induced magnetic reversal; in the one
advocated herein the spin torque arises from the spin accumulation transverse
to the magnetization of a magnetic layer. These two states have quite different
attributes which should be discerned by current experiments.

impurity polarizes conduction electrons in its vicinity and forms a large
magnetic droplet with moment M>>S. At not too low temperatures, the strongly
damping paramagnon modes of the conduction electrons suppress large quantum
fluctuations (or spin flips) of this droplet. We show that the susceptibility
follows the law $\chi_{dc}(T)=(M^{2}/T)[1-(\pi g)^{-1}\ln(gE_{0}/T)]$, where
the parameter g>>1 describes the strong damping by conduction electrons, and
E_0 is the bandwidth of paramagnon modes. At exponentially low temperatures T
<< T_{*} ~ E_{0}\exp(-\pi g/2) we show that spin flips cannot be ignored. In
this regime we find that $\chi_{dc}(T) \approx \chi_{dc}(0)

exponentially large in g. We also discuss these effects in the context of the

equations that result from accurate free energy expressions for the fluid and
solid phases, while accounting fully for size fractionation between coexisting
phases. Fluids up to the largest polydispersities that we can study (around
14%) can phase separate by splitting off a solid with a much narrower size
distribution. This shows that experimentally observed terminal polydispersities
above which phase separation no longer occurs must be due to non-equilibrium
effects. We find no evidence of re-entrant melting; instead, sufficiently
compressed solids phase separate into two or more solid phases. Under
appropriate conditions, coexistence of multiple solids with a fluid phase is
also predicted. The solids have smaller polydispersities than the parent phase
as expected, while the reverse is true for the fluid phase, which contains
predominantly smaller particles but also residual amounts of the larger ones.
The properties of the coexisting phases are studied in detail; mean diameter,
polydispersity and volume fraction of the phases all reveal marked
fractionation. We also propose a method for constructing quantities that
optimally distinguish between the coexisting phases, using Principal Component
Analysis in the space of density distributions. We conclude by comparing our
predictions to perturbative theories for near-monodisperse systems and to Monte
Carlo simulations at imposed chemical potential distribution, and find
excellent agreement.

discussed and applied in the investigation of strained heteroepitaxial crystal
growth. As a starting point, we study a simplifying (1+1)-dimensional situation
with inter-atomic interactions given by simple pair-potentials. The model
exhibits the appearance of strain-induced misfit dislocations at a
characteristic film thickness. In our simulations we observe a power law
dependence of this critical thickness on the lattice misfit, which is in
agreement with experimental results for semiconductor compounds. We furthermore
investigate the emergence of strain induced multilayer islands or ""Dots"" upon
an adsorbate wetting layer in the so-called Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth
mode. At a characteristic kinetic film thickness, a transition from monolayer
to multilayer islands occurs. We discuss the microscopic causes of the
SK-transition and its dependence on the model parameters, i.e. lattice misfit,
growth rate, and substrate temperature.

are able to detect the NMR signal below about 15 K, which is a conclusive proof
for the existence of non-magnetic Co ions (Co3+ - low-spin 3d6, in addition to
magnetic Co ions) at least in a narrow temperature range around 10 K, thereby
resolving a controversy on this issue in the literature. In addition, we find
that the spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times undergo a dramatic
increase below about 12 K, with a profound influence on the intensity of the
NMR signal as a function of temperature, providing a microscopic evidence for
the existence of 12K-transition. The spectral features present quite an
interesting situation.

opportunities play in pricing financial derivatives. We use a non-equilibrium
model to set up a stochastic portfolio, and for the random arbitrage return, we
choose a stationary ergodic random process rapidly varying in time. We exploit
the fact that option price and random arbitrage returns change on different
time scales which allows us to develop an asymptotic pricing theory involving
the central limit theorem for random processes. We restrict ourselves to
finding pricing bands for options rather than exact prices. The resulting
pricing bands are shown to be independent of the detailed statistical
characteristics of the arbitrage return. We find that the volatility ``smile''
can also be explained in terms of random arbitrage opportunities.

perspective obtained in analyzing a gas via its molecules rather than its bulk
properties is analogous to this ""second atomization"". In this atomization,
space-time itself (i.e. the meter and the second) is effectively atomized, so
the atoms themselves must exist in a 'subspace'.
  Here we build a simple model of such a space-time from the ground up,
establishing a route for more complete theories, and enabling a review of
recent work. We first introduce the motivation behind statistical
interpretations and atomism, and look at applications to the realm of dynamic
space-time theories. We then consider models of kinetic media in subspace
compatible with our understanding of light. From the equations governing the
propagation of light in subspace we can build a metric geometry, describing the
dynamic and physical space-time of general relativity. Finally, implications of
the theory on current frontiers of general relativity including cosmology,
black holes, and quantum gravity are discussed.

importance for the nonperturbative low-energy dynamics of light quarks and
gluons. Lattice field theory provides a theoretical framework in which these
dynamics can be studied from first principles. The implementation of chiral
symmetry on the lattice is a nontrivial issue. In particular, local lattice
fermion actions with the chiral symmetry of the continuum theory suffer from
the fermion doubling problem. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation implies L\""uscher's
lattice variant of chiral symmetry which agrees with the usual one in the
continuum limit. Local lattice fermion actions that obey the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation have an exact chiral symmetry, the correct axial anomaly, they obey a
lattice version of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and still they do not
suffer from the notorious doubling problem. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation is
satisfied exactly by Neuberger's overlap fermions which are a limit of Kaplan's
domain wall fermions, as well as by Hasenfratz and Niedermayer's classically
perfect lattice fermion actions. When chiral symmetry is nonlinearly realized
in effective field theories on the lattice, the doubling problem again does not
arise. This review provides an introduction to chiral symmetry on the lattice
with an emphasis on the basic theoretical framework.

embedded into supergravity with FI terms. The energy of these strings is

We first reduce the problem in Minkowski space to an infinite set of field
equations on de Sitter space one dimension lower. These equations are quite
remarkable: they describe massless and massive gravitons in de Sitter space. In
particular, the partially massless graviton appears naturally in this
reduction. In the second step we solve the graviton field equations and
identify the holographic boundary data. Finally, we consider the asymptotic
form of the black hole space-time and identify the way the information about

including the MSW matter effect. Though interesting in their own right, these
relations are used to choose the physical region of the mixing angles such that
oscillations are parameterized completely and uniquely. We propose that the
preferred way of setting the bounds on the mixing angles should be $\theta_{12}
\in [0,\pi/2]$, $\theta_{13} \in [-\pi/2,\pi/2]$, $\theta_{23}\in [0,\pi/2]$,
and $\delta \in [0,\pi)$. No CP violation then results simply from setting
$\delta=0$. In the presence of the MSW effect, this choice of bounds is a new
result. Since the size of the asymmetry about $\theta_{13} = 0$ is dependent on
the details of the data analysis and is a part of the results of the analysis,
we argue that the negative values of $\theta_{13}$ should not be ignored.

flavor form Cooper pairs are investigated. In these phases, a Cooper pair
carries total spin one. A systematic classification of theoretically possible
phases, discriminated by the color-spin structure of the order parameter and
the respective symmetry breaking pattern, is presented. In the weak-coupling
limit, i.e., for asymptotically high densities, a universal form of the QCD gap
equation is derived, applicable to arbitrary color-superconducting phases. It
is applied to several spin-one and spin-zero phases in order to determine their
energy gaps and critical temperatures. In some of the spin-one phases the
resulting gap function is anisotropic and has point or line nodes. It is shown
that the phases with two different gaps violate the well-known BCS relation
between the critical temperature and the zero-temperature gap. Moreover, the
screening properties of color superconductors regarding gluons and photons are
discussed. In particular, it turns out that, contrary to spin-zero color
superconductors, spin-one color superconductors exhibit an electromagnetic
Meissner effect. This property is proven by symmetry arguments as well as by an
explicit calculation of the gluon and photon Meissner masses.

tetrad field, is investigated. The approach was pursued by Einstein in a number
of publications that appeared in the period from summer 1928 until spring 1931.
In the historical analysis special attention is given to the question of how
Einstein tried to find field equations for the tetrads. We claim that it was
the failure to find and justify a uniquely determined set of acceptable field
equations which eventually led to Einstein's abandoning of this approach. We
comment on some historical and systematic similarities between the

of {\it environment - assisted invariance} or {\it envariance}, a recently
discovered symmetry exhibited by entangled quantum systems. Envariance of
perfectly entangled ``Bell-like'' states can be used to rigorously justify
complete ignorance of the observer about the outcome of any measurement on
either of the members of the entangled pair. For more general states,
envariance leads to Born's rule, $p_k \propto |\psi_k|^2$ for the outcomes
associated with Schmidt states. Probabilities derived in this manner are an
objective reflection of the underlying state of the system -- they represent
experimentally verifiable symmetries, and not just a subjective ``state of
knowledge'' of the observer. Envariance - based approach is compared with and
found superior to pre-quantum definitions of probability including the {\it
standard definition} based on the `principle of indifference' due to Laplace,
and the {\it relative frequency approach} advocated by von Mises. Implications
of envariance for the interpretation of quantum theory go beyond the derivation
of Born's rule: Envariance is enough to establish dynamical independence of
preferred branches of the evolving state vector of the composite system, and,
thus, to arrive at the {\it environment - induced superselection (einselection)
of pointer states}, that was usually derived by an appeal to decoherence.
Envariant origin of Born's rule for probabilities sheds a new light on the
relation between ignorance (and hence, information) and the nature of quantum
states.

entanglement--the non-factorization of wave functions--reflects quantum
correlations. Singularity does, however, accompany the critical line, as
revealed by the divergence of the field-derivative of the entanglement along
the line. The form of this singularity is dictated by the universality class
controlling the quantum phase transition.
