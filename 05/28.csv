simultaneous deblurring of multiple noisy images via Tikhonov regularization.
We approach the problem in three ways. We first reduce the problem to a
single-image deblurring for which the regularization parameter can be estimated
through a classic generalized cross-validation (GCV) method. A modification of
this function is used for correcting the undersmoothing typical of the original
technique. With a second method, we minimize an average least-squares fit to
the images and define a new GCV function. In the last approach, we use the
classical $GCV$ on a single higher-dimensional image obtained by concatanating
all the images into a single vector. With a reliable estimator of the
regularization parameter, one can fully exploit the excellent computational
characteristics typical of direct deblurring methods, which, especially for
large images, makes them competitive with the more flexible but much slower
iterative algorithms. The performance of the techniques is analyzed through
numerical experiments. We find that under the independent homoscedastic and
Gaussian assumptions made on the noise, the three approaches provide almost
identical results with the first single image providing the practical advantage
that no new software is required and the same image can be used with other
deblurring algorithms.

distributions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays above 10^19 eV from individual
sources on their magnetization. We find that, especially for sources within a
few megaparsecs from the observer, observable spectra and composition are
severely modified if the source is surrounded by fields of ~ 10^-7 Gauss on
scales of a few megaparsecs. Low energy particles diffuse over larger distances
during their energy loss time. This leads to considerable hardening of the
spectrum up to the energy where the loss distance becomes comparable to the
source distance. Magnetized sources thus have very important consequences for
observations, even if cosmic rays arrive within a few degrees from the source
direction. At the same time, details in spectra and chemical composition may be
intrinsically unpredictable because they depend on the unknown magnetic field
structure. If primaries are predominantly nuclei of atomic mass A accelerated
up to a maximum energy E_max with spectra not much softer than E^-2, secondary
protons from photo-disintegration can produce a conspicuous peak in the
spectrum at energy ~ E_max/A. A related feature appears in the average mass
dependence on energy.

we exploit angular power spectra of EPS, $P(k)$, estimated either by data
coming from currently available surveys or by means of theoretical predictions.
By adopting the source number counts predicted by the Toffolatti et al. (1998)
evolution model -- capable of accounting well for the available data at radio
cm wavelengths -- we are able to reproduce current data on the two--point
angular correlation functions, $w(\theta)$, of radio sources. We can confirm
that the detection of primordial CMB anisotropies is not hampered by undetected
clustered sources at frequencies $\leq 150-200$ GHz. On the other hand, our
current findings show that at higher frequencies the clustering signal could
severely reduce the detectability of intrinsic CMB anisotropies, thus
confirming previous theoretical predictions. We also show that unsubtracted EPS
can account for the excess signal at high multipoles detected by recent CMB
anisotropy experiments. Moreover, the additional power due to the clustering of
sources gives rise to a small but not negligible contribution to the same
excess signal. As a final result, we also present an example of a currently
feasible {\it realistic map} of EPS at 70 GHz, by taking into account data on
bright detected sources as well as the previously quoted model for number
counts.

observed in typical mature elliptical galaxies LX ~10^(41-42) erg s^-1), into
which these merger remnants are expected to evolve. We do not see evidence that
the X-ray halos of these galaxies are currently being regenerated to the masses
and luminosities seen in typical elliptical galaxies. The mass of atomic gas
available to fall back into the main bodies of these galaxies and shock-heat to
X-ray temperatures is insufficient for this to be the sole halo regeneration
mechanism. We conclude that halo regeneration is most likely a long-term (>10
Gyr) process, occurring predominantly via mass loss from evolving stars, in a
sub-sonic outflow stage commencing ~2 Gyr after the merging event.

preferentially in cluster infalling regions (at about the virial radius, or at
a local galaxy density of $\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-2}$). The discovery directly connects
the passive spiral galaxies to the cluster galaxy evolution studies such as the
Butcher-Oemler effect or the morphology-density relation, i.e., passive spiral
galaxies are likely to be transition objects between high-z blue, spiral
galaxies and low-z red, cluster early-type galaxies. Thus, detailed study of
passive spiral galaxies potentially could bring a new insight on the underlying
physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution. However, in previous
work, passive spiral galaxies are selected from the low resolution optical
images with $\sim 1.5$ arcsec of seeing. Therefore, passive spirals could be a
mis-identification of S0 galaxies; or dusty-starburst galaxies which are not
passive at all. To answer these questions, we performed a deep,
high-resolution, near-infrared imaging of 32 passive spiral galaxies. Our high
resolution $K$ band images show clear spiral arm structures. Thus, passive
spirals are not S0s. Optical-infrared colour does not show any signs of
dusty-starburst at all. Therefore, it is likely that they are truly ``passive''

reactions inside stars: -- the process of nucleosynthesis. The basic concepts
of determining nuclear reaction rates inside stars and how they manage to burn
their fuel so slowly most of the time are discussed. Thermonuclear reactions
involving protons in the hydrostatic burning of hydrogen in stars are discussed
first. This is followed by triple alpha reactions in the helium burning stage
and the issues of survival of carbon and oxygen in red giant stars connected
with nuclear structure of oxygen and neon. Advanced stages of nuclear burning
in quiescent reactions involving carbon, neon, oxygen and silicon are
discussed. The role of neutron induced reactions in nucleosynthesis beyond iron
is discussed briefly, as also the experimental detection of neutrinos from SN
1987A which confirmed broadly the ideas concerning gravitational collapse
leading to a supernova.

limits on the column density of the species to be determined. For OVII a column
density of 10^18.36-10^18.86 cm^-2 is found. This column density of OVII, when
combined with the inferred FeI absorption, is sufficient to explain the drop in
flux at 0.7 keV as being due to absorption from the warm absorber. Fitting OI

obtain flat, slightly rising, and even declining rotation curves. The model
self-evidently explains the reason why most of the spirals show almost flat or
slightly rising rotation curves and very few show declining curves. The NZRPs
follow trajectories, and are finally trapped in circles of minimum radii $\sim

soft X-rays and a single-peaked pulsation in harder X-rays. From XMM-Newton
observations we find that the soft band is dominated by blackbody emission from
the heated white-dwarf surface. Such emission is at a maximum when either
magnetic pole points towards us, explaining the double-peaked pulsation. The
symmetry of the pulses requires that the angle between the magnetic and spin
axes be high.
  The single-peaked pulsation in harder X-rays is explained in the usual way,
as a result of opacity in the accretion curtains. However, the high dipole
inclination means that the accretion curtains are nearly in the plane. Thus the
outer regions of the curtains do not cross the line of sight to the accretion
footprints, explaining the absence of the deep absorption dip characteristic of
many intermediate polars. The sawtooth profile of this pulsation requires that
the magnetic axis be offset from the white-dwarf centre.
  We remark also on the double-peaked optical emission in this star. We suggest
that the difference between V405 Aur's spin pulse and those of other
intermediate polars is the result of its high dipole inclination.

temperature power spectrum with error bars analytically derived from the
cross-correlation matrix.
  This method presents three main useful properties : (1) no estimation of the
noise power spectrum is needed, (2) complex weighting schemes including sky
covering and map noise properties can be easily taken into account, and
corrected for, for each input map, (3) error bars are quickly computed

different sky surveys such as CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect or mass

February, 23--25 we triggered a Target of Opportunity (ToO) program using the

Southern Observatory (La Silla) to get optical and near-infrared (NIR)
observations. We discovered the optical counterpart, and confirmed the already
proposed candidate in the NIR. We report here photometric measurements in the
R, I and J bands, upper flux limits in the Bb and V bands, lower flux limits in
the H and Ks bands. We also got NIR spectroscopy between 0.95 and 2.52 microns,
revealing a large amount of emission lines, including forbidden iron lines and
P-Cygni profiles, and showing a strong similarity with CI Cam, another strongly
absorbed source. Together with the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), these
data point to a high luminosity, high temperature source, with an intrinsic
absorption greater than the interstellar absorption, but two orders of
magnitude below the X-ray absorption. We propose the following picture to match
the data: the source is a High Mass X-ray binary (HMXB) at a distance between
0.9 and 6.2 kpc, the optical/NIR counterpart corresponds to the mass donor,
which is an early-type star, probably a sgB[e] star, surrounded by a dense and
absorbing circumstellar material. This would make the second HMXB with a sgB[e]
star as the mass donor after CI Cam. Such sources may represent a different
evolutionary state of X-ray binaries previously undetected with the lower
energy space telescopes; if it is so, a new class of strongly absorbed X-ray
binaries is being unveiled by INTEGRAL.

previously obtained from EUVE spectra during quiescent and flaring states,
confirming the long-term stability of the corona of AD Leo. At variance with
the case of other active stars, the EMD of AD Leo is characterized by a
significantly shallower slope, compatible with that predicted by static models
of isobaric loops with constant cross-section and uniform heating. We discuss
such coronal modeling to infer the average properties of the corona in terms of
loop populations, including estimates of the surface filling factor. We also
show that the EMD is compatible with the model of a corona continuously heated

have described the MCMC analysis method specifically in terms of SZ but hope
the description will be of more general use. We find that the effects of
primordial CMB contamination tend to be similar in the estimates of both the
gas mass and total mass over our narrow range of angular scales, so that there
is little effect of primordials on the gas fraction determination. Using our

is 0.7, where the fixed substrate has the structure of a (001) plane of a

various forms of density-reducing packing frustration next to the
incommensurate substrate, including some cases displaying disorder that extends
far from the substrate. The disk system calculations strongly suggest that the
most efficient (highest density) packings involve configurations that are
periodic in the lateral direction parallel to the substrate, with substantial
geometric disruption only occurring near the substrate. Some evidence has also
emerged suggesting that for the sphere systems a corresponding structure doubly
periodic in the lateral directions would yield the highest packing density;
however all of the sphere simulations completed thus far produced some residual
""bulk"" disorder not obviously resulting from substrate mismatch. In view of the
fact that the cases studied here represent only a small subset of all that

compared with those of an effective 1D model, the nonpolynomial Schrodinger

instability thresholds are shown to be scarcely affected by transverse
excitations, so that they can be accurately predicted by effective 1D models.
Conversely, transverse excitations turn out to be important in characterizing
the stability diagram and the occurrence of a complex radial dynamics above the

shows that it is not restricted to fluids composed of particles interacting
solely via pair potentials; rather it applies to general, multi-body

equation and the theory is therefore one for Brownian particles and as such is
applicable to colloidal fluids. In the second part of this paper we use the
dynamical density functional theory to derive a theory for spinodal
decomposition that is applicable at both early and intermediate times. For
early stages of spinodal decomposition our non-linear theory is equivalent to
the (generalised) linear Cahn-Hilliard theory, but for later times it
incorporates coupling between different Fourier components of the density
fluctuations (modes) and therefore goes beyond Cahn-Hilliard theory. We
describe the results of calculations for a model (Yukawa) fluid which show that
the coupling leads to the growth of a second maximum in the density
fluctuations, at a wavenumber larger than that of the main peak.

example, a visualization is rendered or an inference is made about the
potential actions that might be consistent with a user's state. Drawing on
observational research on the use of existing communication technology, we
argue (as have others in the past) that determination of availability is often
a joint process, and often one that takes the form of a negotiation (whether
implicit or explicit). We briefly describe our current research on applying
machine learning to infer degrees of conversational engagement from observed
conversational behavior. Such inferences can be applied to facilitate the
implicit negotiation of conversational engagement - in effect, helping users to
weave together the act of contact with the act of determining availability.

gravitational radiation that can be observed with a world-wide network of

restrict considerably the allowed simultaneity conventions. In particular, we
focus our study on the simplest among the allowed conventions. It should be
preferred over Einstein's in flat spacetime and in general if the tidal force

shadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable
rapidities, $y_cm = 1-2$. To study the formation of this effect initial stages
of relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied. An effective string rope
model is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes
into account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the
acceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength
(string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk
about ""string ropes"". The results show that QGP forms a tilted disk, such that
the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in the reaction plane, but
deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse flow directions. The
produced initial state can be used as an initial condition for further
hydrodynamical calculations. Such initial conditions lead to the creation of
third flow component. Recent $v_1$ measurements are promising that this effect
can be used as a diagnostic tool of the QGP.

soliton solutions with point-like symmetries and $B=3 \sim 5$ axially symmetric
saddle-point solutions, using rational map ansatz constructed for multi-baryon
number skyrmions. An interesting property of the solutions is that the symmetry
of the background configuration is reflected in the degeneracy of the valence
quark spectra. We also confirm the existence of the quark shell structure. The
shells consist of the four-fold degenerate ground state and higher levels with
various patterns, which are realized by the interplay of two symmetries,

the region of small radius in a dual zero-brane picture using Tseytlin's
proposal for a non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action for N D0-branes. A standard
large N approximation of the D0-brane action, familiar from the brane
dielectric effect, gives a time evolution which agrees with the Abelian
D2-brane Born-Infeld equations which describe a D2-brane collapsing to zero
size. The first 1/N correction from the symmetrised trace prescription in the
zero-brane action leads to a class of classical solutions where the minimum
radius of a collapsing D2-brane is lifted away from zero. We discuss the
validity of this approximation to the zero-brane action in the region of the
minimum, and explore higher order 1/N corrections as well as an exact finite N
example. The 1/N corrected Lagrangians and the finite N example have an
effective mass squared which becomes negative in some regions of phase space.
We discuss the physics of this tachyonic behaviour.

for arbitrary odd dimensions. The boundary term needed to render the action
finite is singled out demanding the action to attain an extremum for an
appropriate set of boundary conditions. The boundary term is a local function
of the fields at the boundary and is sufficient to render the action finite for
asymptotically AdS solutions, without requiring background fields. It is shown
that the Euclidean continuation of the action correctly describes the black

and/or nonzero density. For this purpose, we distinguish irrelevant from
relevant quark modes, as well as hard from soft gluon modes by introducing two
separate cut-offs in momentum space, one for quarks, $\Lambda_q$, and one for
gluons, $\Lambda_g$. We exactly integrate out irrelevant quark modes and hard
gluon modes in the functional integral representation of the QCD partition
function. Depending on the specific choice for $\Lambda_q$ and $\Lambda_g$, the
resulting effective action contains well-known effective actions for hot and/or
dense quark matter, for instance the ``Hard Thermal Loop'' or the ``Hard Dense
Loop'' action, as well as the high-density effective theory proposed by Hong
and others. We then apply our effective action to review the calculation of the
color-superconducting gap parameter to subleading order in weak coupling, where
the strong coupling constant $g \ll 1$. In this situation, relevant quark modes
are those within a layer of thickness $2 \Lambda_q$ around the Fermi surface.
The non-perturbative nature of the gap equation invalidates naive attempts to
estimate the importance of the various contributions via power counting on the
level of the effective action. Nevertheless, once the gap equation has been
derived within a particular many-body approximation scheme, the cut-offs
$\Lambda_q, \Lambda_g$ provide the means to rigorously power count different
contributions to the gap equation. We recover the previous result for the QCD
gap parameter for the choice $\Lambda_q \alt g \mu \ll \Lambda_g \alt \mu$,
where $\mu$ is the quark chemical potential. We also point out how to improve
this result beyond subleading order in weak coupling.

09, 1997. The monitoring was done with one the analogical station (used for
magnitude duration measurement and statistical control activity) and seven
digital stations. The digital stations, with three components each, were
operated from June to November 1997. In this work, the data collected during
digital monitoring was analyzed to determine hypocenters and focal mechanism.
To determine hypocenters, the HYPO71 program was used, with half-space model,
whose parameters were 5.95 km/s, for P-wave velocities, and 1.69 for the ratio
between P and S-wave velocity. The active zone was nearly 1 km length, with
depth between 4.5 and 5.2 km. With 16 events recorded in the same six stations,
we determined the direction of the fault plane (NE-SW). The fault mechanism is
strike-slip with a small normal component. The dip estimate was 65$^{\circ}$SE
with FPFIT and 80$^{\circ}$SE with FOCMEC. Preliminary estimates of maximum
horizontal compressive stress, using P-axis direction, were in accordance with
Ferreira {\it et al.}(1998). The small difference is probably due to influence
of the sedimentary basin in the regional stress. The active area is in
accordance with seismicity described by Assump\c{c}\~ao (1998), i. e., the
combination regional stress, local flexural effect from thick sedimentary
loads, and a presumably weaker crust from Mesozoic thinning.

  Pub. NY 2005",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The galactic `dark matter' effect is regarded as one of the major problems in
fundamental physics. Here it is explained as a self-interaction dynamical
effect of space itself, and so is not caused by an unknown form of matter.
Because it was based on Kepler's Laws for the motion of the planets in the
solar system the Newtonian theory of gravity was too restricted. A
reformulation and generalisation of the Newtonian theory of gravity in terms of
a velocity in-flow field, representing at a classical level the relative motion
of a quantum-foam substructure to space, reveals a key dynamical feature of the
phenomenon of gravity, namely the so called `dark matter' effect, which
manifests not only in spiral galaxy rotation curves, but also in the borehole g
anomaly, globular and galactic black holes, and in ongoing problems in
improving the accuracy with which Newton's gravitational constant G is
measured. The new theory of gravity involves an additional new dimensionless
gravitational constant, and experimental data reveals this to be the fine
structure constant. The new theory correctly predicts the globular cluster
black hole masses, and that the `frame-dragging' effect is caused by vorticity
in the in-flow. The relationship of the new theory of gravity to General
Relativity which, like Newtonian gravity, does not have the `dark matter'
dynamics, is explained.

a dense bunch of relativistic electrons is produced. These accelerated
electrons make betatron oscillations in the transverse fields of the bubble and
emit a bright broadband X-ray radiation with a maximum about 50 keV. The
emission is confined to a small angle of about 0.1 rad. In addition, we make
simulations of X-ray generation by an external 28.5-GeV electron bunch injected
into the bubble. $\gamma$-quanta with up to GeV energies are observed in the

is efficient, leading to a significant stopping of the electron bunch over 5 mm

investigated under the influence of real conditions including the dynamic
polarizability of the atom, finite conductivity of the wall metal and nonzero
temperature of the system. Both analytical and numerical results for the free
energy and force are obtained over a wide range of the atom-wall distances.
Numerical computations are performed for an Au wall and metastable
He${}^{\ast}$, Na and Cs atoms. For the He${}^{\ast}$ atom we demonstrate, as
an illustration, that at short separations of about the Au plasma wavelength at
room temperature the free energy deviates up to 35% and the force up to 57%
from the classical Casimir-Polder result. Accordingly, such large deviations
should be taken into account in precision experiments on atom-wall
interactions. The combined account of different corrections to the
Casimir-Polder interaction leads to the conclusion that at short separations
the corrections due to the dynamic polarizability of an atom play a more
important role than -- and suppress -- the corrections due to the nonideality
of the metal wall. By the comparison of the exact atomic polarizabilities with
those in the framework of the single oscillator model, it is shown that the
obtained asymptotic expressions enable calculation of the free energy and force
for the atom-wall interaction under real conditions with a precision of one
percent.

mode of operation. The approach of a first principle quantum heat engine toward
this stable limit cycle is studied. The engine is based on a working medium
consisting of an ensemble of quantum systems composed of two coupled spins. A
four stroke cycle of operation is studied, with two {\em isochore} branches
where heat is transferred from the hot/cold baths and two {\em adiabats} where
work is exchanged. The dynamics is generated by a completely positive map. It
has been shown that the performance of this model resembles an engine with
intrinsic friction. The quantum conditional entropy is employed to prove the
monotonic approach to a limit cycle. Other convex measures, such as the quantum
distance display the same monotonic approach. The equations of motion of the
engine are solved for the different branches and are combined to a global
propagator that relates the state of the engine in the beginning of the cycle
to the state after one period of operation of the cycle. The eigenvalues of the
propagator define the rate of relaxation toward the limit cycle. A longitudinal
and transverse mode of approach to the limit cycle is identified. The entropy
balance is used to explore the necessary conditions which lead to a stable
limit cycle. The phenomena of friction can be identified with a zero change in
the von Neumann entropy of the working medium.

N-spin system with N>>1. Here, a quantum state is said to be macroscopically
entangled if it is a superposition of macroscopically distinct states. To judge
whether such superposition is hidden in a general state, we use an essentially
unique index p: A pure state is macroscopically entangled if p=2, whereas it
may be entangled but not macroscopically if p<2. This index is directly related
to the stability of the state. We calculate the index p for various states in
which magnons are excited with various densities and wavenumbers. We find
macroscopically entangled states (p=2) as well as states with p=1. The former
states are unstable in the sense that they are unstable against some local
measurements. On the other hand, the latter states are stable in the senses
that they are stable against local measurements and that their decoherence
rates never exceed O(N) in any weak classical noises. For comparison, we also
calculate the von Neumann entropy S(N) of a subsystem composed of N/2 spins as
a measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that S(N) of some states with p=1
is of the same order of magnitude as the maximum value N/2. On the other hand,
S(N) of the macroscopically entangled states with p=2 is as small as O(log N)<<
N/2. Therefore, larger S(N) does not mean more instability. We also point out
that these results are analogous to those for interacting many bosons.
Furthermore, the origin of the huge entanglement, as measured either by p or
S(N), is discussed to be due to the spatial propagation of magnons.

theorem asserts that any quantum cellular automaton is structurally reversible,
