explaining salient features observed, is proposed. The only requirement is that
a significant relativistic component, in the form of cosmic rays (CR), be
present in the intra-cluster medium and significantly frozen to the thermal
gas. Such an addition qualitatively alters the conventional isobaric thermal
instability criterion such that a fluid parcel becomes thermally stable when
its thermal pressure drops below a threshold fraction of its CR pressure.
Consequently, the lowest possible temperature at any radius is about one third
of the ambient temperature {\it at that radius}, exactly as observed, In
addition, we suggest that dissipation of internal gravity waves, excited by
radial oscillatory motions of inward drifting cooling clouds about their radial
equilibrium positions, may be responsible for heating up cooling gas. With the
ultimate energy source for powering the cooling X-ray luminosity and heating up
cooling gas being gravitational due to inward drifting cooling clouds as well
as the general inward flow, heating is spatially distributed and energetically
matched with cooling. One desirable property of this heating mechanism is that
heating energy is strongly centrally concentrated, providing the required
heating for emission-line nebulae.

long baselines of 30m, 37m, and 64m, on 19 spectral channels, covering the
wavelength range of 520nm to 850nm. The outstanding characteristics of these
observations are (a) high resolution with the minimum fringe spacing of 1.7mas,
easily resolving the 3-milliarcsecond (mas) stellar disk, and (b) the
measurement of closure phase which is a sensitive indicator to the asymmetry of
the brightness distribution of the source. Uniform disk diameters fit to the
measured squared visibility amplitudes confirms the Altair's oblate shape due
to its rapid rotation. The measured observables of Altair showed two features
which are inconsistent with both the uniform-disk and limb-darkened disk
models, while the measured observable of the comparison star, Vega, are
consistent with the limb-darkened disk model. The first feature is that
measured squared visibility amplitudes at the first minimum do not reach 0.0
but rather remain at about 0.02, indicating the existence of a small bright
region on the stellar disk. The other is that the measured closure phases show
non-zero/180 degrees at all spectral channels, which requires an asymmetric
surface brightness distribution. We fitted the measured observables to a model
with a bright spot on a limb-darkened disk and found the observations are well
reproduced by a bright spot, which has relative intensity of 4.7%, on a 3.38
mas limb-darkened stellar disk. Rapid rotation of Altair indicates that this
bright region is a pole, which is brighter than other part of the star owing to
gravity darkening.

The exotic SC in a homogeneous CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ revealed antiferromagnetic
critical fluctuations at the border to antiferromagnetism (AFM) or marginal
AFM. The uniform mixed phase of SC and AFM in CeCu$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$
emerges on a microscopic level, once a tiny amount of 1%Ge($x=0.01$) is
substituted for Si to expand its lattice. The application of minute pressure
($P\sim 0.19$ GPa) suppresses the sudden emergence of the AFM caused by doping
Ge. The persistence of the low-lying magnetic excitations at temperatures lower
than $T_c$ and $T_N$ is ascribed due to the uniform mixed phase of SC and AFM.
Likewise, the $P$-induced HF superconductor CeRhIn$_5$ coexists with AFM on a
microscopic level in $P = 1.5$ - 1.9 GPa. The unconventional gapless nature of
SC in the low-lying excitation spectrum emerges due to the uniform mixed phase

excitations such as spin-density fluctuations induced by the first-order phase
transition from the AFM to the paramagnetism (PM) might mediate attractive
interaction to form the Cooper pairs in the novel phase of AFM.

quantum mechanics to the low energy effective degrees of freedom of a more
fundamental theory defined at ultra-high-energy/short-wavelength scales. We
shall argue here that, even for free quantum fields, there are holistic aspects
of quantum field theory that cannot be properly understood in this manner.
Specifically, the ``subtractions'' needed to define nonlinear polynomial
functions of a free quantum field in curved spacetime are quite simple and
natural from the quantum field theoretic point of view, but are at best
extremely ad hoc and unnatural if viewed as independent renormalizations of
individual modes of the field. We illustrate this point by contrasting the
analysis of the Casimir effect, the renormalization of the stress-energy tensor
in time-dependent spacetimes, and anomalies from the point of quantum field
theory and from the point of view of quantum mechanics applied to the
independent low energy modes of the field. Some implications for the
cosmological constant problem are discussed.

compared with the pure Wilson (fundamental) gauge action at the same lattice

Landau-Ginzburg formulation, we propose a closed formula for the effective
deformation potential, defined as the generating function of tree-level open
string amplitudes in the presence of D-branes. This provides a direct link to
the categorical description, and can be formulated in terms of holomorphic
matrix models. We also check that the critical locus of this potential

Using these tools, we perform a detailed analysis of a few examples, for which
we obtain a complete algebro-geometric description of moduli spaces and strata.

selfsimilar fractal fluctuations and the corresponding power spectra follow
inverse power law form, which implies the following: (1) A scale invariant eddy
continuum, namely, the amplitudes of component eddies are related to each other
by a scale factor alone. In general, the scale factor is different for
different scale ranges and indicates a multifractal structure for the spatial
distribution of DNA base sequence. (2) Long-range spatial correlations of the
eddy fluctuations. Multifractal structure to space-time fluctuations and the
associated inverse power law form for power spectra is generic to spatially
extended dynamical systems in nature and is a signature of self-organized
criticality. The exact physical mechanism for the observed self-organized
criticality is not yet identified. The author has developed a general systems
theory where quantum mechanical laws emerge as self-consistent explanations for
the observed long-range space-time correlations, i.e. the apparently chaotic
fractal fluctuations are signatures of quantum-like chaos in dynamical systems.
The model provides unique quantification for the observed inverse power law
form for power spectra in terms of the statistical normal distribution. In this
paper it is shown that the frequency distribution of the bases C+G in all
available contiguous sequences for Human chromosome Y DNA exhibit model
predicted quantum-like chaos.
