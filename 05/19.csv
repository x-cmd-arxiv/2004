relativistic black hole accretion disk in the presence of a spiral motion in
Kerr geometry, the work extended from an earlier literature motivated by recent
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The velocity field of the spiral motion,
superposed on the background Keplerian flow, results in a complicated redshift
distribution in the accretion disk. An X-ray source attributed to a localized
flaring region on the black hole symmetry axis illuminates the iron in the
disk. The emissivity form becomes very steep because of the light bending
effect from the primary X-ray source to the disk. The predicted line profile is
calculated for various spiral waves, and we found, regardless of the source
height, that: (i) a multiple-peak along with a classical double-peak structure
generally appears, (ii) such a multiple-peak can be categorized into two types,
sharp sub-peaks and periodic spiky peaks, (iii) a tightly-packed spiral wave
tends to produce more spiky multiple peaks, whereas (iv) a spiral wave with a
larger amplitude seems to generate more sharp sub-peaks, (v) the effect seems
to be less significant when the spiral wave is centrally concentrated, (vi) the
line shape may show a drastic change (forming a double-peak, triple-peak or
multiple-peak feature) as the spiral wave rotates with the disk. Our results
emphasize that around a rapidly-rotating black hole an extremely redshifted
iron line profile with a noticeable spike-like feature can be realized in the
presence of the spiral wave. Future X-ray observations, from {\it Astro-E2} for
example, will have sufficient spectral resolution for testing our spiral wave
model which exhibits unique spike-like features.

We consider possible origins of the absorption, including the interstellar
medium (ISM) of NGC 4395, the narrow-line region (NLR), outflowing UV
absorbers, and X-ray ``warm absorbers.'' Component 1, at a radial velocity of
-770 km/sec with respect to the nucleus, is only identified in the C IV 1548.2

seen in a majority of Seyfert 1 galaxies, although additional observations are
needed to confirm the reality of this feature. Component 2, at -114 km/sec,
most likely arises in the ISM of NGC 4395; its ionic column densities cannot be
matched by photoionization models with a power-law continuum. Our models of the
highly ionized X-ray absorbers claimed for this active galactic nucleus
indicate that they would have undetectable C IV absorption, but large O VI and

of the models to produce the required degree of reionization. We also consider
possible constraints associated with the observations of the two extremely
metal-poor stars HE 0107-5240 and CS22949-037. We confirm that an early
top-heavy stellar component is required, as a standard star formation model is
unable to reionize the early Universe and reproduce the abundances of the very
metal-poor halo stars. A bimodal (or top-heavy) IMF (40 - 100 M_\odot) is our
preferred scenario compared to the extreme mass range (\ga 100 M_\odot) often
assumed to be responsible for the early stages of reionization. A mode of even
more extreme stellar masses in the range (\ge 270 M_\odot) has also been
considered. All massive stars in this mode collapse entirely into black holes,
and as a consequence, chemical evolution and reionization are de-correlated.

to study the mass and the mass distribution of galaxy clusters. However, weak
lensing mass reconstructions are plagued by the so-called mass-sheet
degeneracy--the surface mass density \kappa of the cluster can be determined
only up to a degeneracy transformation \kappa \to \kappa' = \lambda \kappa + (1
-\lambda), where \lambda is an arbitrary constant. This transformation
fundamentally limits the accuracy of cluster mass determinations if no further
assumptions are made. We describe here a method to break the mass-sheet
degeneracy in weak lensing mass maps using distortion and redshift information
of background galaxies and illustrate this by two simple toy models. Compared
to other techniques proposed in the past, it does not rely on any assumptions
on cluster potential; it can be easily applied to non-parametric
mass-reconstructions and no assumptions on boundary conditions have to be made.
In addition it does not make use of weakly constrained information (such as the
source number counts, used in the magnification effect). Our simulations show
that we are effectively able to break the mass-sheet degeneracy for
supercritical lenses, but that for undercritical lenses the mass-sheet
degeneracy is very difficult to be broken, even under idealised conditions.

underlying population of high-redshift, dust-enshrouded galaxies. From a

robust sub-sample of 13 SMGs detected by both MAMBO and SCUBA at a significance

amongst the 18 MAMBO sources which are not detected by SCUBA. While we cannot
rule out that some of them are SCUBA drop-outs at z >> 3, their overall

that of the 13 SMGS which were robustly identified by both MAMBO and SCUBA.

measure the temperature and gas density in the very central region of the

the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry, we obtain
the deprojected mass profiles of these clusters.
  The mass profiles are nicely scalable with a characteristic radius
($r_{200}$) and mass ($M_{200}$) on the large scale of $r>0.1r_{200}$. In
contrast, the central ($r<0.1r_{200}$) mass profiles have a large scatter even
after the scaling. The inner slope $\alpha$ of the total mass density profile
($\rho(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$) is derived from the slope of the integrated
mass profile. The values of the inner slope $\alpha$ at the radius of
$0.02r_{200}$ ($\alpha_0$) span a wide range from 0 to 1.2. For 6 out of 20
clusters, $\alpha_0$ is lower than unity at a 90 % confidence level. CDM
simulations predict that the inner slope $\alpha$ is in the range $1<\alpha<2$,

contribution. Separating the two components to measure the peculiar velocity of
galaxy clusters requires radio and microwave observations at three or more
frequencies, and knowledge of the temperature T_e of the intracluster medium
weighted by the electron number density. To quantify the systematics of this
procedure, we extract a sample of 117 massive clusters at redshift z=0 from an
N-body hydrodynamical simulation, with 2x480^3 particles, of a cosmological
volume 192 Mpc/h on a side of a flat Cold Dark Matter model with Omega_0=0.3
and Lambda=0.7. Our simulation includes radiative cooling, star formation and
the effect of feedback and galactic winds from supernovae. We find that (1) our
simulated clusters reproduce the observed scaling relations between X-ray and
SZ properties; (2) bulk flows internal to the intracluster medium affect the
velocity estimate by less than 200 km/s in 93 per cent of the cases; (3) using
the X-ray emission weighted temperature, as an estimate of T_e, can
overestimate the peculiar velocity by 20-50 per cent, if the microwave
observations do not spatially resolve the cluster. For spatially resolved
clusters, the assumptions on the spatial distribution of the ICM, required to
separate the two SZ components, still produce a velocity overestimate of 10-20
per cent, even with an unbiased measure of T_e. Thanks to the large size of our
cluster samples, these results set a robust lower limit of 200 km/s to the
systematic errors that will affect upcoming measures of cluster peculiar
velocities with the SZ effect.

d) the line profiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow P-Cygni
lines with the absorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with
BVZI ~4000 km/s; and (iii) broad, smooth wings, most apparent in H-alpha. These
components are identified with an expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope,
shocked cool gas in the forward post-shock region, and multiple Thomson
scattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P-Cygni lines
from the supernova is the result of the formation of an optically thick, cool,
dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. We model the
supernova deceleration and Thomson scattering wings to recover the density,
radial extent and Thomson optical depth of the CS envelope during the first
month. We reproduce the light curve with a hydrodynamical model and find it to
be powered by a combination of internal energy leakage after the explosion of
an extended pre-supernova (~10^15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellar
interaction. We recover the pre-explosion kinematics of the CS envelope: it is
close to homologous expansion with outer velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematic
age of ~1.5 yr. The CS envelope's high mass and kinetic energy, combined with
its small age, strongly suggest that the CS envelope was explosively ejected
about 1.5 yr before the supernova explosion.

test of it analyzing the, probably, simplest example of a non trivial system
undergoing a continuous phase transition: the completely connected version of
the spherical model. Going through the topological properties of its PES it is
shown that, as expected, the phase transition is correlated with a change in
their topology. Nevertheless this change, as reflected in the behavior of a
particular topological invariant, the Euler characteristic, is small at
variance with the strong singularity observed in other systems. Furthermore, it
is shown that in the presence of an external field, when the phase transition
is destroyed, a similar topology change in the sub-manifolds is still observed
at the maximum value of the potential energy manifold, a level which
nevertheless is thermodynamically inaccessible. This suggests that static
properties of the PES are not enough in order to decide whether a phase
transition will take place, some input from dynamics seems necessary.

an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator,and its spin-wave spectrum is

Heisenberg Hamiltonian with Ising anisotropy. Upon doping, as the e_g electron
concentration (1-x) decreases, both the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin
correlations in the paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ordered moment
decrease due to an increase of frustrating interactions, and Neel order
disappears above xc = 0.115(10). In the intermediate region, there exists
neither long-range magnetic nor superstructural order. Short-range-correlated

from charge and orbital ordering on the Mn sites. For x > 0.50, the

1/2 on a two-dimensional square lattice is studied in the auxiliary-fermion

requires a constraint on the fermion charge Q=1 on each lattice site, which is
imposed approximately through the thermal average. The resulting interacting
fermion system is first treated in mean-field theory (MFT), which yields an AF
ordered ground state and spin waves in quantitative agreement with conventional
spin-wave theory. At finite temperature a self-consistent approximation beyond
mean field is required in order to fulfill the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We first
discuss a fully self-consistent approximation, where fermions are renormalized
due to fluctuations of their spin density, in close analogy to FLEX. While
static properties like the correlation length come out correctly, the dynamical
response lacks the magnon-like peaks which would reflect the appearance of
short-range order at low T. This drawback, which is caused by overdamping, is
overcome in a `minimal self-consistent approximation' (MSCA), which we derive
from the equations of motion. The MSCA features dynamical scaling at small
energy and temperature and is qualitatively correct both in the regime of
order-parameter relaxation at long wavelengths and in the short-range-order
regime. We also discuss the impact of vertex corrections and the problem of
pseudo-gap formation in the single-particle density of states due to long-range
fluctuations. Finally we show that the (short-range) magnetic order in MFT and
MSCA helps to fulfill the constraint on the local fermion occupancy.

this effect in the dc response to the combined action of two driving ac-fields
(bichromatic irradiation). Compared to the case of monochromatic irradiation,
which is currently intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically,
the presence of a second microwave source provides additional insight into the
properties of an ac-driven 2D electron gas. In particular, we find that
nonparabolicity, being the simplest cause for a violation of Kohn's theorem,
gives rise to new qualitative effects specific to bichromatic irradiation.
Namely, when the frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are well away from the
cyclotron frequency, $\omega_c$, our simple classical considerations
demonstrate that the system becomes parametrically unstable with respect to
fluctuations with frequency $(\omega_1+\omega_2)/2$. As an additional effect of
nonparabolicity, this parametric instability can manifest itself in the dc
properties of the system. This happens when $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$ and
$\omega_c$ are related as 3:1:2, respectively. Even for weak detuning between
$\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, the effect of the bichromatic irradiation on the dc
response in the presence of nonparabolicity can differ dramatically from the
monochromatic case. In particular, the equations of motion can acquire
multistable solutions. As a result, the diagonal dc-conductivity can assume

the use of a mutation operator which performs local search in the sub-solution

proposes building and using an internal probabilistic model of the fitness

of some offspring are estimated using the probabilistic model, thereby avoiding
computationally expensive function evaluations. The scalability of the
aforementioned techniques are analyzed using facetwise models for convergence
time and population sizing. The speed-up obtained by each of the methods is
predicted and verified with empirical results. The results show that for

a class of deterministic and stochastic additively separable problems. This
study assumes that the recombination and mutation operators have the knowledge
of the building blocks (BBs) and effectively exchange or search among competing
BBs. Facetwise models of convergence time and population sizing have been used
to determine the scalability of each algorithm. The analysis shows that for
additively separable deterministic problems, the BB-wise mutation is more
efficient than crossover, while the crossover outperforms the mutation on
additively separable problems perturbed with additive Gaussian noise. The
results show that the speed-up of using BB-wise mutation on deterministic
problems is O(k^{0.5}logm), where k is the BB size, and m is the number of BBs.
Likewise, the speed-up of using crossover on stochastic problems with fixed
noise variance is O(mk^{0.5}log m).

adapts linkage and solves hard problems quickly, reliably, and accurately. A
probabilistic model building process is used to automatically identify key

probabilistic model of linkage groups to find the best among competing building
blocks. The competent selectomutative GA successfully solves additively
separable problems of bounded difficulty, requiring only subquadratic number of
function evaluations. The results show that for additively separable problems
the probabilistic model building BB-wise mutation scales as O(2^km^{1.5}), and
requires O(k^{0.5}logm) less function evaluations than its selectorecombinative

inheritance on the convergence time and population sizing are modeled and the
speed-up obtained through inheritance is predicted. The results show that a
fitness-inheritance mechanism which utilizes information on building-block

based on the observer past null cone. A known difficulty in using inhomogeneous
models is that the null geodesic equation is not integrable in general. Our
choice of null coordinates solves the radial ingoing null geodesic by
construction. Furthermore, we use an approach where the velocity field is
uniquely calculated from the metric rather than put in by hand. Conveniently,
this allows us to explore models in a non-comoving frame of reference. In this
frame, we find that the velocity field has shear, acceleration and expansion
rate in general. We show that a comoving frame is not compatible with expanding
perfect fluid models in the coordinates proposed and dust models are simply not
possible. We describe the models in a non-comoving frame. We use the dust

this by fitting real analytic amplitudes to high energy measurements of the
gamma p total cross section, for sqrt(s) > 4 GeV. We subsequently require that
the asymptotic fit smoothly join the sqrt(s) = 2.01 GeV cross section described
by Dameshek and Gilman as a sum of Breit-Wigner resonances. The results
strongly favor the high energy ln^2(s) fit of the form sigma_{gamma p} = c_0 +

theory, where the existence of galaxies and atoms is promoted to a vacuum
selection criterion. Then, low energy SUSY becomes unnecessary, and
supersymmetry -- if present in the fundamental theory -- can be broken near the
unification scale. All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become
ultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the
supersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,
and account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework
removes all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and
sparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the
cosmological gravitino and moduli problems. High-scale SUSY breaking raises the
mass of the light Higgs to about 120-150 GeV. The gluino is strikingly long
lived, and a measurement of its lifetime can determine the ultraheavy scalar
mass scale. Measuring the four Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to the gauginos
and higgsinos precisely tests for high-scale SUSY. These ideas, if confirmed,
will demonstrate that supersymmetry is present but irrelevant for the hierarchy
problem -- just as it has been irrelevant for the cosmological constant problem
-- strongly suggesting the existence of a fine-tuning mechanism in nature.

"physics/0405091","Andrey Akhmeteli","Andrey Akhmeteli","Efficient Heating of Thin Cylindrical Targets by Broad Electromagnetic
  Beams I","17 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  In many high-profile applications, such as nuclear fusion and pumping of
active media of short-wavelength lasers, it is necessary to achieve high
specific input of power of an electromagnetic beam in a target. Diffraction
sets the lower limit to the transverse dimensions of electromagnetic beams and
represents a fundamental obstacle for electromagnetic heating of small or
inaccessible regions. It was found, however, that it is possible to achieve
efficient heating of cylindrical targets by electromagnetic beams with
transverse dimensions that are several orders of magnitude greater than those
of the cylinder. These counter-intuitive results have the following physical
mechanism: the absorption in the cylinder causes a deep fall in the field
distribution, and this fall causes diffractive diffusion of the field towards
the axis from a large volume of the beam. The heating efficiency was rigorously
calculated using the exact solution of the problem of diffraction on an
infinite homogeneous cylinder (J.R. Wait, 1955). Several non-resonant domains
of parameters were found that provide efficient absorption of the energy of a
broad beam in a thin conducting cylinder. The typical asymptotic efficiency for
very thin cylinders is (2-5)/L, where L=ln(w/d), where d is the diameter of the
cylinder and w is the width of the beam waist in the longitudinal geometry or
the wavelength in the transverse geometry. This efficiency is high even if the
beam is several orders of magnitude broader than the cylinder. The relevant
conditions are not too rigid and may be used to heat cylindrical targets to
high temperatures in a number of important applications. External magnetic
field may further relax the conditions of efficient heating.

conditions in the axial direction is studied within the approximation of
linearized ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The normal mode equations are
completely separable, so both the toroidal Fourier harmonic index n and the
poloidal index m are good quantum numbers. The full spectrum of eigenvalues for
m in the range 1 to m_max is analyzed quantitatively, using asymptotics for
large m, numerics for all m, and graphics for qualitative understanding. The
density of eigenvalues scales like the square of m_max for large m_max. Because
finite-m corrections scale inversely as the square of m_max, their inclusion is
essential in order to obtain the correct statistics for the distribution of
eigenvalues. Near the largest growth rate only a single radial eigenmode
contributes to the spectrum, so the eigenvalues there depend only on m and n,
as in a two-dimensional system. However, unlike the generic separable
two-dimensional system, the statistics of the ideal-MHD spectrum departs
somewhat from the Poisson distribution, even for arbitrarily large m_max. This
departure from Poissonian statistics may be understood qualitatively from the
nature of the distribution of rational numbers in the rotational transform
profile.

disadvantages: (i) The numerical codes for the calculation of spin-angular
coefficients are usually very time-consuming; (ii) f-shells are often omitted
from programs for matrix element calculation since the tables for their
coefficients of fractional parentage are very extensive. The authors suppose
that a series of difficulties persisting in the traditional approach to the
calculation of spin-angular parts of matrix elements could be avoided by using
this secondly quantized methodology, based on angular momentum theory, on the
concept of the irreducible tensorial sets, on a generalized graphical method,
on quasispin and on the reduced coefficients of fractional parentage.

  Series of Jerky Flow","42 pages, 6 figures, to appear in the International Journal of
  Mechanical Behavior",,,,"physics.data-an",,"  Stress time series from the PLC effect typically exhibit stick-slips of
upload and download type. These data contain strong short-term correlations of
a nonlinear type. We investigate whether there are also long term correlations,
i.e. the successive up-down patterns are generated by a deterministic
mechanism. A statistical test is conducted for the null hypothesis that the
sequence of the up-down patterns is totally random. The test is constructed by
means of surrogate data, suitably generated to represent the null hypothesis.
Linear and nonlinear estimates are used as test statistics, namely
autocorrelation, mutual information and Lyapunov exponents, which are found to
have proper performance for the test. The test is then applied to three stress
time series under different experimental conditions. Rejections are obtained
for one of them and not with all statistics. From the overall results we cannot
conclude that the underlying mechanism to the PLC effect has long memory.

pseudoknots according to the minimal genus of the surface on which the RNA
structure can be embedded. This classification provides a simple and natural
way to tackle the problem of RNA folding prediction in presence of pseudoknots.
Based on that approach, we describe a Monte Carlo algorithm for the prediction
of pseudoknots in an RNA molecule.
