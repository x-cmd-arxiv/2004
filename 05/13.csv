experiment designed to study the dark energy and alternative explanations of
the acceleration of the Universe's expansion by performing a series of
complementary systematics-controlled measurements. We describe a
self-consistent reference mission design for building a Type Ia supernova
Hubble diagram and for performing a wide-area weak gravitational lensing study.
A 2-m wide-field telescope feeds a focal plane consisting of a 0.7
square-degree imager tiled with equal areas of optical CCDs and near infrared
sensors, and a high-efficiency low-resolution integral field spectrograph. The
SNAP mission will obtain high-signal-to-noise calibrated light-curves and
spectra for several thousand supernovae at redshifts between z=0.1 and 1.7. A
wide-field survey covering one thousand square degrees resolves ~100 galaxies
per square arcminute. If we assume we live in a cosmological-constant-dominated
Universe, the matter density, dark energy density, and flatness of space can
all be measured with SNAP supernova and weak-lensing measurements to a
systematics-limited accuracy of 1%. For a flat universe, the
density-to-pressure ratio of dark energy can be similarly measured to 5% for
the present value w0 and ~0.1 for the time variation w'. The large survey area,
depth, spatial resolution, time-sampling, and nine-band optical to NIR
photometry will support additional independent and/or complementary dark-energy
measurement approaches as well as a broad range of auxiliary science programs.

medium; and use GRBs to study the early universe out to z>10. The mission is
being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three
instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15-150 keV) detector; a
narrow-field X-ray telescope; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope. Redshift
determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB
science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of ~1
mCrab (~2x10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 15-150 keV band), more than an
order of magnitude better than HEAO A-4. A flexible data and operations system
will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients,
with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system.

magnitude-limited redshift surveys. Since, according to the current scenario of
structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter halos,
we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group
finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a
tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and
velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn
is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is
repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the
final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio
assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity
function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of
completeness of true members and contamination by interlopers. Our group finder
is more successful than the conventional Friends-of-Friends group finder in
assigning galaxies in common dark matter halos to a single group. We apply our
group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and compare the
resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the
$\Lambda$CDM `concordance' cosmology we find a clear discrepancy between the
model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In
order to match the observational results we have to either increase the
mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher than
current observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma_8 \simeq 0.7$, compared
to the `concordance' value of 0.9.

are significantly softer than most canonical X-ray sources. They are likely to
include a range of physical systems; some may be common systems in unusual
states: neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes (BHs), or SNRs. Others may be
accreting BHs of intermediate mass. We have analyzed {\it Chandra} data from

a narrow Ly-alpha line is observed (FWHM=1140 km/s). The large CIV/Ly-alpha
ratio in the broad-line region (BLR) emission from this object can be matched
most closely by a BLR dominated by gas at very high densities (10^15 cm^-3),
which suppresses the Ly-alpha emission, and illuminated by an incident
power-law extending to ~200 micron, which yields increased emission from purely
collisionally excited coolant lines (such as CIV, NV and OVI) but not from
recombination lines like Ly-alpha. However, the strong CIII emission predicted
by this model is not observed, and the observed broad CIII] emission must come
from a lower-density BLR component and should be accompanied by broad Ly-alpha
emission which is not observed. The least unlikely explanation for this
spectrum seems to be that any intrinsic broad Ly-alpha emission is removed by
smooth NV absorption in the red wing of the Ly-alpha emission line and by
smooth Ly-alpha absorption in the blue wing of the Ly-alpha emission line. This
postulated smooth absorption would be in addition to the strong, associated,
narrow absorption seen in numerous ions. Smooth absorption in Ly-alpha, NV and
OVI but not in CIV would be unusual, but not impossible, although it is
suspicious that the postulated absorption must almost exactly cancel the
postulated intrinsic broad emission. We conclude that the spectrum of SDSS
J0952+0114 appears unique (among ~3600 SDSS spectra of quasars at z>2.12)
because of some_combination_ of unusual parameters, and we discuss possible

1665 MHz down to 1.1 mJy rms in 4.0 km/s channels. The detected and undetected
18 cm OH lines support a scenario of radiatively pumped stimulated absorption
and emission with pumping dominated by the intraladder 119 micron line of OH,
suggesting a column density N(OH) ~= 10^15 to 10^16 cm^-2. Combined with
simultaneous HI 21 cm observations and published CO data, we apply the OH
redshifts to measurements of cosmic evolution of the fine structure constant
alpha = e^2/(hbar c). We obtain highly significant (~25 sigma) velocity offsets
between the OH and HI lines and the OH and CO lines, but measurements of
alpha-independent systematics demonstrate that the observed velocity
differences are entirely attributable to physical velocity offsets between
species rather than a change in alpha. The OH alone, in which conjugate line
profiles guarantee that both lines originate in the same molecular gas,
provides a weak constraint of Delta alpha/alpha_o = (+0.51 +/- 1.26) x 10^-5 at
z=0.2467. Higher frequency OH line detections can provide a larger lever arm on
Delta alpha and can increase precision by an order of magnitude. The OH
molecule can thus provide precise measurements of the cosmic evolution of alpha
that include quantitative constraints on systematic errors. Application of this
technique is limited only by the detectability of |tau|~0.01 OH lines toward
radio continuum sources and may be possible to z~5.

appear due to different mechanisms of explosion which leads to the formation of
two types of compact stars or due to two different sets of parameters mastering
a particular kick mechanism. The low velocity maximum (at $\sim 100$ km
s$^{-1}$) is connected with hadronic star formation, whereas the second peak
corresponds to quark stars. In the model of delayed collapse of hadronic stars
to quark stars (Berezhiani et al. 2003\nocite{bbd2003}) quark deconfinement
leads to a second energy release, and to a second kick, in addition to the kick
imparted to the newly formed hadronic star during the supernova explosion. If
the electromagnetic rocket mechanism can give a significant contribution to
pulsar kicks, then the high velocity peak can be connected with the shorter
initial spin periods of quark stars with respect to hadronic stars. We discuss
{\it pro et contra} of these scenarios.

an orbital period of 3.39 days, but from the photometric follow-up of its
parent star HD330075 we can exclude the presence of a transit. The induced
radial-velocity variations exceed 100 m/s in semi-amplitude and are easily
detected by state-of-the-art spectro-velocimeters. Nevertheless, the faint
magnitude of the parent star (V = 9.36) benefits from the efficient instrument:
With HARPS less than 10 observing nights and 3 hours of total integration time
were needed to discover the planet and characterize its orbit. The orbital
parameters determined from the observations made during the first HARPS run in
July 2003 have been confirmed by 7 additional observations carried out in
February 2004. The bisector analysis and a photometric follow-up give no hint
for activity-induced radial-velocity variations, indicating that the velocity
curve is best explained by the presence of a low-mass companion to the star. In

magnetars can provide constrains on the progenitor stars of the compact
objects, and the runaway velocities can be used to constrain the energy in the
explosion of massive stars that leave neutron stars and black holes. The
observations show that the neutron star binaries LS 5039, LSI +61 303 and the
low-mass black hole in GRO J1655-40 formed in energetic supernova explosions,
whereas the black holes of larger masses (M > 10 Msolar) in Cygnus X-1 and GRS

formation in the parent clusters of the microquasar LSI +61 303 and magnetars

a constant speed parallel to a lower stationary wall, whose surface is
patterned with an array of stripes representing alternating regions of no-shear
and finite or no-slip. Velocity fields and effective slip lengths are computed
both from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solution of the Stokes
equation for flow configurations either parallel or perpendicular to the
stripes. Excellent agreement between the hydrodynamic and MD results is
obtained when the normalized width of the slip regions, $a/\sigma \gtrsim {\cal
O}(10)$, where $\sigma$ is the (fluid) molecular diameter characterizing the
Lennard-Jones interaction. In this regime, the effective slip length increases
monotonically with $a/\sigma$ to a saturation value. For $a/\sigma \lesssim
{\cal O}(10)$ and transverse flow configurations, the non-uniform interaction
potential at the lower wall constitutes a rough surface whose molecular scale
corrugations strongly reduce the effective slip length below the hydrodynamic
results. The translational symmetry for longitudinal flow eliminates the
influence of molecular scale roughness; however, the reduced molecular ordering
above the wetting regions of finite slip for small values of $a/\sigma$
increases the value of the effective slip length far above the hydrodynamic
predictions. The strong inverse correlation between the effective slip length
and the liquid structure factor representative of the first fluid layer near
the patterned wall illustrates the influence of molecular ordering effects on
slip in non-inertial flows.

interface acts as a diffusional barrier for high energy particles due to the
large difference in atomic masses. The heavier atoms are predominantly ejected

proceeds by continuous nucleation of the smallest islands in the proximity of
larger 2D islands (extended over several HUCs) and following coalescence with
them. Such a growth scenario is verified by kinetic Monte Carlo simulation
which uses a coarse-grained model based on a limited capacity of HUC and a
mechanism which increases nucleation probability in a neighbourhood of already
saturated HUCs (correlated nucleation). The model provides a good fit for
experimental dependences of the relative number of Ag-occupied HUCs and the
preference in occupation of faulted HUCs on temperature and amount of deposited

effective, solvent-induced force between two such solutes are investigated by
constant temperature and pressure Molecular Dynamics simulations of model
solutes carrying various charge patterns. The results for neutral solutes agree
well with earlier findings, and with predictions of simple macroscopic
considerations: substantial hydrophobic attraction may be traced back to strong
depletion (``drying'') of the solvent between the solutes. This hydrophobic
attraction is strongly reduced when the solutes are uniformly charged, and the
total force becomes repulsive at sufficiently high charge; there is a
significant asymmetry between anionic and cationic solute pairs, the latter
experiencing a lesser hydrophobic attraction. The situation becomes more
complex when the solutes carry discrete (rather than uniform) charge patterns.
Due to antagonistic effects of the resulting hydrophilic and hydrophobic
``patches'' on the solvent molecules, water is once more significantly depleted
around the solutes, and the effective interaction reverts to being mainly
attractive, despite the direct electrostatic repulsion between solutes.
Examination of a highly coarse-grained configurational probability density
shows that the relative orientation of the two solutes is very different in
explicit solvent, compared to the prediction of the crude implicit solvent
representation. The present study strongly suggests that a realistic modeling
of the charge distribution on the surface of globular proteins, as well as the
molecular treatment of water are essential prerequisites for any reliable study
of protein aggregation.

vibrations on dry DNA using photoinduced infrared absorption spectroscopy.
Laser photoexcited (PE) holes are found to have a room-temperature lifetime in
excess of 1 ms, clearly indicating the presence of localization. However, from
a quantitative model analysis of the frequency shifts of vibrational modes
caused by the PE holes, we find the holevibrational coupling constant to be
relatively small, 0.2. This interaction leads to a change in the conformational
energy of 0.015 eV, which is too small to cause selftrapping at room
temperature. We conclude that, at least in the dry (A) form, DNA is best
understood in terms of a double chain of coupled quantum dots arising from the
pseudo-random chain sequence of base pairs, in which Anderson localization
prevents the formation of a metallic state.

that high entropy for Planck remnants of black holes appearing in the

noted that the suggested paradigm is consistent with the Holographic Principle.

incorporates the Ciafaloni-Pomarol mechanism for the dynamical determination of
the \mu parameter of the MSSM. It is replaced by (\lambda S), where S is a
singlet field, and the axion becomes a heavy pseudoscalar, G, by adding a mass,
m_G, by hand. The explicit breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is assumed to
be sufficiently weak at the TeV scale that the only observable consequence is
the mass m_G. Three models for the explicit PQ breaking are given; but the
utility of this framework is that the predictions for all physics at the
electroweak scale are independent of the particular model for PQ breaking. Our
framework leads to a theory similar to the MSSM, except that \mu is predicted
by the Ciafaloni-Pomarol relation, and there are light, weakly-coupled states
in the spectrum. The production and cascade decay of superpartners at colliders
occurs as in the MSSM, except that there is one extra stage of the cascade
chain, with the next-to-LSP decaying to its ""superpartner"" and \tilde{s},
dramatically altering the collider signatures for supersymmetry. The framework
is compatible with terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations for a
wide range of m_G and <s>. If G is as light as possible, 300 keV < m_G < 3 MeV,
it can have interesting effects on the radiation energy density during the
cosmological eras of nucleosynthesis and acoustic oscillation, leading to
predictions for N_{\nu BBN} and N_{\nu CMB} different from 3.

unique. We baseline the discussion of the parameter spaces allowed in VCMSSMs

beta with no relation between A_0 and B_0 assumed {\it a priori}, displaying
contours of B_0 for a fixed input value of A_0, incorporating the latest CDF/D0

that phenomenological studies of the CMSSM are frequently not applicable to
specific VCMSSMs, notably those based on minimal supergravity, which require
m_0 = m_{3/2} as well as A_0 = B_0 + m_0. We then display (m_{1/2}, m_0) planes

either a neutralino or the gravitino is the LSP. In particular, we examine in

Above the chiral restoration temperature, only $\rho$'s and $\pi$'s are
present, in that the chirally restored $A_1$ is equivalent to the $\rho$ and
the mesons have an SU(4) symmetry, with no dependence on isospin and negligible
dependence on spin. In the same sense the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ are ""equivalent""
scalars. Thus the chirally restored $\rho\leftrightarrows 2\pi$ exhaust the
interspecies transitions. We evaluate this reaction at $T_c$ and find it to be
much larger than below $T_c$, certainly strong enough to equilibrate the
chirally restored mesons just above $T_c$. When emitted just below $T_c$ the
mesons remain in equilibrium, at least in the chiral limit because of the
Harada-Yamawaki ""vector manifestation"" that requires that mesonic coupling
constants go to zero (in the chiral limit) as $T$ goes to $T_c$ from below. Our
estimates in the chiral limit give deviations in some particle ratios from the
standard scenario (of equilibrium in the hadronic sector just below $T_c$) of
about double those indicated experimentally. This may be due to the neglect of
explicit chiral symmetry breaking in our estimates. We also show that the
instanton molecules present above $T_c$ are the giant multipole vibrations
found by Asakawa, Hatsuda and Nakahara and of Wetzorke et al. in lattice gauge

conformal symmetries that preserve a discretization of S^1 and we get the same

entropy proportional to log\mu_A with a first order correction defined by means
of the relative entropy associated with canonical states.

this paper the {\it critical} generalized KdV equation, which corresponds to
the smallest power of the nonlinearity such that the two conservation laws do
not imply a bound in H^1 uniform in time for all H^1 solutions (and thus global
existence).
  From [15], there do exist for this equation solutions u(t) such that
|u(t)|_{H^1} \to +\infty as T\uparrow T, where T\le +\infty (we call them
blow-up solutions). The question is to describe, in a qualitative way, how blow
up occurs.
  For solutions with L^2 mass close to the minimal mass allowing blow up and
with decay in L^2 at the right, we prove after rescaling and translation which
leave invariant the L^2 norm that the solution converges to a {\it universal}
profile locally in space at the blow-up time T. From the nature of this
profile, we improve the standard lower bound on the blow-up rate for finite

index of the Dolbeault operator of the loop space of a manifold. For manifolds
with vanishing first Chern class, phi_ell becomes a Jacobi form F(z,\tau) for
the full Jacobi group Z^2 x PSL_2(Z). We prove the rigidity of phi_ell for

ring is characterized as the ideal generated by manifolds with S^1-action of
fixed type t (an integer) different from 0.

phi_ell specializes to the Level N genus phi_N. We introduce the cobordism ring
Omega^{U,N} of stably almost complex manifolds with first Chern class divisible

ring Omega^{U,N}.

operators on a Hilbert space are five-diagonal. Orthogonal polynomials on the
unit circle play an essential role in the development of this result, and also
provide a parametrization of such five-diagonal representations which shows
specially simple and interesting decomposition and factorization properties. As
an application we get the reduction of the spectral problem of any unitary
Hessenberg matrix to the spectral problem of a five-diagonal one. Two
applications of these results to the study of orthogonal polynomials on the
unit circle are presented: the first one concerns Krein's Theorem; the second
one deals with the movement of mass points of the orthogonality measure under
monoparametric perturbations of the Schur parameters.

original combinatorial proof using the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma and van der
Waerden's theorem, Furstenberg's proof using ergodic theory, Gowers' proof
using Fourier analysis and the inverse theory of additive combinatorics, and
Gowers' more recent proof using a hypergraph regularity lemma. Of these four,
the ergodic theory proof is arguably the shortest, but also the least
elementary, requiring in particular the use of transfinite induction (and thus
the axiom of choice), decomposing a general ergodic system as the weakly mixing
extension of a transfinite tower of compact extensions. Here we present a
quantitative, self-contained version of this ergodic theory proof, and which is
``elementary'' in the sense that it does not require the axiom of choice, the
use of infinite sets or measures, or the use of the Fourier transform or
inverse theorems from additive combinatorics. It also gives explicit (but
extremely poor) quantitative bounds.

sequential measurements. The measurement scheme distinguishes whether or not
the system is in a specified state $| {f_n}>$ at the $n^{\rm th}$ step, where
$| {f_n}>$ varies with $n$. Dark evolution corresponds to the situation when
all measurements give negative results. We show that dark evolution is unitary
in the continuous measurement limit. We derive the effective Hamiltonian, and
indicate how $| {f_n}>$ controls quantum state transport.

"quant-ph/0405069","Eijiro Sakai","Eijiro Sakai","On the principles of quantum mechanics","38 pages, slightly revised",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose six principles as the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics:
principle of space and time, Galilean principle of relativity, Hamilton's
principle, wave principle, probability principle, and principle of
indestructibility and increatiblity of particles. We deductively develop the
formalism of quantum mechanics on the basis of them: we determine the form of
the Lagrangian that satisfies requirements of these principles, and obtain the
Schroedinger equation from the Lagrangian. We also derive the canonical
commutation relations. Then we adopt the following four guide lines. First, we
do not premise the relations between dynamical variables in classical
mechanics. Second, we define energy, momentum, and angular momentum as the
constants of motion that are derived from homogeneity and isotropy in space and
time on the basis of principle of space and time. Since energy and momentum are
quantitatively defined in classical mechanics, we define them in quantum
mechanics so that the corresponding conservation laws are satisfied in a
coupling system of a quantum particle and a classical particle. Third, we
define Planck's constant and the mass of a particle as proportionality
constants between energy and frequency due to one of Einstein-de Broglie
formulas and between momentum and velocity, respectively. We shall obtain the
canonical commutation relations and the Schroedinger equation for a particle in
an external field in the definitive form. We shall also prove that relations
between dynamical variables in quantum mechanics have the same forms for those
in classical mechanics.
