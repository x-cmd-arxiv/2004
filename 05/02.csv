and cluster elliptical galaxies. We find that the Lick CN indices in the M31

M31, and elliptical spheroids. Although not seen in the Lick CN indices, the
near-UV cyanogen feature (3883 A) is strongly enhanced in M31 clustesr with
respect to the Galactic globulars at metallicities, --1.5<[Fe/H]<--0.3. Carbon
shows signs of varying amongst these two groups. For [Fe/H]>--0.8, we observe
no siginificant differences in the Hdelta, Hgamma, or Hbeta indices between the
M31 and Galactic globulars. The sample of ellipticals lies offset from the loci
of all the globulars in the Cyanogen--[MgFe], and Balmer--[MgFe] planes. Six of
the M31 cluster spectra appear young, and are projected onto the M31 disk.
Population synthesis models suggest that these are metal-rich clusters with
ages 100--800 Myr, metallicities --0.20 < [Fe/H] <0.35, and masses 0.7
-7.0x10^4 Msun. Two other young clusters are Hubble V in NGC 205, and an older
(~3 Gyr) cluster ~7 kpc away from the plane of the disk. The six clusters
projected onto the disk rotate in a similar fashion to the HI gas in M31, and
three clusters exhibit thin disk kinematics (Morrison et al.). Dynamical masses
and structural parameters are required for these objects to determine whether
they are massive open clusters or globular clusters. If the latter, our
findings suggest globular clusters may trace the build up of galaxy disks. In
either case, we conclude that these clusters are part of a young, metal-rich
disk cluster system in M31, possibly as young as 1 Gyr old.

order identifies a depinning transition. We also find that disorder and thermal

F_K$ of primitive Fano varieties of the following two types: either
$F_i\subset{\mathbb P}^M$ is a general hypersurface of degree $M$, $M\geq 6$,
or $F_i\stackrel{\sigma}{\to}{\mathbb P}^M$ is a general double space of index
1, $M\geq 3$. In particular, each structure of a rationally connected fiber
space on $V$ is given by a projection onto a direct factor. The proof is based
on the connectedness principle of Shokurov and Koll\' ar and the technique of
hypertangent divisors.

principle of stationary reflection for P_kappa lambda has been successful in
settling problems of infinite combinatorics in the case kappa=omega_1. For a
greater kappa the principle is known to fail at some lambda. This note shows
that it fails at every lambda if kappa is the successor of a regular
uncountable cardinal or kappa is countably closed.

"math/0405014","Richard Montgomery","Richard Montgomery","Fitting Hyperbolic Pants to a Three-Body Problem",,,,,"math.DS",,"  Consider the three-body problem with an attractive $1/r^2$ potential. Modulo
symmetries, the dynamics of the bounded zero-angular momentum solutions is
equivalent to a geodesic flow on the thrice-punctured sphere, or ``pair of
pants''. The sphere is the shape sphere.
  The punctures are the binary collisions. The metric generating the geodesics
is the Jacobi-Maupertuis metric. The metric is complete, has infinite area, and
its ends, the neighborhoods of the punctures, are asymptotically cylindrical.
Our main result is that when the three masses are equal then the metric has
negative curvature everywhere except at two points (the Lagrange points). A
corollary of this negativity is the uniqueness of the $1/r^2$ figure eight, a
complete symbolic dynamics for encoding the collision-free solutions, and the
fact that collision solutions are dense within the bound solutions.

abstract logic by adding the concept of a syntax and an axiom system. In a
recursive logic frame the syntax and the set of axioms are recursively coded. A
recursive logic frame is called recursively (countably) compact, if every
recursive (respectively, countable) finitely consistent theory has a model. We
show that for logic frames built from the cardinality quantifiers ''there
exists at least lambda'' recursive compactness always implies countable
compactness. On the other hand we show that a recursively compact extension
need not be countably compact.
