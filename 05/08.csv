correlation between u-K colors and atomic-gas-to-stellar mass ratios (G/S),
using stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from optical colors. The correlation
holds for G/S ranging from nearly 10:1 to 1:100 for a sample obtained by
merging the SDSS DR2, 2MASS, and HYPERLEDA HI catalogs. This result implies
that u-K colors can be calibrated to provide ``photometric gas fractions'' for
statistical applications. Here this technique is applied to a sample of ~35,000
SDSS-2MASS galaxies to examine the relationship of gas fractions to observed
bimodalities in galaxy properties as a function of color and stellar mass. The
recently identified transition in galaxy properties at stellar masses
\~2-3x10^10 Msun corresponds to a shift in gas richness, dividing low-mass
late-type galaxies with G/S ~ 1:1 from high-mass galaxies with
intermediate-to-low G/S. Early-type galaxies below the transition mass also
show elevated G/S, consistent with formation scenarios involving mergers of
low-mass gas-rich systems and/or cold-mode gas accretion.

Images that are highly magnified are often part of multiply-imaged systems, but
we consider the possibility of having large magnifications without additional
detectable images. In rare but non-negligible situations, lensing can produce a
singly highly magnified image; this phenomenon is mainly associated with
massive cluster-scale halos (>~1e13.5 Msun). Alternatively, lensing can produce
multiply-imaged systems in which the extra images are either unresolved or too
faint to be detectable. This phenomenon is dominated by galaxies and lower-mass
halos (<~1e12 Msun), and is very sensitive to the inner density profile of the
halos. Although we study the general problem, we customize our calculations to
four quasars at redshift z~6 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for which
Richards et al. (2004) have ruled out the presence of extra images down to an
image splitting of 0.3"" and a flux ratio of f=0.01. We predict that 9-29% of
all z~6 quasars that are magnified by a factor of mu>10 would lack detectable
extra images, with 5-10% being true singly-imaged systems. The maximum of 29%
is reached only in the unlikely event that all low-mass (<~1e10 Msun) halos
have highly concentrated (isothermal) profiles. In more realistic models where
dwarf halos have flatter (NFW) inner profiles, the maximum probability is ~10%.
We conclude that the probability that all four SDSS quasars are magnified by a
factor of 10 is <~1e-4. The only escape from this conclusion is if there are
many (>10) multiply-imaged z~6 quasars in the SDSS database that have not yet
been identified, which seems unlikely. In other words, lensing cannot explain
the brightnesses of the z~6 quasars, and models that invoke lensing to avoid
having billion-Msun black holes in the young universe are not viable.

(LC) a bump that has been interpreted as the signature of a supernova (SN).
After subtracting the afterglow component from the observed optical LC of the
XRF counterpart, the properties of the putative SN are constrained by means of
synthetic LCs of core-collapse SNe. For the redshift range $z \sim 0.3$ -- 1,
all possible models require a rather small mass of synthesized \Nifs, i.e.
$M$(\Nifs) $\sim$ 0.01 -- 0.3 $\Msun$. The models used to describe the
energetic SNe Ic associated with gamma-ray bursts (SNe 1998bw and 2003dh) are
too massive for the observed LC. If the relation between ejected \Nifs mass and
total ejecta mass established from models of various Type Ic SNe also holds for
the putative SN in XRF 030723, the ejecta mass is constrained to be $\sim$ 1 --
3 $\Msun$ and the kinetic energy $\lsim 1\times 10^{52}$ erg. This corresponds
to a progenitor with $15\Msun \lesssim M_{\rm MS}\lesssim 25\Msun$. The SN
therefore appears to have properties intermediate between a normal SN Ic like
SN 1994I and a more energetic object like SN 2002ap.

The WFC 2-28 keV data, reported here for the first time, were collected over a
period of about five years, from September 1996 to October 2001. These
observations, although not evenly distributed, show that Mkn 501, after going
through a very active phase from spring 1997 to early 1999, remained in a low
brightness state until late 2001. The data from the LECS, MECS and PDS
instruments, covering the wide energy interval 0.1-150 keV, have been used to
study in detail the spectral variability of the source. We show that the X-ray
energy distribution of Mkn 501 is well described by a log-parabolic law in all
luminosity states. This model allowed us to obtain good estimates of the SED
synchrotron peak energy and of its associated power. The strong spectral
variability observed, consisting of strictly correlated changes between the
synchrotron peak energy and bolometric flux, suggests that the main physical
changes are not only due to variations of the maximum Lorentz factor of the
emitting particles but that other quantities must be varying as well. During
the 1997 flare the high energy part of the spectrum of Mkn 501 shows evidence
of an excess above the best fit log-parabolic law suggesting the existence of a
second emission component that may be responsible for most of the observed
variability.

collisions with neutral hydrogen in NLTE line formation calculations of the

one-dimensional theoretical model atmosphere, we find that the sodium
transition, formed in higher layers, is much more effectively thermalized by
hydrogen collisions than the high-excitation oxygen lines. This result appears
as a simple consequence of the decrease of the ratio NH/Ne with depth in the
solar photosphere. The center-to-limb variation of the selected lines is
studied both under LTE and NLTE conditions. In the NLTE analysis, inelastic
collisions with hydrogen atoms are considered with a simple approximation or
neglected, in an attempt to test the validity of such approximation. For the
sodium line studied, the best agreement between theory and observation happens
when NLTE is considered and inelastic collisions with hydrogen are neglected in
the rate equations. The analysis of the oxygen triplet benefits from a very
detailed calculation using an LTE three-dimensional model atmosphere and NLTE
line formation. The chi**2 statistics favors including hydrogen collisions with
the approximation adopted, but the oxygen abundance derived in that case is
significantly higher than the value derived from OH infrared transitions.

afflicted by gauge artifacts and directly map the apparent evolution of
inhomogeneities to local interactions of cosmological species. Considering
nonlinear and linear perturbations of phase-space distribution, radiation
intensity and arbitrary species' density, we require that: (i) the dynamics of
perturbations defined by these measures is determined by observables within the
local Hubble volume; (ii) the measures are practically applicable on
microscopic scales and in an unperturbed geometry retain their microscopic
meaning on all scales. We prove that all measures of linear overdensity that
satisfy (i) and (ii) coincide in the superhorizon limit. Their dynamical
equations are simpler than the traditional ones, have a nonsingular
superhorizon limit and explicit Cauchy form. Then we show that, contrary to the
popular view, the perturbations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the
radiation era are not resonantly boosted self-gravitationally during horizon
entry. (Consequently, the CMB signatures of uncoupled species which may be
abundant in the radiation era, e.g. neutrinos or early quintessence, are mild;
albeit non-degenerate and robust to cosmic variance.) On the other hand, dark
matter perturbations in the matter era gravitationally suppress large-angle CMB
anisotropy by an order of magnitude stronger than presently believed. If cold
dark matter were the only dominant component then, for adiabatic perturbations,
the CMB temperature power spectrum C_l would be suppressed 25-fold.

observation a sharp spectral drop is detected with energy that has shifted from
7 keV to 7.5 keV in two years. The drop is interpreted in terms of
relativistically blurred ionised reflection from the accretion disc, while the
energy shift can be accounted for by changes in the ionisation state and, more
importantly, emissivity profile on the disc. A flatter emissivity profile
during the second higher flux observation reduces gravitational redshift
effects, therefore shifting the edge to higher energy. Remarkably, ionised disc
reflection and the associated power law continuum provide a reasonable
description of the broadband spectrum, including the soft excess. Considering
both observations, the spectral variability in 1H 0707-495 appears to be due to
the interplay between these two spectral components. The reflection component
in the second observation is significantly less variable than the power law.
Changes of the emissivity profile, spectral shape and variability properties
(such as the rms spectrum) within the two observations are all consistent with
a recently proposed model in which relativistic effects in the very inner

dwarfs. The proposed scenario follows from relaxing the assumption of symmetry
in the model and involves a detonation created in an unconfined environment.
The explosion begins with an essentially central ignition of stellar material
initiating a deflagration. This deflagration results in the formation of a
buoyantly-driven bubble of hot material that reaches the stellar surface at
supersonic speeds. The bubble breakout forms a strong pressure wave that
laterally accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This material, confined
by gravity to the white dwarf, races along the stellar surface and is focused
at the location opposite to the point of the bubble breakout. These streams of
nuclear fuel carry enough mass and energy to trigger a detonation just above
the stellar surface. The flow conditions at that moment support a detonation
that will incinerate the white dwarf and result in an energetic explosion. The
stellar expansion following the deflagration redistributes stellar mass in a
way that ensures production of intermediate mass and iron group elements
consistent with observations. The ejecta will have a strongly layered structure
with a mild amount of asymmetry following from the early deflagration phase.
This asymmetry, combined with the amount of stellar expansion determined by
details of the evolution (principally the energetics of deflagration, timing of
detonation, and structure of the progenitor), can be expected to create a
family of mildly diverse Type Ia supernova explosions.

performed. Gerhard has suggested that dynamical friction, which causes a
cluster to lose orbital energy and spiral in toward the Galactic center, may
explain the presence of a cluster of very young stars in the central parsec,
where star formation might be prohibitively difficult because of strong tidal
forces. However, numerical simulations by Kim & Morris showed that this is only
possible if the cluster initially has an extremely dense core. Hansen &
Milosavljevic recently suggested that the presence of an IMBH in the cluster
core might stabilize the core against tidal disruption during the inspiral
through dynamical friction, and thus might easily deliver young stars down to
the central parsec. We find that the presence of an IMBH does lower the minimum
initial core density required to transport young stars down to the central
parsec, but this is possible only when the mass of the IMBH is at least ~10% of
the total cluster mass. This fraction is significantly higher than that
estimated by Portegies Zwart & McMillan with numerical simulations of IMBH
formation by successive merging of stars in the cluster core, so it does not
appear that a realistic IMBH can help transport young stars into the central
parsec.

scattering problem. Dividing space into a scattering region and left and right
ideal electrode regions, this problem is solved by wave function matching (WFM)
in the boundary zones connecting these regions. The method is tested on a model
tunnel junction and applied to sodium atomic wires. In particular, we show that
using a high order finite difference approximation of the kinetic energy
operator leads to a high accuracy at moderate computational costs.

Correspondingly, the state supports Goldstone-type low energy, long wave-length

explored from the perspective of an appropriate replica field theory. In terms
of this replica perspective, the lost symmetry is that of relative translations
of the replicas; common translations remain as intact symmetries, reflecting
the statistical homogeneity of the amorphous solid state. What emerges is a
picture of the Goldstone-type fluctuations of the amorphous solid state as
shear deformations of an elastic medium, along with a derivation of the shear
modulus and the elastic free energy of the state. The consequences of these
fluctuations -- which dominate deep inside the amorphous solid state -- for the
order parameter of the amorphous solid state are ascertained and interpreted in
terms of their impact on the statistical distribution of localization lengths,
a central diagnostic of the the state. The correlations of these order
parameter fluctuations are also determined, and are shown to contain
information concerning further diagnostics of the amorphous solid state, such
as spatial correlations in the statistics of the localization characteristics.
Special attention is paid to the properties of the amorphous solid state in two
spatial dimensions, for which it is shown that Goldstone-type fluctuations
destroy particle localization, the order parameter is driven to zero, and
power-law order-parameter correlations hold.

To describe this phenomenon the probabilistic description regarding the jam
emergence as the formation of a large car cluster on highway inside the
synchronized traffic is constructed. In these terms the breakdown occurs
through the formation of a certain critical nucleus in the metastable vehicle
flow, which is located near the on-ramp. The strong cooperative car interaction
in the synchronized traffic enables us to treat the size of critical jam nuclei
as a large value and to apply to an effective one-lane model. This model
assumes the following. First, the growth of a car cluster is governed by the
attachment of cars to the cluster whose rate is mainly specified by the total
traffic flow. Second, the cluster dissolution is determined by the car escape
from the cluster whose rate depends on the cluster size directly. Third, the
generation of one-car clusters (preclusters) is caused by cars entering the
main road from the on-ramp. The appropriate master equation for the car cluster
evolution is written and the generation rate of critical jam nuclei is found.
The obtained results are in agreement with the empirical facts that the
characteristic time scale of the breakdown phenomenon is about or greater than
one minute and the traffic flow rate interval inside which traffic breakdowns
are observed is sufficiently wide. Besides, as a new results, it is shown that
the traffic breakdown probability can be analyzed, at least approximately,
based solely on the data of the total vehicle flow without separating it into
the vehicle streams on the main road and on-ramp when the relative on-ramp flow
volume exceeds 10%--20%.

transition between states with different quantum orders which in our case is

based on Clifford's geometric algebra are especially well adapted for clear
geometric interpretations and computational efficiency. Here we study
relationships between formulations of special relativity in the spacetime
algebra (STA) Cl{1,3} of Minkowski space, and in the algebra of physical space
(APS)Cl{3}. STA lends itself to an absolute formulation of relativity, in which
paths, fields, and other physical properties have observer-independent
representations. Descriptions in APS are related by a one-to-one mapping of
elements from APS to the even subalgebra STA+ of STA. With this mapping,
reversion in APS corresponds to hermitian conjugation in STA. The elements of
STA+ are all that is needed to calculate physically measurable quantities
because only they entail the observer dependence inherent in any physical
measurement. As a consequence, every relativistic physical process that can be
modeled in STA also has a representation in APS, and vice versa. In the
presence of two or more inertial observers, two versions of APS present
themselves. In the absolute version, both the mapping to STA+ and hermitian
conjugation are observer dependent, and the proper basis vectors are persistent
vectors that sweep out timelike planes. In the relative version, the mapping
and hermitian conjugation are then the same for all observers. Relative APS
gives a covariant representation of relativistic physics with spacetime
multivectors represented by multiparavectors. We relate the two versions of APS
as consistent models within the same algebra.

virtues of T-duality is that $h_1$-twisted K-theory of $E_1$ is isomorphic to
$h_2$-twisted K-theory of $E_2$. In this paper, a new, very topological concept

construct a universal dual pair to a given pair. Our construction immediately
gives a number of known and new properties of the dual. In particular it
implies existence of a dual of any pair (E,h), and it also describes the
ambiguity upto which the dual is well defined. In order to deal with twisted
K-theory, some care is needed, in particular when dealing with naturality
questions, because the twisted K-theory depends on the explicit model for the
twists and the twisted theory --care which is missing in some of the existing
literature. We illustrate the use of T-duality by some explicit calculations of

understanding of the residue theorem. One application of the residue theorem is
a concise proof of Dyson's conjecture.

algorithm is fast and uses little storage space. It also results in an
efficient algorithm for MacMahon's partition analysis and related constant term

representation of a p-adic analytic group on a locally convex p-adic
topological vector space the associated space of locally analytic vectors.
Using this functor, and the point of view that its construction suggests, we
establish some basic facts about admissible locally analytic representations
(as defined by Schneider and Teitelbaum). We also introduce the related notion
of essentially admissible locally analytic representations.

Gr(m,n,F) induces a continuous representation of the maximal compact subgroup

  This paper connects the Archimedean and non-Archimedean theories using the

dispersion superimposed by random modulations with a zero mean. The second type
is the dispersion-managed fiber line with fluctuating parameters of the

Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) with a dissipation term, expressed by a 4th order
derivative of the wave envelope. The prediction of the mean field approach
regarding the decay rate of a soliton is compared with that of the perturbation
theory based on the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). A good agreement
between these two approaches is found. Possible ways of compensation of the
radiative decay of solitons using the linear and nonlinear amplification are
explored. Corresponding mean field equation coincides with the complex
Swift-Hohenberg equation. The condition for the autosolitonic regime in
propagation of optical pulses along a fiber line with fluctuating dispersion is
derived and the existence of autosoliton (dissipative soliton) is confirmed by
direct numerical simulation of the stochastic NLSE. The dynamics of solitons in
optical communication systems with random dispersion-management is further
studied applying the variational principle to the mean field NLSE, which
results in a system of ODE's for soliton parameters. Extensive numerical
simulations of the stochastic NLSE, mean field equation and corresponding set
of ODE's are performed to verify the predictions of the developed theory.

hole. The quantum yield for the electron photobleaching is ca. 0.28 for 532 nm

contributions from trapped electron and hole is demonstrated using glycerol as
a selective hole scavenger. When glycerol is added to the solution, some

can transform the sixteen error syndromes occurring in the error-correcting

the effect of its associated sequence of basic quantum unilateral and bilateral

creating the Boolean function and its associated sequence of operations so that
we can do the job in an analytical way without any trial and error effort.
Consequently, all possible Boolean functions can in principle be created by
using our method. Furthermore, for a deduced Boolean function, we can also in
the spirit of our method derive its best associated sequence of operations
