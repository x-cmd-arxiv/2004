on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Scalar
fluctuations give rise only to parity-even E-type polarization of the CMB.
However in the presence of a magnetic field, a non-vanishing parity-odd B-type
polarization component is produced through Faraday rotation. We derive the
exact solution for the E and B modes generated by scalar perturbations
including the Faraday rotation effect of a uniform magnetic field, and evaluate
their cross-correlations with temperature anisotropies. We compute the angular
autocorrelation function of the B-modes in the limit that the Faraday rotation
is small. We find that primordial magnetic fields of present strength around
$B_0=10^{-9}$G rotate E-modes into B-modes with amplitude comparable to those
due to the weak gravitational lensing effect at frequencies around $\nu=30$
GHz. The strength of B-modes produced by Faraday rotation scales as
$B_0/\nu^2$. We evaluate also the depolarizing effect of Faraday rotation upon
the cross correlation between temperature anisotropy and E-type polarization.

r>(1.5 - 2)R_0 (where R_0 is the photometric radial scalelength of a disk),
found in the literature, with the minimal values of c_r necessary for the disk
to be in a stable state, using the results of numerical simulations of 3D

local surface density and (if R_0 is known) a total masses of a disk and a dark
halo. We argue that the old stellar disks of spiral galaxies with active star
formation usually have the velocity dispersions which are close to the expected
marginal values. A rough values of disk-to-total mass ratios (within the fixed

35 kpc from the center of the galaxy along the southeast minor axis. At this

definitely present, after statistical subtraction of field contamination. We
derive the metallicity distribution (MDF) for the halo stars using
interpolation within a standard (I,V-I) grid of RGB evolutionary tracks. The
halo MDF is quite broad but dominated by a moderately high-metallicity
population peaking at [m/H] ~ -0.5, strikingly different from the [m/H] ~ -1.3
level which characterizes the outer halo of the Milky Way. However,the shape
and peak metallicity for this region are entirely similar to those found in
other studies for the inner regions of the M31 halo, particularly our previous
study of a 20-kpc region (Durrell, Harris, & Pritchet 2001) employing similar

change in the MDF out to quite large distances in the M31 halo: it appears to
be a homogeneous and moderately metal-rich subsystem of the galaxy at all
locations. The star counts in the 30-kpc field are also consistent with the
r^1/4 law that fits the interior regions of the M31 spheroid surface brightness
profile. The metal-rich MDF and the r^1/4 spheroid suggests M31 more strongly
resembles a giant elliptical galaxy than other, Milky-Way-like, spirals.

variable orientation. We compute the bias in the pseudo-$C_l$ power spectrum
estimator and then construct an unbiased estimator using the bias matrix. The
covariance matrix of the unbiased estimator is computed for smooth,
non-circular beams. Quantitative results are shown for CMB maps made by a
\emph{hypothetical} experiment with a non-circular beam comparable to our fits
to the WMAP beam maps described in the appendix and uses a \emph{toy} scan
strategy. We find that significant effects on CMB power spectrum can arise due
to non-circular beam on multipoles comparable to, and beyond, the inverse
average beam-width where the pseudo-$C_l$ approach may be the method of choice
due to computational limitations of analyzing the large datasets from current

the universe becomes mostly neutral resulting also in a sharp drop in the

into the intergalactic medium (IGM) via ambipolar diffusion and, for small
enough scales, by generating decaying MHD turbulence. These processes can
significantly modify the thermal and ionization history of the
post-recombination universe. We show that the dissipation effects of magnetic
fields which redshifts to a present value $B_{0}=3\times 10^{-9}$ Gauss
smoothed on the magnetic Jeans scale and below, can give rise to Thomson
scattering optical depths $\tau \ga 0.1$, although not in the range of

study the possibility that primordial fields could induce the formation of
subgalactic structures for $z \ga 15$. We show that early structure formation
induced by nano-Gauss magnetic fields is potentially capable of producing the
early re-ionization implied by the WMAP data. Future CMB observations will be
very useful to probe the modified ionization histories produced by primordial

exchange processes. Solutions to this problem have been offered in the
literature, all relying on the assumption that the proton fluid, even under
evidently nonequilibrium conditions, can be expected to stay in a
highly-relaxated distribution function given by mono-Maxwellians shifted by the
local proton bulk velocity. Here we check the validity of this assumption,
calculating on the basis of a Boltzmann-kinetic approach the actually occurring
deviations. As we show, especially for low degrees of ionization, $\xi \le
0.3$, both the H-atoms and protons involved do generate in the heliospheric
interface clearly pronounced deviations from shifted Maxwellians with
asymmetrically shaped distribution functions giving rise to non-convective
transport processes and heat conduction flows. Also in the inner heliosheath
region and in the heliotail deviations of the proton distribution from the
hydrodynamic one must be expected. This sheds new light on the correctness of
current calculations of H-atom distribution functions prevailing in the inner
heliosphere and also of the Lyman-$\alpha $ absorption features in stellar
spectra due to the presence of the hydrogen wall atoms. Deviations from
LTE-functions would be even more pronounced in magnetic interfaces, which via

defined, associated to these universality classes, a scaling exponent as

obtain $ 1 \gtrsim \kappa \gtrsim 0.5 $. The behavior of this scaling exponent,

chiralities and lengths have been simulated with a classical molecular dynamics
method employing the many-body empirical Tersoff-Brenner potential. Stress has
been achieved by enforcing constant linear velocity on the edge atoms from both
sides of the SWCNT as suggested by Srivastava and Barnard. We have found
opposite length scaling at fast (1/10 of vs the sound velocity in carbon tubes)
and slow (1/20 vs) loading of (10, 0) tubes. Another finding is that at fast
loading short zigzag (10, 0) tubes transform from elastic to plastic states
before they break in the middle, while tubes, longer than 13 nm, break-up
directly in the elastic state. Thus, short tubes behave like metals or ionic
solids, while long tubes resemble ceramics or glasses under the conditions
studied. All tubes form spiral-like structures when twisted. Standing waves,
generated under specific conditions, determine the different behavior of tubes
with various lengths and chiralities.

managing and coordinating distributed resources. The resultant prototype is
expected to harness the use of huge amounts of medical image data to perform
epidemiological studies, advanced image processing, radiographic education and
ultimately, tele-diagnosis over communities of medical virtual organisations.
The MammoGrid prototype comprises a high-quality clinician visualization
workstation used for data acquisition and inspection, a DICOM-compliant
interface to a set of medical services (annotation, security, image analysis,
data storage and querying services) residing on a so-called Grid-box and secure
access to a network of other Grid-boxes connected through Grid middleware. This
paper outlines the MammoGrid approach in managing a federation of
Grid-connected mammography databases in the context of the recently delivered

the nature of the timelike curves is clarified. A helicoidal surface unifies

flavor-singlet pseudoscalar ``hairpin'' vertex associated with the eta prime
mass was studied for pion masses ranging from approximately 275 to 675 MeV.
Throughout this mass range, the quark-disconnected pseudoscalar correlator is
well-described by a pure double-pion-pole diagram with a p^2 independent mass
insertion. The residue of the double pole was found to exhibit a significant
quark mass dependence, evidenced by a negative slope of the effective mass
insertion (m_0^{eff})^2 as a function of m_{\pi}^2. It has been observed by
Sharpe that, with a consistent NLO calculation in quenched chiral perturbation
theory, this mass dependence is uniquely predicted in terms of the single-pole
coefficient \alpha_{\Phi} and the Leutwyler parameter L_5. Since \alpha_{\Phi}
is found to be approximately zero, the chiral slope of the double-pole residue
determines a value for L_5. This provides a consistency check between the
chiral slope of the hairpin mass insertion and that of the pion decay constant.
We investigate the consistency of these mass dependences in our Monte Carlo
results at two values of lattice spacing. Within statistics, the slopes are
found to be consistent with the Q\chiPT prediction, confirming that the
observed negative slope of m_0^{eff} arises as an effect of the L_5 Leutwyler
term.

possibly and significantly changes the detected neutrino signal from galactic
supernova explosions. We focus on the appearance of a sharp peak due to a
neutronization burst in the time profile; this phenomenon would occur if the
original \nu_e, produced at the neutrinosphere and becoming \nu_{2,3} at the
stellar surface, decays into a lighter antineutrino state such as \bar\nu_{1,2}
coupled to \bar\nu_e. This is due to the fact that the signature of the
neutronization burst is common to all numerical simulations. Therefore, the
appearance of a neutronization peak in the \bar\nu_e signal, if it were
detected, would clearly indicate the nonstandard properties of neutrinos. Using
a newly developed formulation that includes flavor conversions inside the
supernova envelope and neutrino decay during propagation in a vacuum, we
calculate the expected neutrino signal at the detectors; the lifetimes of three
modes \tau_{12}, \tau_{13}, and \tau_{23} are taken to be free parameters. We
further introduce simple quantities, which represent a peak sharpness of time
profile and spectral hardness, and investigate the parameter dependence of
these quantities. As the result, it is found that they are quite dependent on
the relevant parameters, but it would be quite difficult to distinguish models
using the signal obtained by the Super-Kamiokande detector; the future
megaton-class detectors would have sufficient sensitivity. We also compare the
neutrino decay model with another mechanism, i.e., resonant spin-flavor
conversion, which also may give the appearance of a neutronization peak, and
conclude that these two independent mechanisms give a different signal and one
can be distinguished from the other.

mixing. First, the bimaximal neutrino mixing together with U_{e3}=0 is
guaranteed to appear owing to S_2 and, then, the bilarge neutrino mixing
together with |U_{e3}|<<1 arises as a result of tiny violation of S_2. The
observed mass hierarchy of \Delta m^2_{\odot}<<\Delta m^2_{atm} is subject to
another tiny violation of the electron number conservation. This scenario is
realized in a specific model based on SU(3)_L x U(1)_N with two-loop radiative
mechanism for neutrino masses. The radiative effects from heavy leptons
contained in lepton triplets generate the bimaximal structure and those from
charged leptons, which break S_2, generate the bilarge structure together with
|U_{e3}|<<1. To suppress dangerous flavor-changing neutral current interactions
due to Higgs exchanges especially for quarks, this S_2 symmetry is extended to
a discrete Z_8 symmetry, which also ensures the absence of one-loop radiative
mechanism.

accord with recent WMAP results on the dark matter density of the universe. We
find that the IceCube neutrino telescope as well as 3rd generation direct dark
matter detection experiments should be able to cover the {\it entire} WMAP
allowed portion of the hyperbolic branch/focus point (HB/FP) region of
parameter space. This is in contrast to the case of the CERN LHC or a linear
$e^+e^-$ collider, where only a fraction of the HB/FP region can be accessed.
In addition, we show that detection of $\gamma$s, $e^+$s and $\bar{p}$s should
occur in much of the HB/FP region, as well as in the low $m_{1/2}$ portion of
the $A$ annihilation funnel, and will be complementary to searches via
colliders in these regions.

  algebraic varieties","32 pages, no figures, some misprints and list of authors corrected,

for singular complex algebraic varieties. First we introduce a natural
transformation T_{y}: K_{0}(var/X) -> H_{*}(X,Q)[y] commuting with proper
pushdown, which generalizes the corresponding Hirzebruch characteristic. Here
K_{0}(var/X) is the relative Grothendieck group of complex algebraic varieties
over X as introduced and studied by Looijenga and Bittner in relation to
motivic integration. T_{y} is a homology class version of the motivic measure
corresponding to a suitable specialization of the well known Hodge polynomial.
This transformation unifies the Chern class transformation of MacPherson and
Schwartz (for y=-1) and the Todd class transformation in the singular
Riemann-Roch theorem of Baum-Fulton-MacPherson (for y=0). In fact, T_{y} is the
composition of a generalized version of this Todd class transformation due to
Yokura, and a new motivic Chern class transformation mC_{*}: K_{0}(var/X)->
G_{0}(X)[y], which generalizes the total lambda-class of the cotangent bundle
to singular spaces. Here G_{0}(X) is the Grothendieck group of coherent
sheaves, and the construction of mC_{*} is based on some results from the
theory of algebraic mixed Hodge modules due to M.Saito. In the final part of
the paper we use the algebraic cobordism theory of Levine and Morel to lift
mC_{*} further up to a natural transformation mC'_{*} from K_{0}(var/X) to a
suitable universal Borel-Moore weak homology theory. Moreover, all our results
can be extended to varieties over a base field k, which can be embedded into
the complex numbers.

  Submitted to NOVA Science Publishers (NY) volume ""Progress in Field Theory
  Research""",,,,"nucl-th",,"  Recent progress in Lorentz-covariant quantum field theories of the nuclear
many-body problem (quantum hadrodynamics or QHD) is discussed. The effective
field theory studied here contains nucleons, pions, isoscalar scalar (\sigma)
and vector (\omega) fields, and isovector vector (\rho) fields. The theory
exhibits a nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken SU(2) \times SU(2)
chiral symmetry and has three desirable features: it uses the same degrees of
freedom to describe the nuclear currents and the strong-interaction dynamics,
it satisfies the symmetries of the underlying theory of QCD, and its parameters
can be calibrated using strong-interaction phenomena, like hadron scattering or
the empirical properties of finite nuclei. Moreover, it has recently been
verified that for normal nuclear systems, it is possible to expand the
effective lagrangian systematically in powers of the meson fields (and their
derivatives) and to truncate the expansion reliably after the first few orders.
Using a mean-field version of the energy functional, accurate quantitative
results are obtained for the bulk and single-particle properties of medium- and
heavy-mass nuclei. The importance of modern perspectives in effective field
theory and density functional theory for understanding these successes of QHD
is emphasized. The inclusion of hadronic electromagnetic structure and of
nonanalytic terms in the energy functional is also considered briefly.
Weak-interaction currents are also studied in this QHD framework. Expressions
for the axial-vector current, evaluated through the first few orders in the
field expansion, satisfy both PCAC and the Goldberger--Treiman relation.
Moreover, the corresponding vector and axial-vector charges satisfy the
familiar chiral charge algebra to all orders in the pion field.

instant- and front-form approaches, where it takes the form of a 3-dimensional
delta function, the relation is given here by a Lorentz-scalar constraint.
Thus, in the c.m. frame, the sum of the constituent momenta, which differs from
zero off-energy shell, has no fixed direction, in accordance with the absence
of preferred direction on a hyperboloid surface. To some extent, this gives
rise to an extra degree of freedom entering the description of the system of
interest. The development of a consistent formalism within this picture is
described. Comparison with other approaches is made.

that double-charm hyperons are likely to form bound (or possibly meta-stable)
states akin to the deuteron in the spin triplet state. Double beauty baryons
would form corresponding deeply bound states. Nucleons and double charm

recirculating linear accelerators, in which the bunches do not have to be at
the same RF phase during each recirculation turn. This is important for the
description of energy recovery linacs (ERLs) where bunches are recirculated at
a decelerating phase of the RF wave and for other recirculator arrangements
where different RF phases are of an advantage. Furthermore it can be used for
the analysis of phase errors of recirculated bunches. It is shown how the
threshold current for a given linac can be computed and a remarkable agreement
with tracking data is demonstrated. The general formulas are then analyzed for
several analytically solvable cases, which show: (a) Why different higher order
modes (HOM) in one cavity do not couple so that the most dangerous modes can be
considered individually. (b) How different HOM frequencies have to be in order
to consider them separately. (c) That no optics can cause the HOMs of two
cavities to cancel. (d) How an optics can avoid the addition of the
instabilities of two cavities. (e) How a HOM in a multiple-turn recirculator
interferes with itself. Furthermore, a simple method to compute the orbit
deviations produced by cavity misalignments has also been introduced. It is
shown that the BBU instability always occurs before the orbit excursion becomes
very large.

  We furthermore analyze whether it is beneficial to place the crab cavity at a

worth while if the horizontal tune is close to a half integer, but not if it is
close to an integer. Furthermore we find that stop-bands can be avoided when
the horizontal tune is located at a favorable side of the integer or the half

precession can be periodically driven by Fourier components of the
electromagnetic fields through which the particles travel. This leads to
resonant perturbations when the spin-precession frequency is close to a linear
combination of the orbital frequencies. When such resonance conditions are
crossed, partial depolarization or spin flip can occur. The amount of
polarization that survives after resonance crossing is a function of the
resonance strength and the crossing speed. This function is commonly called the
Froissart-Stora formula. It is very useful for predicting the amount of
polarization after an acceleration cycle of a synchrotron or for computing the
required speed of the acceleration cycle to maintain a required amount of
polarization. However, the resonance strength could in general only be computed
for first-order resonances and for synchrotron sidebands. When Siberian Snakes
adjust the spin tune to be 1/2, as is required for high energy accelerators,
first-order resonances do not appear and higher-order resonances become
dominant. Here we will introduce the strength of a higher-order spin-orbit
resonance, and also present an efficient method of computing it. Several
tracking examples will show that the so computed resonance strength can indeed
be used in the Froissart-Stora formula. HERA-p is used for these examples which

First-order resonance effects can be avoided by installing Siberian Snakes in
the ring, devices which rotate the spin by 180 degrees around the snake axis
while not changing the beam's orbit significantly. For large rings, several
Siberian Snakes are required.
  Here a criterion will be derived that allows to find an optimal choice of the
snake axes. Rings with super-period four are analyzed in detail, and the HERA
proton ring is used as an example for approximate four-fold symmetry. The
proposed arrangement of Siberian Snakes matches their effects so that all
spin-orbit coupling integrals vanish at all energies and therefore there is no
first-order spin-orbit coupling at all for this choice, which I call snakes
matching. It will be shown that in general at least eight Siberian Snakes are
needed and that there are exactly four possibilities to arrange their axes.
When the betatron phase advance between snakes is chosen suitably, four
Siberian Snakes can be sufficient.

In these lectures, Hilbert expounds in an unusually explicit manner his
epistemological perspective on science as a subdiscipline of an all embracing
science of mathematics. The starting point of Hilbert's considerations is the
claim that the class of gravitational and electromagnetic field equations
implied by his original variational formulation of 1915 provides valid
candidate `world equations,' even in view of attempts at unified field theories
\'a la Weyl and Eddington based on the concept of the affine connection. We

philosophical viewpoints expressed in these lectures.
