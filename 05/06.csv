transients and periodic sources like pulsars. The optical pulse of the Crab
pulsar was detected with the HEGRA CT1 central pixel using a modified PM,
similar to the future MAGIC camera PMs. The purpose of these periodic

  Research""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the recent efforts to use a sub-class of neutron-star X-ray
transients (the quasi-persistent transients) to probe the properties of
neutron-star crusts and cores. Quasi-persistent X-ray transients experience
accretion episodes lasting years to decades, instead of the usual weeks to
months of ordinary, short-duration transients. These prolonged accretion
episodes should significantly heat the crusts of the neutron stars in these
systems, bringing the crusts out of thermal equilibrium with their neutron-star
cores. When these systems are back in quiescence, i.e. when no more accretion
onto the neutron-star surfaces occurs, then the crusts should thermally radiate
in X-rays, cooling them down until they are again in thermal equilibrium with
the cores. In this chapter we discuss the recent X-ray monitoring campaigns we
performed (using the X-ray satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton) to study several
quasi-persistent neutron-star X-ray transients in their quiescent states. These
observations gave us, for the first time, a detailed look into the cooling
curves of accretion heated neutron-star crusts. In this chapter, we discuss how
these crust cooling curves can provide insight into the structure of neutron
stars.

performed to derive the most reliable set of modelling parameters. We have
found that an evolutionary age of about 26.8 Myrs fits both components in the
same isochrone. The positions of EK Cep A and B in the HR diagram are
consistent (within the observational uncertainties) with our results.
  Our revised calibration shows clearly that EK Cep is in the beginning of the
main sequence, while EK Cep B is indeed a PMS star. Such a combination allows
for a precise age determination of the binary, and provides a strict test of
the modelling. In particular we have found that the definition of the time step
in calculating the PMS evolution is crucial to reproduce the observations. A
discussion of the optimal time step for calculating PMS evolution is presented.
  The fitting to the radii of both components is a more difficult task;
although we managed to do it for EK Cep B, EK Cep A has a lower radius than our
best models.
  We further studied the effect of the inclusion of a moderate convective
overshooting; the calibration of the binary is not significantly altered, but
the effect of the inclusion of overshooting can be dramatic in the approach to
the main sequence of stars with masses high enough to burn hydrogen through the
CNO cycle on the main sequence.

WNB1829+6911, fossil radio lobes are seen in conjunction with newly restarting

with clusters implies that the pressure of the dense intracluster medium,

0.3-0.4arcsec or 6-8pc (for a distance d=4.1Mpc). The double star cluster, also
a bright double source of Pa-alpha emission, appears to be coincident with the
double radio nebula detected at 1.3cm. The eastern near-infrared star cluster
(C1) is identified with the youngest optical cluster, whereas the western star
cluster (C2), although it is almost completely obscured in the optical, becomes
the brightest star cluster in the central region of NGC 5253 at wavelengths
longer than 2micron. Both clusters are extremely young with ages of
approximately 3.5 million years old. C2 is more massive than C1 by a factor of
6 to 20 (M(C2)= 7.7 x 10^5 - 2.6 x 10^6Msun, for a Salpeter IMF in the mass
range 0.1-100Msun). Analysis of the circumnuclear spectrum excluding C1 and C2,
as well as of a number of other near-infrared selected clusters with a range of
(young) ages, suggests that the star formation was triggered across the central
regions of the galaxy. We have also modelled the nuclear UV to mid-infrared
spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC5253 and found that the infrared part
is well modelled with a highly obscured (A_V= 17mag) young starburst with a
stellar mass consistent with our photometric estimates for C1 and C2. The SED
model predicts a moderately bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
feature at 3.3micron that is not detected in our nuclear L-band spectrum.
NGC5253's low metallicity and a top-heavy IMF likely combine to suppress the
3.3micron PAH emission that is commonly seen in more massive starburst systems.

ongoing process, linked to infall and stripping events. The unbound star

formation of the ICL, with stars stripped preferentially from the outer parts
of their stellar distributions. Simulated observations of planetary nebulae
(PNe) show significant substructure in velocity space. Despite this, individual
intracluster PNe might be useful mass tracers if more than 5 fields at a range
of radii have measured line-of-sight velocities, where an accurate mass
calculation depends more on the number of fields than the number of PNe
measured per field. However, the orbits of IC stars are more anisotropic than
those of galaxies or dark matter, which leads to a systematic underestimate of
cluster mass relative to that calculated with galaxies, if not accounted for in
dynamical models. Overall, the properties of ICL formed in a hierarchical
scenario are in good agreement with current observations. (Abridged)

qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of a
black hole shadow casted by a rotating black hole on an optically thick
accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black hole. We
have found black hole shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely
different black hole spin parameters and a same black hole mass. Thus, it is
practically difficult to determine a spin parameter of a black hole from a size
and a shape of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk. We newly introduce a
bisector axis of a black hole shadow named a shadow axis. For a rotating black
hole a shape and a position of a black hole shadow are not symmetric with
respect to a rotation axis of a black hole shadow. So, in this case the minimum
interval between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis is finite. An
extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of
a black hole for a fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis of a black
hole and a direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter of a
black hole, if a shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially
important to determine a position of a mass center of a black hole in a region
of a black hole shadow.

region. The observed continuum emission shows three prominent regions with both
flat and steep spectral indexes. The hydroxyl (OH) emission detected by the EVN
measurements accounts for only 12 percent of the total OH emission in Mrk 273,
but it does show the same dominant 1667 MHz line emission components as the
WSRT observations. The spatial distribution of the maser emission provides a
high resolution view of the molecular environment in the nuclear region. The OH
emission has only been detected toward a distinct radio source in the northern
nucleus with a spatial extent of 108 pc. The OH emission is only partially
superposed on the radio continuum and is associated with the near-infrared
emission source. The low pump efficiency of the maser and the OH main-line
ratio suggest that this emission originates in an optically thin and
unsaturated maser environment with a complex pumping scheme that cannot be
explained by radiative infrared pumping with a single dust temperature. The
specific line emission pattern and the line-of-sight velocities indicate the
organized structure of an edge-on disk/TORUS with a Keplerian rotation
surrounding a central object with a binding mass of (1.39+-0.16)x10^9 M_sun.

in different wavelength. In the present paper we will discuss the effect of
neutralino annihilation in the halo of our Galaxy and in its center. According
to high resolution cold dark matter simulations, large virialized halos are
formed through the constant merging of smaller halos appeared at previous
times. At each epoch, dark matter halos have then a clumpy component which is
made of these merging subhalos. The annihilation of dark matter in these
clumps, always present in the halo of our Galaxy, may be responsible for
appreciable fluxes of $\gamma$-rays, potentially detectable. We find that,
depending on the fundamental parameters of the clump density profile and on the
distribution of clumps in the Galactic halo, the contribution to the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray background from clumps could be used to obtain constraints on the
neutralino properties such as mass and annihilation cross section. On the other
hand the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the galactic center may
result in radio signals. At the galactic center, infact, the accretion flow
onto the central black hole sustains strong magnetic fields that can induce
synchrotron emission, in the radio wavelength, by electrons and positrons
generated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the black hole. We
find that the observed emission from the galactic center is consistent with
neutralinos following a Navarro Frenk and White density profile at the galactic
center while it is inconsistent with the presence of a spike density profile,
supposed to be generated by the formation history of the central black hole.

3850.9$^{+904}_{-767}$ days. The corresponding total mass is
0.146$^{+0.016}_{-0.006}$ M$_{\sun}$, with uncertainties depending on the

been obtained with HST/STIS, allowing us to measure the spectral types of the

presence of upper limits. From the data it appears that interacting galaxies
have a higher gas content than normal ones. Galaxies classified as ellipticals
have both a dust and gas content one order of magnitude higher than normal.
Spirals have in most part a normal dust and HI content but an higher molecular
gas mass. The X-ray luminosity also appears higher than that of normal galaxies
of same morphological type, both including or excluding AGNs. We considered the
alternative possibilities that the molecular gas excess may derive from the
existence of tidal torques which produce gas infall from the surrounding
regions or from a different metallicity which affects the X conversion factor
between the observed CO line luminosity and the H$_2$ calculated mass.
According to our tests, it appears that interacting galaxies possess a higher
molecular mass than normal galaxies but with a similar star formation
efficiency.

unable to resolve the lens galaxy from the bright lensed images. Using the new

unmasked, we find a value for Hubble's constant of 70+/-5 km/s /Mpc (95%

XMM-Newton that separate spectrally and/or spatially radio-related and hot-gas
X-ray emission. Originally observed as part of a programme to trace clusters of
galaxies at high redshift, none of the sources is found to lie in a rich
X-ray-emitting environment similar to those of some powerful radio galaxies at
low redshift, although the estimated gas pressures are sufficient to confine
the radio lobes. The weak gas emission is a particularly interesting result for
3C 184, where a gravitational arc is seen, suggesting the presence of a very
massive cluster. Here Chandra data complement the XMM-Newton measurements in
spatially separating X-ray extended emission from that associated with the
nucleus and rather small radio source. 3C 292 is the source for which the
X-ray-emitting gas is measured with the greatest accuracy, and its temperature
of 2 keV and luminosity of 6.5E43 erg/s are both characteristic of a poor
cluster. This source allows the most accurate measurement of inverse-Compton
X-ray emission associated with the radio lobes. In all structures where the

presented so far gives an oversimplified picture of its operation. For example,
the imaginary part of the metal dielectric constant severely limits the
surface-plasmon propagation and the shortest attainable wavelength in most
cases, which in turn limits the microscope magnification. Here I describe how
this limitation has been overcome in the experiment, and analyze the practical
limits on the surface plasmon microscope resolution. In addition, I present
more experimental results, which strongly support the conclusion of extremely
high spatial resolution of the surface plasmon microscope.

Therefore it is of central importance to determine the symmetry of the order

angular-controlled thermal conductivity in the vortex state provides a unique
means of investigating the nodal structure of the superconducting energy gap
when high-quality single crystals in the extremely clean limit are available.
Using this method, Izawa et al have recently succeeded in identifying the

magnetism and itinerant-electron magnetism in the t-J model on a quasi-two
dimensional lattice. The Kondo temperature T_K is defined as a characteristic
temperature or energy scale of local quantum spin fluctuations. Magnetism with
T_N >> T_K, where T_N is the N\eel temperature, is characterized as
local-moment one, while magnetism with T_N << T_K is characterized as
itinerant-electron one. The Kondo temperature, which also gives a measure of
the strength of the quenching of magnetic moments, is renormalized by the Fock
term of the superexchange interaction. Because the renormalization depends on
life-time widths \gamma of quasiparticles in such a way that T_K is higher for
smaller \gamma, T_N can be controlled by disorder. The asymmetry of T_N between
electron-doped and hole-doped cuprates must mainly arise from that of disorder;
an almost symmetric behavior of T_N must be restored if we can prepare
hole-doped and electron-doped cuprates with similar degree of disorder to each
other. Because effective disorder is enhanced by magnetic fields in Kondo
lattices, antiferromagnetic ordering must be induced by magnetic fields in
cuprates that exhibit large magnetoresistance.

communities with common objectives. Within a community, data collections are
stored or replicated on distributed resources to enhance storage capability or
efficiency of access. In such an environment, scientists need to have the
ability to carry out their studies by transparently accessing distributed data
and computational resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a Grid
broker that mediates access to distributed resources by (a) discovering
suitable data sources for a given analysis scenario, (b) suitable computational
resources, (c) optimally mapping analysis jobs to resources, (d) deploying and
monitoring job execution on selected resources, (e) accessing data from local
or remote data source during job execution and (f) collating and presenting
results. The broker supports a declarative and dynamic parametric programming
model for creating grid applications. We have used this model in grid-enabling
a high energy physics analysis application (Belle Analysis Software Framework).
The broker has been used in deploying Belle experiment data analysis jobs on a
grid testbed, called Belle Analysis Data Grid, having resources distributed
across Australia interconnected through GrangeNet.

chromodynamics are extremely demanding. In the overlap framework, the
computation of the fermion propagator leads to a nested iteration where the
matrix vector multiplications in each step of an outer iteration have to be
accomplished by an inner iteration; the latter approximates the product of the
sign function of the hermitian Wilson fermion matrix with a vector. In this
paper we investigate aspects of this nested paradigm. We examine several Krylov
subspace methods to be used as an outer iteration for both propagator
computations and the Hybrid Monte-Carlo scheme. We establish criteria on the
accuracy of the inner iteration which allow to preserve an a priori given
precision for the overall computation. It will turn out that the accuracy of
the sign function can be relaxed as the outer iteration proceeds. Furthermore,
we consider preconditioning strategies, where the preconditioner is built upon
an inaccurate approximation to the sign function. Relaxation combined with
preconditioning allows for considerable savings in computational efforts up to
a factor of 4 as our numerical experiments illustrate. We also discuss the
possibility of projecting the squared overlap operator into one chiral sector.

nonzero chemical potentials. One issue discussed is the use of QCD inequalities
for this regime. In particular, the positivity of the integrand of particular
Euclidean space functional integrals for two-flavor QCD with degenerate quark
masses is used to demonstrate that the free energy per unit volume for QCD with
a baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ (and zero isospin chemical potential) is
necessarily greater than the free energy with isospin chemical potential $\mu_I
= \frac{2 \mu_B}{N_c} $ (and zero baryon chemical potential). This result may
be of use in model finite density systems. A corollary to this result is a
rigorous {\it ab initio} bound on the nucleon mass. The second major issue
addressed is the so-called ``Silver Blaze'' problem: the fact that at zero
temperature and chemical potentials less than some critical value the free
energy remains as that of the vacuum. This is puzzling in the context of a
functional integral since a chemical potential affects the functional
determinant of the Dirac operator and any nonzero $\mu$ changes every
eigenvalue of the Dirac operator compared to the $\mu=0$ value. The isospin
Silver Blaze problem is solved through the study of the spectrum of the
operator $\gamma_0 (\dslash + m)$. The status of the baryon Silver Blaze

in a frame of the quasiclassical operator method which appears to be a most
satisfactory approach to the problem. Under some quite generic assumptions the
general expression is derived for the probability of circularly polarized

The particular mechanism of radiation depends on interrelation between the
angle of incidence $\vartheta_0$ (angle between the momentum of initial
electron and axis (plane) of crystal) and angle $\vartheta_v \equiv V_0/m$
($V_0$ is the scale of a potential of axis or a plane relative to which the
angle $\vartheta_0$ is defined). When $\vartheta_0 \ll \vartheta_v$ one has
magnetic bremsstrahlung type of radiation (with corrections $\propto
\vartheta_0^2$ which are due to inhomogeneous character of field in crystal).
When $\vartheta_0 \gg \vartheta_v$ one obtains the theory of coherent
bremsstrahlung, while for $\vartheta_0 \geq \vartheta_v$ one arrives to the
modified theory of coherent bremsstrahlung. At high energy radiation in
oriented crystals is strongly enhanced comparing with standard bremsstrahlung.

depending on the moduli is obtained by appealing to the underlying S-duality

the origin of the algebra is primarily due to high degree of degeneracies in

mixed moving averages related to dissipative flows have been studied, as well
as processes associated with identity flows which are the simplest type of
conservative flows. The focus here is on self-similar stable mixed moving
averages related to periodic and cyclic flows. Periodic flows are conservative
flows such that each point in the space comes back to its initial position in
finite time, either positive or null. The flow is cyclic if the return time is
positive.
  Self-similar mixed moving averages are called periodic, respectively cyclic,
fractional stable motions if their minimal representations are generated by
periodic, respectively cyclic, flows. These processes, however, are often
defined by a nonminimal representation. We provide a way to detect whether they
are periodic or cyclic even if their representation is nonminimal. By using
these identification results, we obtain a more refined decomposition of

expands towards a dilute configuration from which it may recontract or evolve
into a bubble-like structure. Then fragments are formed through the development
of volume and/or surface instabilities. The two possibilities co-exist at 32
MeV/A, leading to quite different fragment partitions, while at 50 MeV/A the
hollow configuration is observed in all events. Large variances are recovered
in a way fully consistent with the presence of spinodal decomposition remnants.
Kinematical properties of fragments are discussed and suggested as observables
very sensitive to the dominant fragment production mechanism. A larger radial

paper was to find results which would be convenient for computing the intrabeam
scattering growth rates for particle distributions which are more complicated
than a simple gaussian. It was shown by A. Piwinski that beam growth rates due
to intrabeam scattering can be expressed as a multidimensional integral [1]. It
was pointed out by J. Bjorken and S. Mtingwa [2] that the reduction of the
multidimensional integral to a 3-dimensional untegral is made easier by writing
the integral so that its relativistic transformation properties are more
obvious. The starting point in [2] was a result from the treatment of the two
body scattering problem in relativistic quantum theory . In this paper the
starting point is the relativistic transformation properties of the scattering
cross section which may be a more familiar starting point. The resulting
expression for the multidimensional integral is simpler to reduce. In addition,
the results do not depend on the particular form of the Coulomb cross section
that was used in [2] and are valid for any collision cross section.

scattering, then they are elementary; otherwise, they are combined; each
combined process consists from several alternative elementary ones to proceed
simultaneously; the corresponding (normed) state can be uniquely presented as
the sum of elementary ones whose (constant) norms give unit, in sum; Born's
formula intended for calculating the {\it expectation} values of physical
observables, as well as the standard timing procedure are valid only for
elementary states and processes; only an elementary time-dependent state can be

elementary ones, transmission and reflection. In the standard setting of the
