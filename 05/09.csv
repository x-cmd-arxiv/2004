function of the giants is determined using parallaxes from the Hipparcos
satellite; for more distant giants, observed in a cone at the South Galactic
Pole, distances are determined using intermediate band DDO photometry (which
has been calibrated to the Hipparcos absolute magnitudes). From this sample, we
determine the gravitational potential vertically of the local Galactic disc, by
comparing the number of giant stars observed in the cone with the number
expected for various models of the matter distribution in the disc. We derive
an estimate of the dynamical disc mass surface density of 56 +/- 6 solar masses
/pc^2, which may be compared to an estimate of 53 solar masses/pc^2 in visible
matter. For all gravitating matter (disc + dark halo) we find the total density
within 1.1 kpc of the disc midplane to be 74 +/- 6 solar masses/pc^2. As has
been found by a number of studies, including our own, we find no compelling
evidence for significant amounts of dark matter in the disc.

results show that the spectral index alpha (F_{nu} propto nu^alpha) of the PWN
is flat, or even marginally positive, with a value of
alpha_{8.4}^{31}=0.10+-0.06, while the Vela X filamentary structure has a
negative spectral index of alpha_{8.4}^{31}=-0.28+-0.09. The SED inhomogeneity
observed in Vela X suggests different excitation processes between the PWN and
the filaments. We investigate whether the PWN's flat spectrum is a consequence
of variability or truly reflects the SED of the object. The peak of the PWN at
31 GHz is 80''+-20'' south-west of the peak at 8.4 GHz. This shift is confirmed

sample of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are estimated by some
different methods to test their theoretical models. Apart from the methods
using the H$\beta$ linewidth and the [O III] linewidth, soft X-ray excess as a
prominent character of NLS1s is used to estimate the black hole masses. The
virial mass derived from the H$\beta$ linewidth assuming random orbits of
broad-line reigns (BLRs) is consistent with that from the soft X-ray bump
luminosity for NLS1s but with a larger scatter. The virial black hole masses
showed that most of NLS1s are in the super-Eddington accretion state while most
of broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1s) are not. We found that the black hole
mass estimated from [O III] linewidth is not in agreement with above two
methods. Using the Eddington limit relation for the super-Eddington accretion
suggested by Wang (2004), we found that there are 16 NLS1s satisfied with this
Eddington limit relation. The masses of these 16 NLS1s derived from X-ray
luminosity are systematically larger than that from H$\beta$ linewidth assuming
random BLRs orbits. If the mass derived from X-ray luminosity is true, the mean
disk inclination to the line of sight in these 16 NLS1s is about $17^{\circ}$,

two cones extending to ~1,100 AU within an opening angle of ~30deg, imbedded in
a wind with the standard r^{-2} density profile. The cocoon expansion started
<~200 years ago, while the total lifetime of the circumstellar shell is ~5,500

recently observed in a number of other AGB stars, culminating in jet breakout
from the confining spherical wind. The bipolar outflow is triggered at a late
stage in the evolution of AGB winds, and IRC+10011 provides its earliest
example thus far. These new developments enable us to identify the first

[(\rho, \omega) \gamma/K^* \gamma] = (3.3 \pm 1.0)%$, in agreement with the
BELLE data. Leaving instead the CKM-Wolfenstein parameters free, our analysis
gives (at 68% C.L.) $0.16\leq |V_{td}/V_{ts}| \leq 0.29$, which is in agreement
with but less precise than the indirect CKM-unitarity fit of the same, $0.18
\leq |V_{td}/V_{ts}| \leq 0.22$. The isospin-violating ratio in the $B \to \rho
\gamma$ decays and the SU(3)-violating ratio in the $B_d^0 \to (\rho^0, \omega)
\gamma$ decays are presented together with estimates of the direct and
mixing-induced CP-asymmetries in the $B \to (\rho,\omega) \gamma$ decays within
the SM. Their measurements will overconstrain the angle $\alpha$ of the
CKM-unitarity triangle.

result supports the identification of ``dual quarks'' found at $r$-vacua of

algebraic invariants. Algebraic regularities are often preserved when the
geometrical figure is topologically deformed. The most natural, intuitively
simple but mathematically complicated, topological objects are Knots.
  We present in this papers several examples, both old and new, of regularity
of algebraic invariants of knots. Our main invariants are the Jones polynomial
(1984) and its generalizations.
  In the first section, we discuss the concept of a symmetric knot, and give
one important example -- a torus knot. In the second section, we give review of
the Jones type invariants. In the third section, we gently and precisely
develop the periodicity criteria from the Kauffman bracket (ingenious version
of the Jones polynomial). In the fourth section, we extend the criteria to
skein (Homflypt) and Kauffman polynomials. In the fifth section we describe r^q
periodicity criteria using Vassiliev-Gusarov invariants. We also show how the
skein method may be used for r^q periodicity criteria for the classical (1928)
Alexander polynomial. In the sixth section, we introduce the notion of
Lissajous and billiard knots and show how symmetry principles can be applied to
these geometric knots. Finally, in the seventh section, we show how symmetry
can be used to gain nontrivial information about knots in other 3-manifolds,
and how symmetry of 3-manifolds is reflected in manifold invariants. In
particular, we find the formula for a torus knot in a solid torus and we show
that the third eigenvector (e_3) of the Kauffman bracket skein module of the
solid torus (with respect to the meridian Dehn twist) can be realized by a link
in a solid torus.

series of resonances (to be termed ""mega states"") to internal baryon structure
dominated by a quark -(rigid di-quark) configuration. Nucleon and Delta spectra
are, surprisingly enough, exact replicas to each other in the sense that each
of them features three mega states of equal quantum numbers. We fit positions
and splittings of the observed mega states by an algebraic Hamiltonian which
translates into a potential that is a combination of Coulomb- and Morse like
potentials and predict few more such degenerate series to be observed by the
TJNAF missing resonance program. Finally, we explore consequences of the model
for some electrodynamic properties of the spectra.
