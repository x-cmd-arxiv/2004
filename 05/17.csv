dwarf spheroidal galaxy. From spectral synthesis in LTE we derive a lithium
abundance of log e(Li)=3.5+/-0.4 and a C/O ratio between 3 and 5. This is the
first detection of a lithium rich C-star in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Basing
on stellar models of appropriate chemical composition, we show that a similar C
enrichment is compatible with that expectedfor a low mass low metallicity
thermally pulsing AGB star, undergoing few third dredge up episodes. The
position in the log g-log Teff diagram of D461 is also compatible with this
theoretical scenario. In particular, the low effective temperature, lower than
that expected for a low metallicity giant star, is a consequence of the huge
increase of the envelope opacity occurring after the carbon dredge up. The Li
enrichment may be explained if a deep circulation would take place during the
interpulse period, the so called cool bottom process. In spite of the low
resolution of our spectra, we derive a lower limit for the carbon isotopic
ratio, namely 12C/13C>40, and a constraint for the Ba abundance, namely
0.5<[Ba/Fe]< 2. The proposed scenario also fits these further constraints.
Then, we estimate that the mass of D461 ranges between 1.2 and 2 $M_\odot$,
which corresponds to an age ranging between 1 and 3 Gyr. We conclude that this
star is more massive and younger than the typical stellar population of Draco.

corresponds to that of typical Seyferts, but the ionized regions are not
distributed in a homogeneous way around the QSO, and are located preferentially
several kiloparsecs away from it. While the stellar absorption lines do not
show any significant velocity field, the gas emission lines do. The observed
gas velocity field is hard to reconcile with dynamical models involving
rotating disk, modified Hubble laws or power laws, that all require extreme
central masses (M > 10^9 M_sun) to provide only poor fit to the data. Power law
models, which best fit the data, provide a total mass of M(< 10 kpc)=9.2 10^10

instability-generated structure in winds of hot stars out to very large
distances (more than 1000 stellar radii). This technique makes use of our
previous finding that external forces play little role in the outer evolution
of structure. Rather than evolving the entire wind, as is traditionally done,
the technique focuses on a representative portion of the structure and follows
it as it moves out with the flow. This requires the problem to be formulated in
a moving reference frame. The lack of Galilean invariance of the spherical
equations of hydrodynamics is circumvented by recasting them in a pseudo-planar
form. By applying the technique to a number of problems we show that it is fast
and accurate, and has considerable conceptual advantages. It is particularly
useful to test the dependence of solutions on the Galilean frame in which they
were obtained. As an illustration, we show that, in a one-dimensional
approximation, the wind can remain structured out to distances of more than
1300 stellar radii from the central star.

extent of the 1667 MHz line overshoots that of the 1612 MHz line in about 80%
of the targets. 52% and 26% of the 1612 and 1667 MHz sources, respectively,
show linear polarization in at least some features. Circular polarization is
more frequent, occurring in 78% and 32% of sources of the respective OH lines.
The percentage polarization is usually small (<15%) reaching up to 50-80% in a
few sources. Features of linearly polarized emission are usually weak (0.5-4Jy)
and narrow (0.3-0.5kms^{-1}). The strength of magnetic field inferred from
likely Zeeman pairs in two sources of a few mG is consistent with values
reported elsewhere for those classes of objects. An upper limit of the electron
density in the envelope of OH17.7-2.0 derived from the difference in the
position angle of polarization vectors for the two OH lines is about 1cm^{-3}.
Distinct profiles of polarization position angle at 1612 and 1667 MHz are seen
in about one third of the sources and strongly suggest that the envelopes are
permeated with structured magnetic fields. The geometry of the magnetic field
is implicated as an important cause of the depolarization found in some PPN
candidates. For the subset of targets which show axisymmetric shells in the
optical or radio images we found a dominance of magnetic field components which
are orthogonal to the long axis of the nebulae. This finding supports the
hypothesis that such bipolar lobes are shaped by the magnetic field.

this SED model, we predict colour, magnitude, and size of present-day
descendants of submm galaxies, and derive scaling relations, such as the
present-day colour-magnitude and size-magnitude relations. We argue that submm
galaxies are the progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies, provided that
the initial mass function (IMF) of submm galaxies is slightly flatter than the
Salpeter IMF. In this case, we find that 1) the mean present-day magnitude of
submm galaxies is similar to that of L* elliptical galaxies, 2) the present-day
colour-magnitude relation is consistent with that of elliptical galaxies, 3)
the present-day size-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies can be
reproduced if massive submm galaxies consist of multiple starburst regions. We
estimate the effect of feedback in submm galaxies as a function of starburst
age. It is found that starburst regions in submm galaxies are likely to be
self-regulated; i.e. the effect of feedback is nearly balanced with the
self-gravity of starburst regions.

orders of magnitude to higher luminosities. Its shape is very similar to that
of the local luminosity function of field galaxies, but the space density is
about 3000 times higher. When extrapolated to 30 GHz, our luminosity function
compares very favourably with an estimate obtained directly from the 30 GHz
observations by Cooray et al. (1998). The antenna temperature contributed by
radio sources within the nominal cluster radius of 1.7 Mpc is estimated to be
\~13.5 microK at 30 GHz for clusters at z~0 and decreases to ~3.4 microK at

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of alkali metal gas, in that it does not involve
rotation: BEC is trapped in a quadrupole field with a uniform bias field which
is reversed adiabatically leading to vortex formation at the center of the
magnetic trap. The scenario has been experimentally verified by MIT group
employing $^{23}$Na atoms. Recently similar experiments have been conducted at
Kyoto University, in which BEC of $^{87}$Rb atoms has been used. In the latter
experiments they found that the fine-tuning of the field reverse time $T_{\rm
rev}$ is required to achieve stable vortex formation. Otherwise, they often
observed vortex fragmentations or a condensate without a vortex. It is shown in
this paper that this behavior is attributed to the heavy mass of the Rb atom.
The confining potential, which depends on the eigenvalue $m_B$ of the hyperfine
spin $\bv{F}$ along the magnetic field, is now shifted by the gravitational
field perpendicular to the vortex line. Then the positions of two
weak-field-seeking states with $m_B=1$ and 2 deviate from each other. This
effect is more prominent for BEC with a heavy atomic mass, for which the
deviation is greater and, moreover, the Thomas-Fermi radius is smaller. We
found, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically, that two
condensates interact in a very complicated way leading to fragmentation of
vortices, unless $T_{\rm rev}$ is properly tuned.

(loosely bound, LB) soliton state, based on a 2D Bloch function near the edge
of the Brillouin zone (BZ), has a negative effective mass (while the mass of a
localized state is positive near the BZ center). The negative-mass soliton
cannot be held by the usual trap, but it is safely confined by an inverted
parabolic potential (anti-trap). Direct simulations demonstrate that the LB
solitons (including the ones with intrinsic vorticity) are stable and can
freely move on top of the OL. The frequency of elliptic motion of the
LB-soliton's center in the anti-trapping potential is very close to the
analytical prediction which treats the solition as a quasi-particle. In
addition, the LB soliton of the vortex type features real rotation around its
center. We also find an abrupt transition, which occurs with the increase of
the number of atoms, from the negative-mass LB states to tightly bound (TB)
solitons. An estimate demonstrates that, for the zero-vorticity states, the
transition occurs when the number of atoms attains a critical number N=10^3,
while for the vortex the transition takes place at N=5x10^3 atoms. The
positive-mass LB states constructed near the BZ center (including vortices) can
move freely too. The effects predicted for BECs also apply to optical spatial
solitons in bulk photonic crystals.

considerations in order to study the conformations and the effective
interactions between weakly charged, flexible polyelectrolyte chains in
salt-free conditions. We focus on charging fractions lying below 20%, for which
case there is no Manning condensation of counterions and the latter can be thus
partitioned in two states: those that are trapped within the region of the
flexible chain and the ones that are free in the solution. We examine the
partition of counterions in these two states, the chain sizes and the monomer
distributions for various chain lengths, finding that the monomer density
follows a Gaussian shape. We calculate the effective interaction between the
centers of mass of two interacting chains, under the assumption that the chains
can be modeled as two overlapping Gaussian charge profiles. The analytical
calculations are compared with measurements from Molecular Dynamics
simulations. Good quantitative agreement is found for charging fractions below
10%, where the chains assume coil-like configurations, whereas deviations
develop for charge fraction of 20%, in which case a conformational transition
of the chain towards a rodlike configuration starts to take place.

are modeled by a spatial game and the network of interaction links evolves
adapting to the outcome of the game. As an example we consider a model of
cooperation, where the adaptation is shown to facilitate the formation of a
hierarchical interaction network that sustains a highly cooperative stationary
state. The resulting network has the characteristics of a small world network
when a mechanism of local neighbor selection is introduced in the adaptive
network dynamics. The highly connected nodes in the hierarchical structure of
the network play a leading role in the stability of the network. Perturbations
acting on the state of these special nodes trigger global avalanches leading to
complete network reorganization.

that in first approximation black-hole entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity depends
linearly on the area, with small correction terms which have logarithmic or

of terms that depend linearly on the Planck length, but we observe that this

discrete spacetime structure and a minimal length: under Lorentz contraction, a
Planck length ruler would be seen as smaller by a boosted observer. We argue
that in the context of quantum gravity, the distance between two points becomes
an operator and show through a toy model, inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity,
that the notion of a quantum of geometry and of discrete spectra of geometric
operators, is not inconsistent with Lorentz invariance. The main feature of the
model is that a state of definite length for a given observer turns into a
superposition of eigenstates of the length operator when seen by a boosted
observer. More generally, we discuss the issue of actually measuring distances
taking into account the limitations imposed by quantum gravity considerations
and we analyze the notion of distance and the phenomenon of Lorentz contraction
in the framework of ``deformed (or doubly) special relativity'' (DSR), which
tentatively provides an effective description of quantum gravity around a flat
background. In order to do this we study the Hilbert space structure of DSR,
and study various quantum geometric operators acting on it and analyze their
spectral properties. We also discuss the notion of spacetime point in DSR in
terms of coherent states. We show how the way Lorentz invariance is preserved

by a x polarized GW, whereas the slow and fast magneto-acoustic modes couple to
the + polarization. The slow mode, however, doesn't interact coherently with
the GW. The most relevant wave mode is the fast magneto-acoustic mode which in
a strongly magnetized plasma has a vanishingly small phase lag with respect to
the GW allowing for coherent interaction over large length scales. When the

accurate estimate of the entropy. The solution also describes a quantized

case of Dirac fermions the spectrum of the number operator shifts by 1/2. In
the case of majorana fermions it becomes useful to assign negative values of
fermion number to a finite number of states occupying the zero-energy level,
constituting a \textit{majorana pond}. We determine the parities of these

with a full conformal field theory (CFT) definition, discovered over a decade
ago as a heterotic coset model. Having a CFT definition makes this an excellent
laboratory for the study of the stringy fate of CTCs, the Taub cosmology, and
the Milne/Misner-type chronology horizon which separates them. In an effort to
uncover the role of stringy corrections to such geometries, we calculate the

features of Taub-NUT persist in the exact theory, together with the emergence
of a region of space with Euclidean signature bounded by time-like curvature
singularities. Although such remarks are premature, their persistence in the
exact geometry is suggestive that string theory theory is able to make physical
sense of the Milne/Misner singularities and the CTCs, despite their
pathological character in General Relativity. This may also support the
possibility that CTCs may be viable in some physical situations, and may be a
natural ingredient in pre-Big-Bang cosmological scenarios.

spread-out oriented percolation incipient infinite cluster above 4 dimensions
and of incipient infinite branching random walk in any dimension. We conjecture
that it also arises as the scaling limit in various other models above the
upper-critical dimension, such as the incipient infinite lattice tree above 8
dimensions, the incipient infinite cluster for unoriented percolation, uniform
spanning trees above 4 dimensions, and invasion percolation above 6 dimensions.
This paper also serves as a survey of recent results linking super-Brownian to
scaling limits in statistical mechanics.

waveforms according to the identity of the neurons that generated them.
Existing techniques perform this classification ignoring several properties of
actual neurons that can ultimately improve classification performance. In this
chapter, after illustrating the spike-sorting problem with real data, we
propose a more realistic spike train generation model. It incorporates both a
description of ""non trivial"" (ie, non Poisson) neuronal discharge statistics
and a description of spike waveform dynamics (eg, the events amplitude decays
for short inter-spike intervals). We show that this spike train generation
model is analogous to a one-dimensional Potts spin glass model. We can
therefore use the computational methods which have been developed in fields
where Potts models are extensively used. These methods are based on the
construction of a Markov Chain in the space of model parameters and spike train
configurations, where a configuration is defined by specifying a neuron of
origin for each spike. This Markov Chain is built such that its unique
stationary density is the posterior density of model parameters and
configurations given the observed data. A Monte Carlo simulation of the Markov
Chain is then used to estimate the posterior density. The theoretical
background on Markov chains is provided and the way to build the transition
matrix of the Markov Chain is illustrated with a simple, but realistic, model
for data generation . Simulated data are used to illustrate the performance of
the method and to show that it can easily cope with neurons generating spikes
