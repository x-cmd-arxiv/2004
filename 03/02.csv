quadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with L*(z)~10^(1.39z-0.29z^2).

10^10 < M/Msun < 10^12. We derive K-band mass-to-light ratios by fitting a grid
of composite stellar population models of varying star formation history, age,
and dust extinction to BVRIJK photometry. We discuss the evolution of the
average mass-to-light ratio as a function of galaxy stellar mass in the K-band
and in the B-band. We compare our stellar mass function at z > 0 to estimates
obtained similarly at z=0. We find that the mass-to-light ratios in the K-band
decline with redshift. This decline is similar for all stellar masses above
$10^10 Msun. Lower mass galaxies have lower mass-to-light ratios at all
redshifts. The stellar mass function evolves significantly to z = 1.2. The
total normalization decreases by a factor of ~2, the characteristic mass (the
knee) shifts towards lower masses and the bright end therefore steepens with
redshift. The amount of number density evolution is a strong function of
stellar mass, with more massive systems showing faster evolution than less
massive systems. We discuss the total stellar mass density of the universe and
compare our results to the values from the literature both at lower and higher
redshift. We find that the stellar mass density at z~1 is roughly 50% of the
local value. Our results imply that the mass assembly of galaxies continues
well after $z \sim 1$. Our data favor a scenario in which the growth of the
most massive galaxies is dominated by accretion and merging rather than star
formation which plays a larger role in the growth of less massive systems.

Mosquera Cuesta & Salim (2003) presented the first astrophysical study where
such nonlinear electrodynamics (NLEDs) effects were accounted for in the case
of a highly magnetized neutron star or pulsar. In that paper the NLEDs was
invoked {\it a l\`a} Euler-Heisenberg, which is an infinite series expansion of
which only the first term was used for the analisys. The immediate consequence
of that study was an overall modification of the space-time geometry around the
pulsar, which is ``perceived'', in principle, only by light propagating out of
the star. This translates into an significant change in the surface redshift,
as inferred from absorption (emission) lines observed from a super magnetized
pulsar. The result proves to be even more dramatic for the so-called magnetars,
pulsars endowed with magnetic ($B$) fields higher then the Schafroth quantum
electrodynamics critical $B$-field. Here we demonstrate that the same effect
still appears if one calls for the NLEDs in the form of the one rigorously
derived by Born & Infeld (1934) based on the special relativistic limit for the
velocity of approaching of an elementary particle to a pointlike electron [From

Earth masses of iron) in five cases of warm stars. This latter limit is similar
to the estimates of rocky material accreted by the Sun during its main sequence
lifetime. Combining the results of the present analysis with those for the
Hyades and Pleiades, we conclude that the hypothesis that pollution by
planetary material is the only responsible for the highest metallicity of the
stars with planets may be rejected at more than 99% level of confidence if the
incidence of planets in these samples is as high as 8% and similar to the field
stars included in current radial velocity surveys. However, the significance of
this result drops considerably if the incidence of planets around stars in
binary systems and clusters is less than a half than around normal field stars.

which give 39.8 kHz and a line strength ratio of 3:1. We improve the

Potentially high optical depths (3 to 5 in L1512) in quiescent clouds require
to consider the line's doublet nature when comparing to other molecular
species, possibly reversing previous conclusions from single-component
interpretations. We further confirm the hyperfine splitting in the ^{13}CO(1-0)
transition that had been predicted, and measured in the laboratory, to be about
46 kHz. By applying hyperfine analysis to the data set of the first IRAM
key-project we show that ^{13}CO optical depths can be estimated in narrow
linewidth regions without recourse to other transitions nor to assumptions on
beam filling factors, and linewidth and velocity determinations can be
improved. For the core of L1512 we find an inverse proportionality between
linewidth and column density resp. square root of optical depth, and a
systematic inside-out increase of excitation temperature and of the

extreme large-scale cosmological structure (around 200 Mpc) over the redshift

underdensities do exist and hence represent the detection of cosmological
fluctuations on comoving scales that correspond to those presently detected in
the cosmic microwave background. However, the fractional overdensities on
scales >100Mpc are in the linear or only weakly non-linear regime and do not
represent collapsed non-linear structures. We compare the measurements with the
expectation of a standard LCDM model by measuring the variance of counts in
cells and find that, provided the distribution of QSOs on large scales exhibits
a mild bias with respect to the distribution of dark matter, the observed
fluctuations are found to be in good agreement with the model. There is no
evidence on such scales for any extreme structures that might require, for
example, departures from the assumption of Gaussian initial perturbations. Thus
the power-spectrum derived from the 2QZ Survey appears to provide a complete
description of the distribution of QSOs. The amount of bias and its redshift
dependence that is required is consistent with that found from studying the
clustering of 2QZ QSOs on 10 Mpc scales, and may be adequately described by an
approximately redshift-invariant power spectrum with normalisation sigma_8=1.0

examined using the generating functional (path integral) approach of disordered

described by a constrained multi-component random field Ising model whose
ferromagnetic phase describes the emergence of a strong transitive majority. We
derive the phase diagram, which is characterized by a tri-critical point and
show that, contrary to intuition, it may be more likely for an interacting
population to reach consensus on a number S of alternatives when S increases.
This effect is due to the constraint imposed by transitivity on voting
behavior. Indeed if agents are allowed to express non transitive votes, the
agents' interaction may decrease considerably the probability of a transitive

to result from two fundamental mechanisms, trade and investment. An empirical
distribution of wealth shows an abrupt change between the low-medium range,
that may be fitted by a non-monotonic function with an exponential-like tail
such as a Gamma distribution, and the high wealth range, that is well fitted by
a Pareto or inverse power-law function. We demonstrate that an appropriate
trade-investment model, depending on three adjustable parameters associated
with the total wealth of a society, a social differentiation among agents, and
economic volatility referred to as investment can successfully reproduce the
distribution of empirical wealth data in the low, medium and high ranges.
Finally, we provide an economic interpretation of the mechanisms in the model
and, in particular, we discuss the difference between Classical and
Neoclassical theories regarding the concepts of {\it value} and {\it price}. We
consider the importance that out-of-equilibrium trade transactions, where the
prices differ from values, have in real economic societies.

The CEF parameters, energy level splittings, and wavefunctions are tabulated
for each member of the CeMIn5 series and compared to each other as well as to
the results of previous measurements. Our results indicate that the CEF level
splitting in all three materials is similar, and can be thought of as being
derived from the cubic parent compound CeIn3 in which an excited state quartet
at ~12 meV is split into two doublets by the lower symmetry of the tetragonal
environment of the CeMIn5 materials. In each case, the CEF excitations are
observed as broad lines in the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum. We
attribute this broadening to Kondo hybridization of the localized f moments
with the conduction electrons. The evolution of the superconducting transition
temperatures in the different members of CeMIn5 can then be understood as a
direct consequence of the strength of this hybridization. Due to the importance
of Kondo spin fluctuations in these materials, we also present calculations

Firstly, a mean-field steady state mapping is generalized to the disordered
case, where it provides a mapping of probability distributions and demonstrates
how disorder results in a new flat regime in the steady state current--density
plot for periodic boundary conditions. This effect was earlier observed by
Tripathy and Barma but we provide treatment for more general distributions of
disorder, including both numerical results and analytic expressions for the
width $2\Delta_C$ of the flat section. We then apply an argument based on
moving shock fronts to show how this leads to an increase in the high current
region of the phase diagram for open boundary conditions. Secondly, we show how
equivalent results can be obtained easily by taking the continuum limit of the
problem and then using a disordered version of the well-known Cole--Hopf
mapping to linearize the equation. Within this approach we show that adding
disorder induces a localization transformation (verified by numerical scaling),
and $\Delta_C$ maps to an inverse localization length, helping to give a new
physical interpretation to the problem.

proposed approach to understanding the origin of power-law distributions in
stock price fluctuations. First, we extend our previous analysis to 1000 US
stocks and perform a new estimation of market impact that accounts for
splitting of large orders and potential autocorrelations in the trade flow. Our
new analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a
square-root functional form of market impact for large volumes, in contrast to
the claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller
exponent. Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller
size trades, procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law
exponent. Second, FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, and
solely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do
not have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange. We perform new
empirical analysis on transaction data for the 262 largest stocks listed in the
London Stock Exchange, and find that the distribution of volume decays as a
power-law with an exponent $\approx 3/2$ -- in sharp contrast to FL's claim
that the distribution of transaction volume does not have a power-law tail. Our
exponent estimate of $\approx 3/2$ is consistent with our previous results from
the New York and Paris Stock Exchanges. We conclude that the available
empirical evidence is consistent with our hypothesis on the origin of power-law
fluctuations in stock prices.

world which have similar property to this model, we consider those of personal
income in Japan over latest twenty fiscal years. We find relations between the
typical scale and several kinds of averages in this model, and observe that
these relations are also valid in recent personal income distributions in Japan
with sufficient accuracy. We show the existence of the fiscal years so called
bubble term in which the gap has arisen in power law, by observing that the
data are away from one of these relations. We confirm, therefore, that the
distribution of this model has close similarity to those of personal income. In
addition, we can estimate the value of Pareto index and whether a big gap
exists in power law by using only these relations. As a result, we point out

that the distribution function derived in this model is an effective tool to

enhancement not only exists for $i=0$, but also for any exciton having a center
of mass momentum equal to the sea exciton momentum. This physically comes from
the fact that an exciton with such a momentum can be transformed into a sea
exciton by ``Pauli scattering'', \emph{i}. \emph{e}., carrier exchange with the
sea, making this $i$ exciton not so much different from a 0 exciton. This
possible scattering, directly linked to the composite nature of the excitons,

many-body effects linked to carrier exchange in an easy way. They are
conceptually different from Feynman diagrams, because of the special feature of
the ``Pauli scatterings'': These scatterings, which originate from the
departure from boson statistics, do not have their equivalent in Feynman

  We then study for how much these hypersurfaces can be deformed and discuss
then causality, namely what is the maximal propagation speed in any given

discuss two results for which the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems shows
to be insufficient. The first deals with the hyperbolicity analysis of systems
which are second order in space derivatives, they include certain versions of

  The second result deals with systems having constraints. The question posed
is which hyperbolicity properties, if any, are inherited from the original

including operators with support in the asymptotic future (or past). Similar
results hold in a family of topologically analogous flat spacetimes, where we
show the two vacua to be distinguished also by the shear stresses in the
zero-mass limit. As a by-product, we display the explicit Bogolubov
transformation between the Rindler-basis and the Minkowski-basis for massive
Dirac fermions in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

the gauge model with one universal extra dimension, within Higgs and Higgsless
scenarios. The stabilization occurs at the one-loop level, through the
fermionic contribution to the effective potential; in the Higgs case, for
stabilization to take place the bosonic contribution must be balanced by the
fermionic one, hence the scales of these two cannot differ too much. However,
there is no need for (softly broken) supersymmetry to achieve the stabilization
- it can be arranged for a reasonably wide range of couplings and mass scales.
The primary instability in the model is the run-away of the radion vacuum
expectation value. It turns out that the requirement of the radion stability,
in the Higgs case, favours a Higgs boson mass below 0.26 TeV, which is
consistent with the Standard Model upper bound that follows from the
electroweak precision measurements. The typical radion mass is of the order of
10^{-6} eV. The radion mass can be made larger by rising the scale of fermion
masses, as clearly seen in the Higgsless case. The cosmological constant may be
cancelled by suitable counterterms, in such a way that the stabilization is not
affected.

generations are theoretically allowed, and there are no restrictions from the
anomaly-matching on their couplings nor on their U(1)_{B-L} charge. Absence of
global anomalies for the composite sector as a whole does not preclude
anomalous triple gauge boson couplings arising from composite fermion
triangular diagrams. On the other hand, the trace of B-L over elementary
fermions must vanish if all Goldstone modes are to disappear from the spectrum.

Regge limit. We develop a new systematic procedure for this limit in
perturbative QCD to arbitrary logarithmic order. The formalism relies on the IR
structure and the gauge symmetry of the theory. Using a factorization procedure
introduced by Sen, we derive a sum of convolutions in transverse momentum space
over soft and jet functions, which approximate the amplitude up to
power-suppressed corrections. A set of evolution equations generalizing the
BFKL equation and controlling the high energy behavior of the amplitudes to
arbitrary logarithmic accuracy is derived. The general method is illustrated in
the case of leading and next-to-leading logarithmic gluon reggeization and BFKL
equation. We confirm the standard results at LL accuracy. At NLL order, we find
an agreement with the reggeization conjecture up to two loops. However,
starting at three loop order, we identify contributions violating the Regge
ansatz. In addition, we calculate the evolution kernel determining the
high-energy behavior of the non-reggeized term in the scattering amplitude. In
the second part, we focus our attention to another intriguing problem of
high-energy QCD, the resummation associated with soft radiation in dijet events
which is complicated by the presence of non-global logarithms. We introduce a
set of correlations between energy flow and event shapes that are sensitive to
the flow of color at short distances in jet events. The method is illustrated
for electron-positron dijet events. We calculate the correlation at leading

particles which are light at special points in moduli space. The resulting
forces trap the moduli at these points, which often exhibit enhanced symmetry.
Moduli trapping occurs in time-dependent quantum field theory, as well as in
systems of moving D-branes, where it leads the branes to combine into stacks.
Trapping also occurs in an expanding universe, though the range over which the
moduli can roll is limited by Hubble friction. We observe that a scalar field
trapped on a steep potential can induce a stage of acceleration of the
universe, which we call trapped inflation. Moduli trapping ameliorates the
cosmological moduli problem and may affect vacuum selection. In particular,
rolling moduli are most powerfully attracted to the points with the largest
number of light particles, which are often the points of greatest symmetry.
Given suitable assumptions about the dynamics of the very early universe, this
effect might help to explain why among the plethora of possible vacuum states
of string theory, we appear to live in one with a large number of light
particles and (spontaneously broken) symmetries. In other words, some of the
surprising properties of our world might arise not through pure chance or
miraculous cancellations, but through a natural selection mechanism during
dynamical evolution.

reformulated as the ordinary Maxwell theory with an additional special axion

non-trivial. Particularly, the pre-metric energy-momentum tensor does not
depend on the axion. This is in contrast to the CFJ energy-momentum tensor
which involves the axion addition explicitly. We show that the relation between
these two quantities is similar to the correspondence between the Noether
conserved tensor and the Hilbert symmetric tensor. As a result the CFJ
energy-momentum tensor appears as the unique conserved closure of the
pre-metric one. Another problem is in the description of the birefringence
effect, which in the pre-metric framework does not depend on the axion. The
comparison with the CFJ model shows that the corresponding wave propagation
(Fresnel) equation has to be extended by a derivative term, which is non zero
for the axion field. In this way, the CFJ birefringence effect is derived in
the metric-free approach. Consequently the Lorentz and CPT violating models can
be embedded without contradictions in the pre-metric approach to
electrodynamics. This correspondence can be useful for both constructions.

orthogonal to the NC plane. This is the first example of a nonlocal theory in

unitarity constraint on the partial-wave amplitudes, which could be used in
this case. High-energy upper bounds on the total cross-section, among others,
are also obtained for an arbitrary flat (noncompact) dimension of NC

$G_t(z)=z+tN_t(z)$. (Note that $G_{t=1}(z)=G(z)$ when $o(H(z))\geq 2$.) We show
that $N_t(z)$ is the unique power series solution of a Cauchy problem of a PDE,
from which we derive a recurrent formula for $G_t(z)$. Secondly, motivated by

$F(z)=z-H(z)$ satisfying the gradient condition, i.e. $H(z)=\nabla P(z)$ for

the PDE satisfied by $N_t(z)$ becomes the $n$-dimensional inviscid Burgers'

Furthermore, we clarify some close relationships among the inversion problem,
Legendre transform and the inviscid Burgers' equations. In particular the
Jacobian conjecture is reduced to a problem on the inviscid Burgers' equations.

quotient $A$ of a given graded algebra $R/\fc$, whose Hilbert function is
maximal among such quotients with the given socle degrees. For us $\fc$ is
usually a ``general'' complete intersection and we usually require that $A$ be
level. The precise value of the Hilbert function of a relatively compressed
algebra is open, and we show that finding this value is equivalent to the
Fr\""oberg Conjecture. We then turn to the minimal free resolution of a level
algebra relatively compressed with respect to a general complete intersection.
When the algebra is Gorenstein of even socle degree we give the precise
resolution. When it is of odd socle degree we give good bounds on the graded
Betti numbers. We also relate this case to the Minimal Resolution Conjecture of
Mustata for points on a projective variety. Finding the graded Betti numbers is
essentially equivalent to determining to what extent there can be redundant
summands (i.e. ``ghost terms'') in the minimal free resolution, i.e. when
copies of the same $R(-t)$ can occur in two consecutive free modules. This is
easy to arrange using Koszul syzygies; we show that it can also occur in more
surprising situations that are not Koszul. Using the equivalence to the
Fr\""oberg Conjecture, we show that in a polynomial ring where that conjecture
holds (e.g. in three variables), the possible non-Koszul ghost terms are
extremely limited. Finally, we use the connection to the Fr\""oberg Conjecture,
as well as the calculation of the minimal free resolution for relatively
compressed Gorenstein algebras, to find the minimal free resolution of general
Artinian almost complete intersections in many new cases. This greatly extends
previous work of the first two authors.

built. Each charge collecting pad, hexagonally shaped, realized using the top
metal layer of a deep submicron VLSI technology is individually connected to a
full electronics chain (pre-amplifier, shaping-amplifier, sample and hold,
multiplexer) which is built immediately below it by using the remaining five
active layers. The GEM and the drift electrode window are assembled directly
over the chip so the ASIC itself becomes the pixelized anode of a MicroPattern
Gas Detector. With this approach, for the first time, gas detectors have
reached the level of integration and resolution typical of solid state pixel
detectors. Results from the first tests of this new read-out concept are
presented. An Astronomical X-Ray Polarimetry application is also discussed.

sequences obtained from human genome data. We confirm the existence of
threshold forces, already found in Fibonacci sequences, and of stop positions
highly dependent on the specific sequence. Another relevant conclusion is that
the effective potential, a collective coordinate formalism introduced by
Salerno and Kivshar [Phys. Lett. A {\bf 193}, 263 (1994)] is a useful tool to
identify key regions that control the behaviour of a larger sequence. We then
study how the fluctuations can assist the propagation process by helping the
excitations to escape the stop positions. Our conclusions point out to
improvements of the model which look promising to describe mechanical
denaturation of DNA. Finally, we also consider how randomly distributed energy
focus on the chain as a function of the sequence.

quantum mechanics arise from a non-commutative framework for calculus and
differential geometry. Discrete calculus is seen to fit into this pattern by
reformulating it in terms of commutators. Differential geometry begins here,
not with the concept of parallel translation, but with the concept of a
physical trajectory and the algebra related to the Jacobi identity that governs
that trajectory. The paper discusses how Poisson brackets give rise to Jacobi
identity, and how Jacobi identity arises in combinatorial contexts, including
graph coloring and knot theory.
  The paper gives a highly sharpened derivation of results of Tanimura on the
consequences of commutators that generalize the Feynman-Dyson derivation of
electromagnetism, and a generalization of the original Feynman-Dyson result
that makes no assumptions about commutators. The latter result is a consequence
of the definitions of the derivations in a particular non-commutative world.
Our generalized version of electromagnetism sheds light on the orginal
Feynman-Dyson derivation, and has many discrete models.
