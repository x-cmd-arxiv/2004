interesting and least studied GRB phases. During this phase the relativistic
ejecta begins interacting with the surrounding matter. A strong short lived
reverse shock propagates into the ejecta (provided that it is baryonic) while
the forward shock begins to shape the surrounding matter into a Blandford-McKee
profile. We suggest a parametrization of the early afterglow light curve and we
calculate (analytically and numerically) the observed parameters that results
from a reverse shock emission (in an interstellar medium [ISM] environment). We
present a new fingerprint of the reverse shock emission that is added to the
well known $t^{-2}$ optical decay. Observation of this signature would indicate
that the reverse shock dominates the emission during the early afterglow. The
existence of a reverse shock will in turn imply that the relativistic ejecta
contains a significant baryonic component. This signature would also imply that
the surrounding medium is an ISM. We further show that: (i) The reverse shock
optical flash depends strongly on initial conditions of the relativistic
ejecta. (ii) Previous calculations have generally overestimated the strength of
this optical flash. (iii) If the reverse shock dominates the optical flash then
detailed observations of the early afterglow light curve would possibly enable
us to determine the initial physical conditions within the relativistic ejecta
and specifically to estimate its Lorentz factor and its width.

  unveiling the disc structure",,,"10.1051/0004-6361:20040448",,"astro-ph",,"  Isolated HAEBE stars are believed to represent an intermediate stage of
objects between young stellar objects surrounded by massive, optically thick,
gaseous and dusty disks and Vega like stars surrounded by debris disks. The
star AB Aur is already known for being surrounded by an intermediate-stage dust
disk emitting a fairly large infrared and (sub-)millimetric excess. Until now,
the outer disk structure has only been resolved at millimeter wavelengths and
at optical wavelength coronographic imaging. We have obtained 20 microns images
which show an unexpected ellipse-shaped disk structure in emission at a
distance of about 260 AU from the central star. Large azimuthal asymmetries in
brightness can be noticed and the center of the ellipse does not coincide with
the star. A simple, pure geometrical model based on an emission ring of uniform
surface brightness, but having an intrinsic eccentricity succeeds in fitting
the observations. These observations give for the first time clues on a very
peculiar structure of pre-main-sequence disk geometry, i.e. a non uniform
increase in the disk thickness unlike the common usual sketch of a disk with a
constant flaring angle. They provide also valuable informations on the disk
inclination as well as its dust composition; at such a large distance from the
star, only transient heating of very small particles can explain such a bright
ring of emission at mid-infrared wavelengths. Finally, the increase of
thickness inferred by the model could be caused by disk instabilities; the
intrinsic eccentricity of the structure might be a clue to the presence of a
massive body undetected yet.

when the dark energy density needs to initially lie in a narrow range in order
for its present value to be consistent with observations. As recently noticed,
this problem becomes particularly severe in canonical Quintessence scenarios,
when trying to reproduce the behavior of a cosmological constant, i.e. when the
dark energy equation of state w_Q approaches -1: these models may be reconciled
with a large basin of attraction only by requiring a rapid evolution of w_Q at
low reshifts, which is in conflict with the most recent estimates from type Ia
Supernovae discovered by Hubble Space Telescope. Next, we focus on
scalar-tensor theories of gravity, discussing the implications of a coupling
between the Quintessence scalar field and the Ricci scalar (``Extended
Quintessence''). We show that, even if the equation of state today is very
close to -1, by virtue of the scalar-tensor coupling the quintessence
trajectories still possess the attractive feature which allows to reach the
present level of cosmic acceleration starting by a set of initial conditions
which covers tens of orders of magnitude; this effect, entirely of
gravitational origin, represents a new important consequence of the possible
coupling between dark energy and gravity.

account both for Sagittarius A*'s mm and shorter wavelengths emission in the

enhancement of the mass accretion rate onto the black hole or by a
reorganization of the magnetic field coupled to the accretion gas. The
acceleration model proposed here produces distinct flare spectra that may be

1-0 S(0), and 2-1 S(1) from the central ~1 kpc regions of the archetypical
starburst galaxies, M82 and NGC 253, and the less dramatic but still vigorously
star-forming galaxies, NGC 6946 and IC 342. Like the far-infrared continuum
luminosity, the near-infrared H2 emission luminosity can directly trace the
amount of star formation activity because the H2 emission lines arise from the
interaction between hot and young stars and nearby neutral clouds. The observed
H2 line ratios show that both thermal and non-thermal excitation are
responsible for the emission lines, but that the great majority of the
near-infrared H2 line emission in these galaxies arises from energy states
excited by ultraviolet fluorescence. The derived physical conditions, e.g.,
far-ultraviolet radiation field and gas density, from [C II] and [O I] lines
and far-infrared continuum observations when used as inputs to
photodissociation models, also explain the luminosity of the observed H2 v=1-0
S(1) line. The ratio of the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line to far-IR continuum luminosity
is remarkably constant over a broad range of galaxy luminosities; L_H2/L_FIR =
about 10^{-5}, in normal late-type galaxies (including the Galactic center), in
nearby starburst galaxies, and in luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs: L_FIR > 10^{11}

region models, we conclude that it implies that the strength of the incident UV

and R2Sn2O7 (R = rare earth) display a host of interesting physical behaviours
depending on the flavour of rare earth ion. These properties depend on the
value of the total magnetic moment, the crystal field interactions at each rare
earth site and the complex interplay between magnetic exchange and long-range
dipole-dipole interactions. This work focuses on the low temperature physics of
the dipolar isotropic frustrated antiferromagnetic pyrochlore materials.
Candidate magnetic ground states are numerically determined at zero temperature
and the role of quantum spin fluctuations around these states are studied using
a Holstein-Primakoff spin wave expansion to order 1/S. The results indicate the
strong stability of the proposed classical ground states against quantum
fluctuations. The inclusion of long range dipole interactions causes a
restoration of symmetry and a suppression of the observed anisotropy gap
leading to an increase in quantum fluctuations in the ground state when
compared to a model with truncated dipole interactions. The system retains most
of its classical character and there is little deviation from the fully ordered
moment at zero temperature.

density matrix directly from quantum field theory at finite temperature and
density. The time evolution features a rich hierarchy of scales which are
widely separated in the nearly degenerate or relativistic cases and originate
in interference phenomena between particle and antiparticle states. In the
degenerate case the flavor asymmetry $\Delta N(t)$ relaxes to the asymptotic
limit $\Delta N(\infty)=\Delta N(0)\cos^2(2\theta)$ via dephasing resulting
from the oscillations between flavor modes that are not Pauli blocked, with a
power law $1/t$ for $t>t_s \approx 2 k_F/\Delta M^2$. $k_F$ is the largest of
the Fermi momenta. The distribution function for flavor neutrinos and
antineutrinos as well as off-diagonal densities are obtained. Flavor
particle-antiparticle pairs are produced by mixing and oscillations with
typical momentum $k\sim \bar{M}$ the average mass of the neutrinos. An
effective field theory description emerges on long time scales in which the

that rho scattering within the hadronic phase of the collision leads to a
temperature dependent, decrease of its intrinsic mass at rest, compared to the
value in vacuum. The main contributions arise from s-channel scattering with
pions through the formation of a1 resonances as well as with nucleons through
the formation of even parity, spin 3/2 [N(1720)] and 5/2 [Delta(1905)] nucleon
resonances. We show that it is possible to achieve a shift in the intrinsic
rho^0 mass of order - 40 MeV, when including the contributions of all the
relevant mesons and baryons that take part in the scattering, for temperatures
between chemical and kinetic freeze-out.

liquid theory with the Skyrme effective interaction. The zero temperature
dependence of the neutron and proton spin polarization parameters as functions
of density is found for SkM$^*$, SGII (symmetric case) and SLy4, SLy5 (strongly
asymmetric case) effective forces. By comparing free energy densities, it is
shown that in symmetric nuclear matter ferromagnetic spin state (parallel
orientation of neutron and proton spins) is more preferable than
antiferromagnetic one (antiparallel orientation of spins). Strongly asymmetric
nuclear matter undergoes at some critical density a phase transition to the
state with the oppositely directed spins of neutrons and protons while the
state with the same direction of spins does not appear. In comparison with
neutron matter, even small admixture of protons strongly decreases the
threshold density of spin instability. It is clarified that protons become
totally polarized within a very narrow density domain while the density profile

derivatives of solute chemical potentials with respect to solute molar
concentrations was made using the method presented in \cite{1}. This method is
applicable to systems in which the molar concentration of one solute is very
small compared to that of the other, like in our case. The approach is
illustrated for the lysozyme chloride-Na$_2$SO$_4$-water system at 25$^o$ C, pH
4.5 and at 0.6 mM (8.6 mg/mL) lysozyme chloride and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.65, and
0.8 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ concentrations. The calculated solute chemical potential
derivatives were used to compute the protein cation charge approximately. We
also compute the diffusion Onsager coefficients $(L_{ij})_o$ for each
composition at pH 4.5.

standard random walk usually assumed. The general validity and the implications
of the results are discussed.

applied to the social network of bottlenose dolphins living in Doubtful Sound,
New Zealand. We identify communities and subcommunities within the dolphin
population and present evidence that sex- and age-related homophily play a role
in the formation of clusters of preferred companionship. We also identify
brokers who act as links between subcommunities and who appear to be crucial to
the social cohesion of the population as a whole. The network is found to be
similar to human social networks in some respects but different in some others
such as the level of assortative mixing by degree within the population. This
difference elucidates some of the means by which the network formed and
evolves.

security, this result sheds also new light on the unconditional security of the
BB84 protocol in its original prepare-and-measure form. In particular, it
indicates that for small qubit error rates 25% is the ultimate upper security
bound for any prepare-and-measure BB84-type QKD protocol. On the contrary, for
qubit error rates between 25% and 75% we demonstrate that the correlations
shared between Alice and Bob can always be explained by separable states and
thus, no secret key can be distilled in this regime.
