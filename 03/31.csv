intrinsic absorption systems show multiple components with intrinsic widths of
100 km/s spread over a blue-shifted velocity range of less than 1000 km/s.
Galaxies in our sample with existing X-ray or longer wavelength UV observations
also show C IV absorption and evidence of a soft X-ray warm absorber. In some
cases, a UV absorption component has physical properties similar to the X-ray
absorbing gas, but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between
the UV and X-ray absorbing components. Models in which a thermally driven wind
evaporates material from the obscuring torus naturally produce such

emission dominates energetically, and its high-energy tail is due to scattering
by hybrid, thermal/nonthermal electrons, probably in active regions above the
disk surface. State transitions appear to correspond to a variable inner radius
of the cold disk driven by changes of the accretion rate. The existence of two
accretion solutions, hot and cold, in a range of the accretion rate leads to

hypercompact HII regions, we consider the radio continuum energy distribution
from an ensemble of spherical clumps. An analytic expression for the free-free
emission from a single spherical clump is derived. The radio continuum slope
(with F_\nu \nu^\alpha) is governed by the population of clump optical depths
N(tau), such that (a) at frequencies where all clumps are thick, a continuum
slope of +2 is found, (b) at frequencies where all clumps are optically thin, a
flattened slope of -0.11 is found, and (c) at intermediate frequencies, a
power-law segment of significant bandwidth with slopes between these two
limiting values can result. For the ensemble distribution, we adopt a power-law
distribution N(tau) tau^{-\gamma}, and find that significant power-law segments
in the SED with slopes from +2 to -0.11 result only for a relatively restricted
range of $\gamma$ values of 1 to 2. Further, a greater range of clump optical
depths for this distribution leads to a wider bandwidth over which the
intermediate power-law segment exists. The model is applied to the source
W49N-B2 with an observed slope of \alphab +0.9, but that may be turning over to
become optically thin around 2 mm. An adequate fit is found in which most
clumps are optically thin and there is little shadowing of rearward clumps by
foreground clumps (i.e., the geometrical covering factor C<<1). The primary
insight gained from our study is that in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit for the
Planck function that applies for the radio band, it is the distribution in
optical depth of the clump population that is solely responsible for setting
the continuum shape, with variations in the size and temperature of clumps
serving to modulate the level of free-free emission.

induced gas motions and waves in clusters of galaxies. These simulations are
motivated by recent detections of ripples in the Perseus and Virgo clusters.
Although the sound waves generated by buoyant bubbles decay with distance from
the cluster center, we show that these waves can contribute substantially to
offsetting the radiative cooling at distances significantly exceeding the
bubble size. The energy flux of the waves declines more steeply with radius
than the inverse-square law predicted by energy conservation, implying that
dissipation plays an important role in tapping the wave energy. We show that
such dispersing sound waves/weak shocks are detectable as ripples on
unsharp-masked X-ray cluster maps, and point out that the interfaces between
the intracluster medium and old bubbles are also clearly detectable in
unsharp-masked X-ray maps. This opens up the possibility of detecting fossil
bubbles that are difficult to detect in radio emission. This mode of heating is
consistent with other observational constraints, such as the presence of cool
rims around the bubbles and the absence of strong shocks. Thus, the mechanism
offers a way of heating clusters in a spatially distributed and gentle fashion.
We also discuss the energy transfer between the central AGN and the surrounding
medium. In our numerical experiments, we find that roughly 65 per cent of the
energy injected by the AGN is transferred to the intracluster medium and
approximately 25 percent of the injected energy is dissipated by viscous
effects and contributes to heating of the gas. The overall transfer of heat
from the AGN to the gas is comparable to the radiative cooling losses. The
simulations were performed with the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code.

number of successful predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these are made
without the assumption that dark matter plays a significant role. MOND requires
gravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where
dynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories
proposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of
general relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or
violated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an
\textit{a priori} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory
which resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a
scalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of
its free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic
dynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are
small. We calculate the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ PPN coefficients showing them to
agree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by
nonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for
dynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics
of a system, the new theory's predictions for lensing by that system's visible
matter will agree as well with observations as general relativity's predictions
made with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based
on the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they
predict slow evolution of the scalar field. For a range of initial conditions,
this last result makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric,
scalar and vector waves.

gas in the central regions of clusters through dynamical friction. For
plausible values of the galaxy mass-to-light ratio, the heating rate is
comparable to the cooling rate due to X-ray emission. Heating occurs only for
supersonic galaxy motions, so the mechanism is self-regulating: it becomes
efficient only when the gas sound speed is smaller than the galaxy velocity
dispersion. We illustrate with the Perseus cluster, assuming a stellar
mass-to-light ratio for galaxies in the very central region with the
dark-matter contribution becoming comparable to this at some radius $r_s$. For
$r_s \la 400 {\rm kpc} \sim 3 r_{\rm cool}$--corresponding to an average
mass-to-light ratio of $\sim10$ inside that radius--the dynamical-friction
coupling is strong enough to provide the required rate of gas heating. The
measured sound speed is smaller than the galaxy velocity dispersion, as
required by this mechanism. With this smaller gas temperature and the observed
distribution of galaxies and gas, the energy reservoir in galactic motions is
sufficient to sustain the required heating rate for the lifetime of the
cluster. The galaxies also lose a smaller amount of energy through dynamical
friction to the dark matter implying that non--cooling-flow clusters should
have flat-cored dark-matter density distributions.

density field. We test these assumption using several large N-body simulations
with 384^3-1024^3 particles and box sizes between 100-1000h/Mpc, which can both
resolve the small galactic size halos and sample the large scale fluctuations.
We explore the average halo bias relation as a function of halo mass and show
that existing fitting formulae overestimate the halo bias by up to 20% in the
regime just below the nonlinear mass. We propose a new expression that fits our
simulations well. We find that the halo bias is nearly constant, b~0.65-0.7,
for masses below one tenth of the nonlinear mass. We explore next the relation
between the initial and final dark matter in individual Fourier modes and show
that there are significant fluctuations in their ratio, ranging from 10% rms at
k~0.03h/Mpc to 50% rms at k~0.1h/Mpc. We argue that these large fluctuations
are caused by perturbative effects beyond the linear theory, which are
dominated by long wavelength modes with large random fluctuations. Similar or
larger fluctuations exist between halos and dark matter and between halos of
different mass. While these fluctuations are small compared to the sampling
variance, they are significant for attempts to determine the bias by relating

longitude, as expected from models of the orbit and destruction of Sgr. A
minimum 8 kpc width of the trailing stream about the Sgr orbital midplane is
implied by verified RV members. The coldness of this stream (dispersion ~10
km/s) provides upper limits on the combined contributions of stream heating by
a lumpy Galactic halo and the intrinsic dispersion of released stars, which is
a function of the Sgr core mass. The Sgr trailing arm is consistent with a
Galactic halo containing one dominant, LMC-like lump, however some lumpier
halos are not ruled out. An upper limit to the total M/L of the Sgr core is 21
in solar units. A second structure that roughly mimics expectations for
wrapped, leading Sgr arm debris crosses the trailing arm in the Southern
Hemisphere; however, this may also be an unrelated tidal feature. Among the <13

identify them as halo stars, perhaps part of the Sgr leading arm near the Sun.
The positions and RVs of Southern Hemisphere M giants are compared with those

which attenuates the radiation and affects the shape of emission line profiles.
None of the existing models was able to fit the observationed lines
consistently. The possible caveat of these models was the assumption of a
smooth stellar wind. Motivated by the various evidences that the stellar winds
are in fact structured, we present a 2-D numerical model of a stochastic,
inhomogeneous wind. Small parcels of hot, X-ray emitting gas are permeated with
cool, absorbing wind material which is compressed into thin shell fragments.
Wind fragmentation alters the radiative transfer drastically, compared to
homogeneous models of the same mass-loss rate. X-rays produced deep inside the
wind, which would be totally absorbed in a homogeneous flow, can effectively
escape from a fragmented wind. The wind absorption becomes wavelength
independent if the individual fragments are optically thick. The X-ray line
profiles are flat-topped in the blue part and decline steeply in the red part
for the winds with short acceleration zone. For the winds where the
acceleration extends over significant distances, the lines can appear nearly
symmetric and only slightly blueshifted, in contrast to the skewed, triangular
line profiles typically obtained from homogeneous wind models of high optical
depth. We show that profiles from a fragmented wind model can reproduce the
observed line profiles from zeta Orionis.

extensive device simulation and design. Scattering in SNWTs is then treated by
a simple model that uses so-called Buttiker probes, which was previously used

cases, the fundamental object is the flux to a circular disk, obtained by
conformal mapping from more complicated shapes. We construct the first accurate
numerical solution using an efficient new method, which involves mapping to the
interior of the disk and using a spectral method in polar coordinates. Our
method also combines exact asymptotics and an adaptive mesh to handle boundary
layers. Starting from a well-known integral equation in streamline coordinates,
we also derive new, high-order asymptotic expansions for high and low P\'eclet

for such low $\Pe$ as $10^{-3}$. The two expansions overlap well near $\Pe =
0.1$, allowing the construction of an analytical connection formula that is
uniformly accurate for all $\Pe$ and angles on the disk with a maximum relative
error of 1.75%. We also obtain an analytical formula for the Nusselt number
($\Nu$) as a function of the P\'eclet number with a maximum relative error of
0.53% for all possible geometries. Because our finite-plate problem can be
conformally mapped to other geometries, the general problem of two-dimensional

investigated numerically. Such ``discrete folding'' has come under through
theoretical investigation, since Bowick and co-worker introduced it as a
simplified model for the crumpling of the phantom polymerized membranes. So
far, it has been analyzed with the hexagon approximation of the cluster
variation method (CVM). However, the possible systematic error of the
approximation was not fully estimated; in fact, it has been known that the
transfer-matrix calculation is limited in the tractable strip widths L \le 6.
Aiming to surmount this limitation, we utilized the density-matrix
renormalization group. Thereby, we succeeded in treating strip widths up to
L=29 which admit reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. Our data
indicate an onset of a discontinuous crumpling transition with the latent heat
substantially larger than the CVM estimate. It is even larger than the latent
heat of the planar (two dimensional) folding, as first noticed by the preceding
CVM study. That is, contrary to our naive expectation, the discontinuous
character of the transition is even promoted by the enlargement of the
embedding-space dimensions. We also calculated the folding entropy, which
appears to lie within the best analytical bound obtained previously via
combinatorics arguments.

singlet FF changes by barely a factor of 2 after evolving it over $\sim$ 14
orders of magnitude in $Q\sim M_X$. We, therefore, argue that as long as the

uncertain by a factor of 2 or larger, it is good enough for most practical
purposes to directly use any one of the available initial parametrisations of

equations exist anymore and show that it is smaller than in the one-body case

in studies of gauge field theories is presented. The three paradigms of
topological objects, the Nielsen-Olesen vortex of the abelian Higgs model, the
't Hooft-Polyakov monopole of the non-abelian Higgs model and the instanton of
Yang-Mills theory, are discussed. The common formal elements in their
construction are emphasized and their different dynamical roles are exposed.
The discussion of applications of topological methods to Quantum Chromodynamics
focuses on confinement. An account is given of various attempts to relate this
phenomenon to topological properties of Yang-Mills theory. The lecture notes
also include an introduction to the underlying concept of homotopy with
applications from various areas of physics.

is derived for the spectral-angular distribution of this radiation. Under the

oscillator drift velocity this formula contains two summands. The first one
corresponds to the radiation with a continuous spectrum which propagates at the
Cherenkov angle of the external medium. The second one describes the radiation
which has a discrete spectrum for a given angle of propagation. The
corresponding frequencies are multiples of the Doppler-shifted oscillation
frequency. The results of numerical calculations for the angular distribution

prove a functional central limit theorem (CLT) under the a priori assumption

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Then, we study the R^N in equilibrium under
the stability condition \alpha < \beta, and prove a functional CLT with limit
the OU process in equilibrium. We use ergodicity and justify the inversion of
limits for large times and for large sizes N by a compactness-uniqueness

interesting result in its own right. The main tool for proving tightness of the
implicitly defined invariant laws in the CLT scaling and ergodicity of the

reflection principle with the Behnke-Sommer continuity principle. Extending a
so-called reflection function to a parameterized congruence of Segre varieties,
we are led to studying the envelope of holomorphy of a certain domain covered
by a smooth Levi-flat ``hat''. In our main theorem, we show that every
C^infty-smooth CR diffeomorphism h: M to M' between two globally minimal real
analytic hypersurfaces in C^n (n >1) is real analytic at every point of M if M'
is holomorphically nondegenerate. More generally, we establish that the
reflection function R_h' associated to such a C^infty-smooth CR diffeomorphism
between two globally minimal hypersurfaces in C^n (n > 1) always extends
holomorphically to a neighborhood of the graph of \bar{h} in M\times \bar{M}',
without any nondegeneracy condition on M'. This gives a new version of the
Schwarz symmetry principle in several complex variables. Finally, as an
appendix, we show that every C^infty-smooth CR mapping h: M to M' between two
real analytic hypersurfaces containing no complex curves is real analytic at
every point of M, without any rank condition on h. This answers a conjecture,

path of the pump beam. In the longitudinal E-field configuration currently
exploited in an ongoing APV measurement, this number is limited only by the
total voltage sustainable by the Cs vapor. In order to overcome this limit, we
consider, both theoretically and experimentally, the possibility of performing
the measurements in a transverse E-field configuration requiring a much lower

magnetoelectric optical effects entering into play. They condition
modifications of the experimental configuration with, in particular, the

quantum noise limited measurement can be expected, now limited only by the
necessity of operating below the threshold of spontaneous superradiant emission

on large length scales are found to be predominantly a consequence of a
coarse-graining effect of fluctuations on shorter length scales. This is
verified for both the mouse and the human genome. We also found that both
species show similar standard deviation of fluctuations even though their mean
substitution rate differs by a factor of two. Our method furthermore allows to
determine time-resolved substitution rate maps from which we can compute
auto-correlation functions in order to quantify how fast the spatial
fluctuations in substitution rate change in time.
