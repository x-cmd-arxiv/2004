nearby galaxies appear to be described by the respective ``universal''
luminosity functions, whose shapes do not vary significantly from galaxy to
galaxy and the normalizations are proportional to the SFR (HMXBs) and stellar
mass (LMXBs) of the host galaxy. There is a significant qualitative difference
between XLFs of high and low mass X-ray binaries, reflecting the difference in
the accretion regimes in these two types of X-ray binaries.
  The high luminosity cut-off is by an order of magnitude larger for HMXBs --
although bright sources, log(Lx)>39, are observed in both young and old
galaxies, the truly ultraluminous ones, with log(Lx)~40-40.5, are associated
with the regions of intense star formation and have not been detected so far in
old stellar populations of elliptical and S0 galaxies. The Lx-SFR relation for
distant galaxies in the HDF-N indicates that ULXs at redshifts of z~0.2-1.3
were not significantly more luminous than those observed in nearby galaxies.

ON2 III(f*), newly defining that category. These characteristics strongly
suggest a larger fraction of processed material in the atmospheres of the ON2
stars, which we confirm by modeling the optical spectra. In the context of
current models, it is in turn implied that the ON2 stars are in a more advanced
evolutionary state than the others, and/or that they had higher initial
rotational velocities. The recent formulation of the effects of rotation on
massive stellar evolution introduces an additional fundamental parameter, which
the CNO abundances are in principle able to constrain. We present some
illustrative comparisons with current Geneva evolutionary models for rotating
massive stars. It is possible that these very hot, nitrogen-rich objects are

non-Gaussian signal in the wavelet space. In particular, a value of the
normalization sigma_8 = 1 would imply a highly significant skewness and
kurtosis in the wavelet coefficients at scales around 3 arcmin. Models with a
more moderate excess also show a non-Gaussian signal in the simulated data. We
conclude that current data (ACBAR) should show this signature if the excess is
to be due to the SZ effect. Otherwise, the reason for that excess should be
explained by some systematic effect. The significance of the non-Gaussian
signal depends on the cluster model but it grows with the surveyed area.
Non-Gaussianity test performed on incoming data sets should reveal the presence

by tide. Motivated by inner halo satellite remnants like the Sgr and Omega Cen,
we develop fully analytical models to study the orbital decay and tidal
massloss of satellites. The orbital decay rate is often severely overestimated
if applying the ChandraSekhar's formula without correcting for (a) the
evaporation and tidal loss of the satellite and (b) the contraction of
satellite orbits due to adiabatic growth of the host galaxy potential over the
Hubble time. As a satellite migrates inwards, the increasing halo density
affects the dynamical friction in two opposite ways:(1) it boosts the number of
halo particles swept in the satellite's gravitational ""wake"", hence increasing
the drag on the satellite, and (2) it boosts the tide which ""peels off"" the
satellite, and reduces the amplitude of the wake. These competing processes can
be modeled analytically for a satellite with the help of an empirical formula
for the massloss history. The analytical model agrees with more numerical
simulations of tidal massloss and dynamical friction. Rapid massloss due to
increasing tides at ever smaller radius makes it less likely for streams or
remnants of infalling satellites to intrude the inner halo (as the Sgr stream
and oCen) than to stay in the outer halo (Magellanic stream), hence any
intermediate-mass central black holes of the satellites are also likely ""hung
up"" at large distances as well. To avoid ""hung-up"" the satellites might start
with (i) pericenters much smaller than the typical distances to present-day
observed satellites and with (ii) central density much higher than in the often
seen finite density cores of observed satellites.

population, dubbed the shroud (Gyuk & Gates 1999, Gates & Gyuk 2001). The
shroud would be a very thick Galactic disk of low luminosity objects, most
likely old white dwarfs, proposed to explain the optical depth seen in
microlensing surveys towards the Magellanic clouds. The shroud is a simple
alternative to the lenses being distributed in a classical, near-spherical dark
halo; the advantage of the shroud is that it would compose only a fraction of a
dark halo's total mass.
  In this paper, we argue that stars of the Galactic shroud would be detectable
in the recent proper motion survey of Oppenheimer et al. (2001) if their
absolute luminosities were brighter than M_R_59F = 19.4 or approximately M_V =
18.6. We adopt a range of simple models of the shroud's kinematics and
morphology, and the colours and luminosities of its white dwarfs; via
Monte-Carlo simulations, we predict the numbers expected in the Oppenheimer et
al. survey, which would be clearly separated from the numbers produced by white
dwarfs of the disk, thick disk and halo.
  The number of white dwarf detections in the proper motion survey (98) is
found to be well explained by the disk, thick disk and halo. With the most
conservative kinematic and density parameters for the shroud, and an absolute
luminosity of the white dwarfs of M_R_59F = 17.6, we find that the proper
motion survey would detect over 100 WDs, just from the shroud. For a M_R_59F =
19.4 shroud, the survey would find 5 +/- 2 peculiar objects, whereas only two
white dwarfs with such characteristics are found in the original data. M_R_59F
= 19.4 corresponds to M_V = 18.6 for WDs with V - I = -1.030.

processes play an important role in their extended atmospheres and winds. The
interpretation of observations, and in particular of high-resolution IR
spectra, requires realistic self-consistent model atmospheres. Current
dynamical models include rather detailed micro-physics, and the resulting
synthetic spectra compare reasonably well with observations. A transition from
qualitative to quantitative modelling is taking place at present. We give an
overview of existing dynamical model atmospheres for AGB stars, discussing
recent advances and current trends in modelling, including 3D 'star-in-a-box'
models. When comparing synthetic spectra and other observable properties
resulting from dynamical models with observations we focus on the near- and
mid-IR wavelength range.

with a core of a fraction of an Earth's mass located at 8 AU, we end our
simulation with the onset of runaway gas accretion when the planet is at 5.5 AU
1 Myr later. This timescale is about a factor ten shorter than the one found by
Pollack et al. (\cite{P96}) even though the disc was less massive initially and
viscously evolving. Other initial conditions can lead to even shorter
timescales. The reason for this speed-up is found to result from the fact that
a moving planet does not deplete its feeding zone to the extend of a static
planet. Thus, the uncomfortably long formation timescale associated with the
core-accretion scenario can be considerably reduced and brought in much better
agreement with the typical disc lifetimes inferred from observations of young
circumstellar discs.

that the anisotropic mechanism is commonly operating among polars. On the other
hand, those of intermediate polars are statistically consistent with being
unmodulated with an upper limit of 1.5 times modulation. This may be due to a
different accretion manner like aurora curtain (Rosen etal 1988) so that the
plasma becomes optically thin along the horizontal axis also for the resonance
lines, or because of larger optical depths for Compton scattering if the
emission regions have the same coin-like shapes as polars.

also report on quasi-simultaneous observations at a wavelength of 3.4 mm using
the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array. A flare was detected
in the X-domain with an excess 2-8 keV luminosity of about 6$\times10^{33}$
erg/s. A fading flare of Sgr A* with $>$2 times the interim-quiescent flux was
also detected at the beginning of the NIR observations, that overlapped with
the fading part of the X-ray flare. Compared to 8-9 hours before the NIR/X-ray
flare we detected a marginally significant increase in the millimeter flux
density of Sgr A* during measurements about 7-9 hours afterwards. We find that
the flaring state can be conveniently explained with a synchrotron self-Compton
model involving up-scattered sub-millimeter photons from a compact source
component, possibly with modest bulk relativistic motion. The size of that
component is assumed to be of the order of a few times the Schwarzschild
radius. The overall spectral indices $\alpha_{NIR/X-ray}$
($S_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu^{-\alpha}$) of both states are quite comparable with a
value of $\sim$1.3. Since the interim-quiescent X-ray emission is spatially
extended, the spectral index for the interim-quiescent state is probably only a
lower limit for the compact source Sgr A*. A conservative estimate of the upper
limit of the time lag between the ends of the NIR and X-ray flare is of the
order of 15 minutes.

the signal for connecting an alarm in the original system that efficiently

optical dipole traps made from combinations of laser beams having two different

the relative laser powers, to selectively trap the two species in such a way
that fermions experience a stronger confinement than bosons. As a consequence,
a deep Fermi degeneracy can be reached having at the same time a softer
degenerate regime for the Bose gas. This leads to an increase in the
sympathetic cooling efficiency and allows for higher precision thermometry of

clash with analyticity of the self-energy, reflecting causality of the theory,

value of $\sin 2 \beta$ without conflicting with other experimental

from the flavor changing Yukawa interactions between neutral Higgs bosons and
the heavy fourth generation down type quark, which can modify the QCD penguin
contributions. With the constraints obtained from $b \to s \bar{s} s$ processes
such as $B \to X_s \gamma$ and $\Delta m_{B_s^0}$, this model can lead to the

moduli can play an important role in giving a viable string realisation of
sequestering in the limit where supersymmetry breaking comes entirely from the
twisted moduli. We focus on a particular string inspired version of gaugino
mediation in which the first two families are localised at the intersection
between D5-branes, whereas the third family and Higgs doublets are allowed to
move within the world-volume of one of the branes. The soft supersymmetry
breaking third family sfermion mass terms are then in general non-degenerate
with the first two families. We place constraints upon parameter space and
predictions of flavour changing neutral current effects. Twisted moduli
domination is studied and, as well as solving the most serious part of the SUSY
flavour problem, is shown to be highly constrained. The constraints are
weakened by switching on gravity-mediated contributions from the dilaton and
untwisted T-moduli sectors. In the twisted moduli domination limit we predict a
stop-heavy MSSM spectrum and quasi-degenerate lightest neutralino and chargino
states with wino-dominated mass eigenstates.

the early universe, it has been realized that trans-Planckian physics may
manifest itself at energies much lower than the Planck energy. The presence of
a fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at
sufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different
models that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the
trans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.
However, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz
invariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to
study the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models
that preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental
scale. In this work, we construct one such model and evaluate the resulting
spectrum of density perturbations in the power-law inflationary scenario. While
our model reproduces the standard spectrum on small scales, it naturally
predicts a suppression of power on large scales. In fact, the spectrum we
obtain has some features which are similar to the one that has recently been
obtained from non-commutative inflation. However, we find that the amount of
suppression predicted by our model is far less than that is required to fit the
observations. We comment on the fact that, with a suitable choice of initial
conditions, our approach can lead to corrections at the infra-red as well as at
the ultra-violet ends of the spectrum.

exists no stationary perturbation that is regular at the horizon(s) and falls
off at infinity in the case of negative cosmological constant, except for those
corresponding to the stationary rotation of black holes and the variation of

hole solutions that are either asymptotically flat, de Sitter or anti-de Sitter

cosmological constant near the spherically symmetric and static limit. A
similar conclusion is obtained for topological black holes. It is also pointed
out that this perturbative uniqueness near the static limit may not hold in the

vacuum solutions are considered and fully described. It is specially pointed
out that solitary waves with various, in fact arbitrary, spatial structure and
photon-like propagation properties exist. The {\it null} character of all
non-linear vacuum solutions is established and extensively used further.
Coordinate-free definitions are given to the important quantities {\it

introduced and used as a criterion for availability of rotational component of
propagation of some of the nonlinear, i.e. nonmaxwellian, vacuum solutions. The
group structure properties of the nonlinear vacuum solutions are analyzed in
some detail, showing explicitly the connection of the vacuum solutions with
some complex valued functions. Connection-curvature interpretations are given
and a special attention is paid to the curvature interpretation of the
intrinsic rotational (spin) properties of some of the nonlinear solutions.
Several approaches to coordinate-free local description and computation of the
integral spin momentum are considered. Finally, a large family of nonvacuum
spatial soliton-like solutions is explicitly written down, and a procedure to
get (3+1) versions of the known (1+1) soliton solutions is obtained.

the approach of Epstein and Glaser (EG) and, in particular, its formulation in
the language of graphs and Hopf algebras (HAs). Various HAs are encountered,
each one associated with a special combination of physical concepts such as
normalization, localization, pseudo-unitarity, causality and an associated
regularization, and renormalization. The algebraic structures, representing the
perturbative expansion of the S-matrix, are imposed on the operator-valued
distributions which are equipped with appropriate graph indices. Translation
invariance ensures the algebras to be analytically well-defined and graded
total symmetry allows to formulate bialgebras. The algebraic results are given
embedded in the physical framework, which covers the two recent EG versions by
Fredenhagen and Scharf that differ with respect to the concrete recursive
implementation of causality. Besides, the ultraviolet divergences occuring in
Feynman's representation are mathematically reasoned. As a final result, the

rigorous. Even when X is non-regular, but ""small cycles are dense"" in X, we
show that the graph X is non-amenable if and only if the non-backtracking
n-step transition probabilities decay exponentially fast. This is a partial
generalization of the cogrowth criterion for regular graphs which comprises the
original cogrowth criterion for finitely generated groups of Grigorchuk and
Cohen.

non-perturbatively through the calculation of the electron-positron vertex
function. It corresponds to the sum of an infinite series of ladder diagrams,
and describes the physical effect of virtual positronium formation. The vertex
function is used to calculate the positron-atom correlation potential and
nonlocal corrections to the electron-positron annihilation vertex. Numerically,
we make use of B-spline basis sets, which ensures rapid convergence of the sums
over intermediate states. We have also devised an extrapolation procedure that
allows one to achieve convergence with respect to the number of
intermediate-state orbital angular momenta included in the calculations. As a
test, the present formalism is applied to positron scattering and annihilation
on hydrogen, where it is exact. Our results agree with those of accurate
variational calculations. We also examine in detail the properties of the large

for it to allow differentiation.
  These conditions are expressed as follows in mathematical terms. Let $F$ be a
differentiable mapping from a finite dimensional real vector space to itself.
The signs of the entries of the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at a given point $a$
define an interaction graph, i.e. a finite oriented finite graph $G(a)$ where
each edge is equipped with a sign. Ren\'e Thomas conjectured twenty years ago
that, if $F$ has at least two non degenerate zeroes, there exists $a$ such that
$G(a)$ contains a positive circuit. Different authors proved this in special
cases, and we give here a general proof of the conjecture. In particular, we
get this way a necessary condition for genetic networks to lead to
multistationarity, and therefore to differentiation.
  We use for our proof the mathematical literature on global univalence, and we
show how to derive from it several variants of Thomas' rule, some of which had
been anticipated by Kaufman and Thomas.
