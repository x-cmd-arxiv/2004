Region of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS), along with emission
measure (EM) fluctuations in the same field taken from the Southern H-Alpha Sky
Survey Atlas. The structure function of RM fluctuations shows a relatively
steep slope at small scales (1-5 arcmin), a break in slope to a flatter
structure function at intermediate scales (5-60 arcmin), and a systematic
variation of the strength of fluctuations as a function of position angle on
the sky at the largest scales (60-200 arcmin). The structure function of EM
fluctuations shows similar behavior, although the lower resolution of the data
prevents detection of a possible break in the spectrum. We interpret the
anisotropy in RM/EM structure on large scales as resulting from a large-scale
gradient in electron density (and possibly magnetic field) across the region.
The break in the slope of the RM structure function at scales of about 5 arcmin
can be explained by contributions from two spatially distinct magneto-ionized
screens, most likely in the Local and Carina spiral arms. The observed
structure function then implies that the outer scale of RM fluctuations in
these screens is about 2 pc. We conclude that we have identified an additional
source of enhanced turbulence, injected on scales of a few pc, possibly seen
only in the Galactic plane. The most likely source of such turbulence is
individual HII regions from relatively low-mass stars, whose characteristic
scale size is similar to the outer scale of turbulence inferred here. These
sources may be the dominant source of density and velocity fluctuations in warm
ionized gas in the Galactic plane.

``minimal'' cooling or ``enhanced'' cooling is proposed. The minimal cooling
scenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to
include neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process.
This emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures
close to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is
distinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from
any direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica. Within the
minimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a
four parameter family involving the equation of state of dense matter,
superfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star
envelope, and the mass of the neutron star. Consequences of minimal cooling are
explored through extensive variations of these parameters. Results are compared
with the inferred properties of thermally-emitting neutron stars in order to
ascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which
thermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent
with the lack of enhanced cooling. The two pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR
1706-44 would require enhanced cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures
are on the lower side of their estimated values whereas the four stars PSR
0656+14, PSR 1055-52, Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of
internal heating in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of
their estimated values. The new upper limits on the thermal luminosity of PSR
J0205+6449 and RX J0007.0+7302 are indicative of the occurrence of some
enhanced neutrino emission beyond the minimal scenario.

range $\bf x$ to ${\bf x}+\Delta {\bf x}$. In the nonlinear regime,
$\delta({\bf k, x})$ is highly non-Gaussian. We find, however, that the
correlations between $\delta({\bf k, x})$ and $\delta({\bf k', x'})$ are always
very weak if the spatial ranges (${\bf x}$, ${\bf x}+\Delta {\bf x}$) and
(${\bf x'}$, ${\bf x'}+\Delta {\bf x'}$) don't overlap. This feature is due to
the fact that the spatial locality of the initial perturbations is memorized
during hierarchical clustering. The highly spatial locality of the 2MASS galaxy
correlations is a strong evidence for the initial perturbations of the cosmic
mass field being spatially localized, and therefore, consistent with a Gaussian
initial perturbations on scales as small as about 0.1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc. Moreover,
the 2MASS galaxy spatial locality indicates that the relationship between
density perturbations of galaxies and the underlying dark matter should be
localized in phase space. That is, for a structure consisting of perturbations
on scales from $k$ to $ k+\Delta {k}$, the nonlocal range in the relation
between galaxies and dark matter should {\it not} be larger than $|{\Delta {\bf

relation between galaxies and dark matter fields should be no more than the
allowed range given by the uncertainty relation $|{\Delta {\bf x}|| \Delta{\bf

all, so-called ``power-law'' galaxies are better described as ``Sersic

the limits of HST resolution -- and that ``core'' galaxies are best understood
as consisting of an outer Sersic profile with an inner power-law cusp, which is
a downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of the Sersic profile. This
definition of cores resolves ambiguities that result when the popular ``Nuker
law'' is fitted to the profiles of ellipticals and bulges, particularly at
lower luminosities. We also find that using the Nuker law to model core-galaxy

theoretical problem of achieving rapid growth of magnetic fields in such

that a multiphase ISM that is dominated by realistic energy inputs via
supernova explosions will naturally become a strongly turbulent medium with
large positive and negative values of the fluid helicity. The resultant
interstellar turbulence seems to have some of the essential characteristics of
a fast dynamo. Magnetic field growth in such a turbulent dynamo is studied in
this paper. It is shown that the field undergoes a linear phase of evolution
where it has a time of growth that is comparable to the eddy turn-over time.
Energetics, power spectra, statistics and structures of the turbulent dynamo
are studied here. It is shown that despite the fact that the ISM is driven by
compressive motions, the kinetic energy in this high Mach number flow is mainly
concentrated in solenoidal motions rather than compressive motions.

dwarf elliptical galaxy, in the early stages of a starburst episode.
Contributions to the X-ray emission come from discrete point sources and
extended diffuse emission, in the form of what appear to be multiple
superbubbles, and smaller bubbles probably associated with individual star
clusters. Chandra detects 17 sources within the optical extent of NGC5253 down
to a completeness level corresponding to a luminosity of 1.5E37 erg/s.The slope
of the point source X-ray luminosity function is -0.54, similar to that of
other nearby dwarf starburst galaxies. Several different types of source are
detected within the galaxy, including X-ray binaries and the emission
associated with star-clusters.
  Comparison of the diffuse X-ray emission with the observed Halpha emission
shows similarities in their extent. The best spectral fit to the diffuse
emission is obtained with an absorbed, two temperature model giving
temperatures for the two gas components of ~0.24keV and ~0.75keV.The derived
parameters of the diffuse X-ray emitting gas are as follows: a total mass of
\~1.4E6 f^{1/2} Msun, where f is the volume filling factor of the X-ray
emitting gas, and a total thermal energy content for the hot X-ray emitting gas
of \~3.4E54 f^{1/2} erg. The pressure in the diffuse gas is P/k ~
1E6f^{-1/2}K/cm3. We find that these values are broadly commensurate with the
mass and energy injection from the starburst population. Analysis of the
kinematics of the starburst region suggest that the stellar ejecta contained
within it can escape the gravitational potential well of the galaxy, and
pollute the surrounding IGM.

These deviations are usually attributed to galaxy random motions and these are
incorporated in the analysis through a phenomenological model where the linear
redshift correlation is convolved with the random pairwise velocity
distribution function along the line of sight. We show that a substantial part
of the deviations arise from non-linear effects in the mapping from real to

there is no common-user infrared facility, in operation, that offers the
desired combination of spectral resolution and sensitivity. Here we focus on
what can be learned from linear spectropolarimetry alone at reasonably high
spectral resolution and at $10^3 < $S/N$ < 10^4$. And we remind that the near
infrared (1--2 micron) has the potential to out-perform the optical as a domain
to work in because of the greatly reduced interstellar obscuration at these

flexible Monte Carlo methods, is fast becoming a powerful tool. In short we
have the complex phenomena, and the rise of the modelling capability to match

X-ray flux in the region between the two, where the temperature is higher than

  Although tidal or compression effects might affect the large scale structure
of the two clusters, we show that these cannot account for the distortions seen
in the inner regions. We argue that the reasonably relaxed morphology of the
clusters, and the absence of major temperature anomalies, argues against models
in which the two have already experienced a close encounter. The properties of
the intermediate region suggests that they are at an early stage of merging,
and are currently interacting mildly, because their separation is still too
large for more dramatic effects. The substructure we find in their inner
regions seems to point to their individual merging histories. It seems likely
that in the Abell 399/401 system, we are witnessing two merger remnants, just
before they merge together to form a single rich cluster. This picture is
consistent with recent numerical simulations of cluster formation. (abridged)

(9.5 min) orbital frequency. In a previous timing study using archival ROSAT
and ASCA data we reported evidence for an increase of this frequency at a rate
consistent with expectations for gravitational radiation from a detached
ultracompact binary system. Here we report the results of new CHANDRA timing
observations which confirm the previous indications of spin-up of the X-ray
frequency, and provide much tighter constraints on the frequency derivative. We
obtained with CHANDRA a total of 90 ksec of exposure in two epochs separated in
time by 11.5 months. The total time span of the archival ROSAT, ASCA and new
CHANDRA data is now 10.5 years. This more than doubles the interval spanned by
the ROSAT and ASCA data alone, providing much greater sensitivity to a
frequency derivative. With the addition of the CHANDRA data an increasing
frequency is unavoidable, with a value df/dt = 7.0 x 10-18 Hz/s. Although a
long-term spin-up trend is confirmed, there is excess variance in the phase
timing residuals, perhaps indicative of shorter timescale torque fluctuations
or phase instability associated with the source of the X-ray flux. Power
spectral searches for periods longward of the 9.5 minute period do not find any
significant modulations, however, the sensitivity of searches in this frequency
range are somewhat compromised by the dithering of the Chandra attitude. The
observed spin-up is of a magnitude consistent with that expected from
gravitational radiation decay, however, the factor of 3 variations in flux
combined with the timing noise could conceivably result from accretion-induced
spin-up of a white dwarf. Continued monitoring to explore correlations of
torque with X-ray flux could provide a further test of this hypothesis.

a gas is highly unstable, with a maximum growth rate exceeding that of the
magnetorotational instability. The regime of interest has been treated
previously by plasma kinetic methods. Where there is overlap, our work appears
to be in agreement with the kinetic results. The nonlinear outcome of this

and error estimates, we find that brighter SNe are preferentially found behind

This is consistent with the interpretation that SNe fluxes are magnified by
foreground galaxy excess, and demagnified by foreground galaxy deficit,
compared to a smooth Universe case. The difference between most magnified and
most demagnified SNe is about 0.3-0.4 mag. The effect is significant at >99%

estimate the influence of this depolarization mechanism on the determination of

depolarization, which in turn is a natural consequence when observing a

introduce a general model of contagion which, by explicitly incorporating
memory of past exposures to, for example, an infectious agent, rumor, or new
product, includes the main features of existing contagion models and
interpolates between them. We obtain exact solutions for a simple version of
the model, finding that under general conditions only three classes of
collective dynamics exist, two of which correspond to familiar epidemic
threshold and critical mass dynamics, while the third is a distinct
intermediate case. We find that for a given length of memory, the class into
which a particular system falls is determined by two parameters, each of which
ought to be measurable empirically. Our model suggests novel measures for
assessing the susceptibility of a population to large contagion events, and
also a possible strategy for inhibiting or facilitating them.

wires at microwave frequencies (0.5-3 GHz) is investigated both experimentally
and theoretically. In the presence of the dc bias magnetic field of the order
of the anisotropy field, the impedance shows very large and sensitive change
when the wire is subjected to a tensile stress: 100% and 60% per 180 MPa for
frequencies 500 MHz and 2.5 GHz, respectively. It is demonstrated that this
behavior owes mainly to the directional change in the equilibrium magnetization
caused by the applied stress and field, which agrees well with the theoretical
results for the surface impedance. This stress effect on MI is proposed to use
for creating microwave stress-tunable composite materials containing short
magnetic wires. The analysis of the dielectric response from such materials
shows that depending on the stress level in the material, the dispersion of the
effective permittivity can be of a resonant or relaxation type with a
considerable change in its values (up to 100% at 600 MPa). This media can be
used for structural stress monitoring by microwave contrast imaging.

presented within the effective mass equation approach. The full
three-dimensional transport problem is described in terms of coupled transverse
subband modes which arise due to quantum confinement along the body thickness
direction. Couplings among the subbands are generated for two reasons: due to
spatial variations of the confinement potential along the transport direction,
and due to non-alignment of the device coordinate system with the principal
axes of the constant energy conduction band ellipsoids. The problem simplifies
considerably if the electrostatic potential is separable along transport and
confinement directions, and further if the potential variations along the
transport direction are slow enough to prevent dipolar coupling (Zener
tunneling) between subbands. In this limit, the transport problem can be solved
by employing two unitary operators to transform an arbitrarily oriented
constant energy ellipsoid into a regular ellipsoid with principal axes along
the transport, width and confinement directions of the device. The effective
masses for several technologically important wafer orientations for silicon and
germanium are calculated in this paper.

  We present Active Internet Traffic Filtering (AITF), a mechanism that
protects public-access sites from highly distributed attacks by causing
undesired traffic to be blocked as close as possible to its sources. We

alternative synchronization convention. We find that both approaches lead to
the same result without any contradictions. When applying standard coordinates
to the complete rim of the rotating disk, a time-lag has to be taken into
account which accounts for the global anisotropy. We propose a closed Minkowski
space-time as an exact equivalent to the rim of a disk, both in the rotating
and non-rotating case. In this way the Sagnac effect can be explained as being
purely topological, neglecting the radial acceleration altogether. This proves
that the rim of the disk can be treated as an inertial system. In the same
context we discuss the twin paradox and find that the standard scenario is
equivalent to an unaccelerated version in a closed space-time. The closed
topology leads to preferred frame effects which can be detected only globally.
The relation of synchronization conventions to the measurement of lengths is
discussed in the context of Ehrenfest's paradox. This leads to a confirmation
of the classical arguments by Ehrenfest and Einstein.

masses, which instead encode the effects of the stabilization. General
arguments, as well as specific examples, lead us to conjecture that, for
sufficiently large dS curvature, the compactified geometry becomes
gravitationally unstable due to the tachyonic growth of the scalar
perturbations. This mean that for any stabilization mechanism the curvature of
the dS geometry cannot exceed some critical value. We relate this effect to the
anisotropy of the bulk geometry and suggest the end points of the instability.
Of relevance for inflationary cosmology, the perturbations of the bulk metric
inevitably induce a new modulus field, which describes the conformal
fluctuations of the 4 dimensional metric. If this mode is light during
inflation, the induced conformal fluctuations will be amplified with a scale
free spectrum and with an amplitude which is disentangled from the standard
result of slow-roll inflation. The conformal 4d metric fluctuations give rise
to a very generic realization of the mechanism of modulated cosmological
fluctuations, related to spatial variation of couplings during (p)reheating
after inflation.

consider the pairwise distances $\{d(u,v)\}$ between leaves. It is well known
that these determine the tree and the $d$ length of all edges. Here we consider
distortions $\d$ of $d$ such that for all leaves $u$ and $v$ it holds that
$|d(u,v) - \d(u,v)| < f/2$ if either $d(u,v) < M$ or $\d(u,v) < M$, where $d$

show how to reconstruct in polynomial time a forest $T_1,...,T_{\alpha}$ such
that the true tree $T$ may be obtained from that forest by adding $\alpha-1$
edges and $\alpha-1 \leq 2^{-\Omega(M/g)} n$.
  Metric distortions arise naturally in phylogeny, where $d(u,v)$ is defined by
the log-det of a covariance matrix associated with $u$ and $v$. of a covariance
matrix associated with $u$ and $v$. When $u$ and $v$ are ``far'', the entries
of the covariance matrix are small and therefore $\d(u,v)$, which is defined by
log-det of an associated empirical-correlation matrix may be a bad estimate of
$d(u,v)$ even if the correlation matrix is ``close'' to the covariance matrix.
  Our metric results are used in order to show how to reconstruct phylogenetic
forests with small number of trees from sequences of length logarithmic in the
size of the tree. Our method also yields an independent proof that phylogenetic
trees can be reconstructed in polynomial time from sequences of polynomial
length under the standard assumptions in phylogeny. Both the metric result and

a product of a group and a trivial digroup. We partially solve the coquecigrue
problem by showing that to each Leibniz algebra that splits over its ideal
generated by squares, there exists a special type of Lie digroup with tangent
algebra isomorphic to the given Leibniz algebra. The general coquecigrue
problem remains open, but Lie racks seem to be a promising direction.

that option price and random arbitrage returns change on different time scales
which allows us to develop an asymptotic pricing theory involving the central
limit theorem for random processes. We restrict ourselves to finding pricing

shown to be independent of the detailed statistical characteristics of the

the different behaviour of the symmetry energy in different models. To clarify
this issue, we make a systematic and careful analysis based on new Skyrme
forces which span a wide range of values for $K_\infty$, for the value of the
symmetry energy at saturation and for its density dependence. By calculating,
in a fully self-consistent fashion, the ISGMR centroid energy in $^{208}$Pb we
reach, for the first time within the non-relativistic framework, three
important conclusions: (i) the monopole energy, and consequently the deduced
value of $K_\infty$, depend on a well defined parameter related to the shape of
the symmetry energy curve and called $K_{sym}$; (ii) Skyrme forces of the type
of SLy4 predict $K_\infty$ around 230 MeV, in agreement with the Gogny force
(previous estimates using Skyrme interactions having been plagued by lack of
full self-consistency); (iii) it is possible to build forces which predict
$K_\infty$ around 250 MeV, although part of this increase is due to our poor
knowledge of the density dependence and effective mass.

is non-additive. These probabilities, on the other hand, may be determined by
the limit of relative frequency of measured events, which are by nature
additive. We demonstrate that there are only two ways to resolve this problem.
The first solution places emphasis on the precise use of the concept of
conditional probability for successive measurements. The physically correct
conditional probabilities define additive probabilities for two-time
measurements. These probabilities depend explicitly on the resolution of the
physical device and do not, therefore, correspond to a function of the
associated projection operators. It follows that quantum theory distinguishes
between physical events and propositions about events, the latter are not
represented by projection operators and that the outcomes of two-time
experiments cannot be described by quantum logic.
  The alternative explanation is rather radical: it is conceivable that the
relative frequencies for two-time measurements do not converge, unless a
particular consistency condition is satisfied. If this is true, a strong
revision of the quantum mechanical formalism may prove necessary. We stress
that it is possible to perform experiments that will distinguish the two
alternatives.

first examining the theory experiment connection. The role of an implied theory
hierarchy and use of computers in comparing theory and experiment is described.
The main idea of the paper is to tighten the theory experiment connection by
bringing physical theories, as mathematical structures over C, the complex
numbers, closer to what is actually done in experimental measurements and
computations. The method replaces C by C_{n} which is the set of pairs,
R_{n},I_{n}, of n figure rational numbers in some basis. The properties of
these numbers are based on the type of numbers that represent measurement
outcomes for continuous variables. A model of space and time based on R_{n} is
discussed. The model is scale invariant with regions of constant step size
interrupted by exponential jumps. A method of taking the limit n to infinity to
obtain locally flat continuum based space and time is outlined. Possibly the
most interesting result is that R_{n} based space is invariant under scale
transformations which correspond to expansion and contraction of space relative
to a flat background. Also the location of the origin, which is a space and
time singularity, does not change under these transformations. Some properties
of quantum mechanics based on C_{n} and on R_{n} space are briefly
investigated.

quantum state of the qubit received by the receiver. Such classical feedback
doubles capacities of certain memoryless quantum channels without preexisting
entanglement between transmitter and receiver. The increase in capacity, which
is absent on classical memoryless channels, occurs because we can transform an
entangled qubit pair into any other entangled state by applying a unitary
operator to only one of the qubits.

quantity over a collection of quantum systems. We show that previous results
obtained for infinite ensemble of identically prepared systems lead to
incorrect conclusions for finite ensembles. In particular, exact measurement of
a macroscopic observable significantly disturbs the state of any finite
ensemble. However, we show how this disturbance can be made arbitrarily small
when the measurement are of finite accuracy. We demonstrate a tradeoff between
state disturbance and measurement coarseness as a function of the size of the
ensemble. Using this tradeoff, we show that the histories generated by any
sequence of finite accuracy macroscopic measurements always generate a
consistent family in the absence of large scale entanglement, for sufficiently
large ensembles. Hence, macroscopic observables behave ""classically"" provided
that their accuracy is coarser than the quantum correlation length-scale of the
system. The role of these observable is also discussed in the context of NMR
quantum information processing and bulk ensemble quantum state tomography.

that these angles, a classical concept, can arise naturally in quantum systems.

  entanglement and local unitary operations",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  A deterministic direct quantum communication protocol by using swapping
quantum entanglement and local unitary operations is proposed in this paper. A
set of ordered EPR pairs in one of the four Bell states is used. For each pair,
each of the two legitimate users owns a photon of the entangled pair via
quantum channel. The pairs are divided into two types of group, i.e., the
checking groups and the encoding-decoding groups. In the checking groups,
taking advantage of the swapping quantum entanglement and Alice's (the message
sender's) public announcement, the eavesdropping can be detected provided that
the number of the checking groups is big enough. After insuring the security of
the quantum channel, Alice encodes her bits via the local unitary operations on
the encoding-decoding groups. Then she performs her Bell measurements on her
photons and publicly announces her measurement results. After her announcement,
the message receiver Bob performs his Bell measurements on his photons and
directly extracts the encoding bits by using the property of the quantum
entanglement swapping. The security of the present scheme is also discussed:
under the attack scenarios to our best knowledge, the scheme is secure.
