  conclusions","Astrophys.J. 609 (2004) L9-L12","10.1086/422516",,"astro-ph",,"  SN 2001em, identified as a Type Ic supernova, has recently been detected in
the radio and X-rays, $\gtrsim$ 2 yr after the explosion. The high luminosities
at such late times might arise from a relativistic jet viewed substantially
off-axis that becomes visible only when it turns mildly relativistic and its
emission is no longer strongly beamed away from us. Alternatively, the emission
might originate from the interaction of the SN shell with the circumstellar
medium. We find that the latter scenario is hard to reconcile with the observed
rapid rise in the radio flux and optically thin spectrum,
$F_\nu\propto\nu^{-0.36\pm 0.16}t^{1.9\pm 0.4}$, while these features arise
naturally from a misaligned relativistic jet. The high X-ray luminosity
provides an independent and more robust constraint -- it requires $\sim
10^{51}$ erg in mildly relativistic ejecta. The source should therefore
currently have a large angular size ($\sim$ 2 mas) which could be resolved in
the radio with VLBA. It is also expected to be bipolar and is thus likely to
exhibit a large degree of linear polarization ($\sim 10%-20%$). The presence of
a relativistic outflow in SN 2001em would have interesting implications. It
would suggest that several percent of SNe Ib/c produce mildly relativistic
jets, with an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0\gtrsim 2$, while the fraction
that produce GRB jets (with $\Gamma_0\gtrsim 100$) is $\sim 100$ times smaller.
This could considerably increase the expected number of transients similar to
orphan GRB afterglows in the radio, and to a lesser extent in the optical and
X-rays, if there is a continuous distribution in $\Gamma_0$. Furthermore, this
may give further credence to the idea that core collapse SNe, and in particular
SNe Type Ib/c, are triggered by bipolar jets.

its host galaxy from 1-100 days after the burst. In spite of the high
extinction to the source and the bright host, a significant increase and
subsequent decrease has been detected in the apparent brightness of the host,
peaking between 10 and 33 days after the GRB. The only convincing explanation
is a supernova (SN) associated with the XRF, SN2003lw. This is the earliest
time at which a SN signal is clearly discernible in a GRB/XRF (apart from
SN1998bw). SN2003lw is extremely luminous with a broad peak and can be
approximately represented by the lightcurve of SN1998bw brightened by ~0.55
mag, implying a hypernova, as observed in most GRB-SNe. The XRF-SN association
firmly links XRFs with the deaths of massive stars and further strengthens
their connection with GRBs. The fact that SNe are also associated with XRFs
implies that Swift may detect a significant population of intermediate redshift
SNe very soon after the SN explosions, a sample ideally suited for detailed
studies of early SN physics.

galaxy UGC10043. B & R imaging reveals that the inner bulge of UGC10043 is
elongated perpendicular to the major axis. At larger r, the bulge isophotes
twist to become oblate and nearly circular, suggesting the bulge is triaxial.
Based on stellar and ionized gas kinematics, the bulge shows no clear evidence
for rotation about either its major or minor axis. The southwestern quadrant of
the bulge is girdled by a narrow dust lane parallel to the minor axis that may
be part of an inner polar ring. The stellar disk of UGC10043 has a low optical
surface brightness, a small scale height, a mild integral sign warp, and a
dusty, inner region that appears tilted relative to the outlying disk. The HA
and [NII] emission lines in UGC10043 resolve into multiple velocity components,
indicating the presence of a large-scale galactic wind with an outflow velocity
of ~104 km/s. HA+[NII] imaging reaffirms this picture by revealing ionized gas
extended to |z|~3.5kpc in a biconical structure. The [NII]/HA line intensity
ratio increases with increasing distance from the plane, reaching values as
high as 1.7. Unlike most galaxies with large-scale winds, UGC10043 has only a
modest global star formation rate (~1M_sun/yr), implying the wind is powered by
a rather feeble central starburst. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could
account for both the structural complexities of UGC10043 and its large-scale
wind. [Abridged]

segregation of galaxies has evolved over the last 8 Gyr. Although the
morphology-density relation, as described by the fraction of early-type (E+S0)
galaxies, was in place at z=1, its form differs from that observed at both z=0
and z=0.5. In the highest density regions the early-type fraction has increased
steadily with time from f(E+S0)=0.7+/-0.1 at z=1 to f(E+S0)=0.9+/-0.1 at the
present epoch. However, in intermediate density regions corresponding to groups
and the accretion regions of rich clusters, significant evolution appears to
begin only after z=0.5. Finally, at the lowest densities, no evolution is
observed for the early-type fraction of field galaxies which remains constant
at f(E+S0)=0.4+/-0.1 at all epochs. We examine a simple picture consistent with
these observations where the early-type population at z=1 is comprised largely
of elliptical galaxies. Subsequent evolution in both intermediate and dense
regions is attributed to the transformation of spirals into lenticulars.
Further progress in verifying our hypothesis may be achieved through
distinguishing ellipticals and lenticulars at these redshifts through resolved
dynamical studies of representative systems.

the framework of the disk-corona evaporation/condensation model. Assuming an
inactive disk, a hot corona should form above the disk since there is a
continuous supply of hot gas from stellar winds of the close-by massive stars.
Whether the cool disk can survive depends on the mass exchange between the disk
and corona. If the disk-corona interaction is dominated by evaporation and the
rate is larger than the Bondi accretion rate in the Galactic Center, the disk
will be depleted within a certain time period and no persistent disk will
exist. On the other hand, if the interaction results in hot gas steadily
condensing into the disk, an inactive cool disk might survive. For this case we
further investigate the Bremsstrahlung radiation from the hot corona and
compare it with the observed X-ray luminosity. Our model shows that, for
standard viscosity in the corona (alpha=0.3), the mass evaporation rate is much
higher than the Bondi accretion rate and the coronal density is much larger
than that inferred from Chandra observations. An inactive disk can not survive
such strong evaporation. For small viscosity (alpha<0.07) we find condensation
solutions. But detailed computations show that in this case there is too much
X-ray radiation from the corona to be in agreement with the observations.
Therefore, we conclude that there should be no thin/inactive disk presently in
the Galactic Center. However, we do not exclude that the alternative
non-radiative model of Nayakshin (2004) might instead be realized in nature.

find that the spectra of the point sources near the Galactic center are very
hard between 2--8 keV, even after accounting for absorption. When modeled as
power laws the median photon index is Gamma=0.7, while when modeled as thermal
plasma we can only obtain lower limits to the temperature of kT>8 keV. The
combined spectra of the point sources is similarly hard, with a photon index of
Gamma=0.8. Strong line emission is observed from low-ionization, He-like, and
H-like Fe, both in the average spectra and in the brightest individual sources.
The line ratios of the highly-ionized Fe in the average spectra are consistent
with emission from a plasma in thermal equilibrium. This line emission is
observed whether average spectra are examined as a function of the count rate
from the source, or as a function of the hardness ratios of individual sources.
This suggests that the hardness of the spectra may in fact to due local
absorption that partially-covers the X-ray emitting regions in the Galactic
center systems. We suggest that most of these sources are intermediate polars,
which (1) often exhibit hard spectra with prominent Fe lines, (2) rarely
exhibit either flares on short time scales or changes in their mean X-ray flux

They also reveal a population of quasars with moderate obscuration at both
visible and X-ray wavelengths. We use Chandra selected samples of quasars from
the ELAIS Deep X-ray Survey (EDXS) and CDF-N to investigate the obscuration
towards the nuclei of moderately obscured AGN. We find an inverse correlation
between the optical to X-ray flux ratio and the X-ray hardness ratio which can
be interpreted as due to obscuration at visible and X-ray wavelengths. We
present detailed optical and near-infrared data for a sample of optically-faint
(R>23) quasars from the EDXS. These are used to constrain the amount of
rest-frame UV/optical reddening towards these quasars. It is found that
optically-faint quasars are mostly faint due to obscuration, not because they
are intrinsically weak. After correcting for reddening, the optical magnitudes
of most of these quasars are similar to the brighter quasars at these X-ray
fluxes. Combining with gas column densities inferred from the X-ray
observations we consider the gas-to-dust ratios of the obscuring matter. We
find that the quasars generally have higher gas-to-dust absorption than that
seen in the Milky Way - similar to what has been found for nearby Seyfert
galaxies. We consider the possible existence of a large population of X-ray
sources which have optical properties of Type 1 (unobscured) quasars, but X-ray
properties of Type 2 (obscured) quasars. We show that the observed distribution
of optical-to-X-ray flux ratios of quasars at z>1 is skewed to low values
compared to the intrinsic distribution...

resolution of 15.2"" x 14.4"" and a velocity resolution of 2.6km/s. The HI has
been traced out to a radius R~8R_25 or 48 disc scale-lengths, making it one of
the largest HI extents reported (800"" or 12.6kpc at the assumed distance of
3.3Mpc). Approximately 75% of the HI resides in a doughnut which is seen close
to face-on and the optical galaxy fits snugly within the hole of the doughnut.
The remaining 25% of the neutral gas is found in an annulus concentric with the
doughnut and with a somewhat larger ellipticity. A total HI mass of 1.52 x 10^8
Msol is found, which implies an M(HI)/L_B = 0.22 in solar units. We argue that
most if not all of this gas is of external origin, most likely due to the
merger of a dwarf irregular galaxy with M_B ~ -15.5mag.
  The velocity field shows a steeply declining observed rotation curve,
compatible with Keplerian decline. However, because the galaxy is close to
face-on there is a degeneracy in the determination of the intrinsic rotation
curve and inclination. We therefore analysed two extreme cases, producing
tilted-ring model fits forcing either a Keplerian or a Flat rotation curve
through the observations; both approaches result in equally plausible fits.
  Assuming a distance of 3.3Mpc, a total mass of 3 x 10^10 Msol is found on the
basis of the Keplerian rotation curve. This implies a global M/L_B ratio of ~44
in solar units which is high and likely a reflection of the low blue luminosity
of the galaxy (~15 times lower than the average S0 luminosity). Values for a
Flat rotation curve are a factor of 4 higher.

X-ray binaries, the presence of a cold, thin disk can be inferred from
signatures of reprocessing in the ~2-50 keV band. The strength of this
signature is dependent on the source spectrum and flux impinging on the disk
surface, and is thus very sensitive to the system geometry. The general
weakness of this feature in the hard state has been attributed to either a
truncation of the thin disk, large ionization, or beaming of the corona region
away from the disk with \beta~0.3. This latter velocity is comparable to jet
nozzle velocities, so we explore whether a jet can account for the observed
reflection fractions. It has been suggested that jets may contribute to the
high-energy spectra of X-ray binaries, via either synchrotron from around
100-1000 r_g along the jet axis or from inverse Compton (synchrotron
self-Compton and/or external Compton) from near the base. Here we calculate the
reflection fraction from jet models wherein either synchrotron or Compton
processes dominate the emission. Using as a guide a data set for GX 339-4,
where the reflection fraction previously has been estimated as ~10%, we study
the results for a jet model. We find that the synchrotron case gives < 2%
reflection, while a model with predominantly synchrotron self-Compton in the
base gives ~10-18%. This shows for the first time that an X-ray binary jet is
capable of significant reflection fractions, and that extreme values of the
reflection may be used as a way of discerning the dominant contributions to the
X-ray spectrum.

supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in Galactic molecular gas generates
strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most
massive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.
  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at
the same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately
linked to the dynamical behavior of parental gas cloud, which determines when
and where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via
accretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. Slow,
inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support,
whereas fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence.
  The fact that Galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary can be
explained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. The dynamical
evolution of nascent star clusters is very complex. This strongly influences
the stellar mass spectrum. The equation of state (EOS) plays a pivotal role in
the fragmentation process. Under typical cloud conditions, massive stars form
as part of dense clusters. However, for gas with effective polytropic index
greater than unity star formation becomes biased towards isolated massive
stars, which may be of relevance for understanding Pop III stars.

complex morphologies. A new method is developed to quantify the reliability of
each pixel in the color map without any bias against very red or blue color
regions.Based on analyses of two-dimensional structure and spatially resolved
color distribution, we carried out morphological classification for LIRGs.
About 36% of the LIRGs were classified as disk galaxies and 22% as irregulars.
Only 6 (17%) systems are obvious ongoing major mergers. An upper limit of 58%
was found for the fraction of mergers in LIRGs with all the possible
merging/interacting systems included. Strikingly, the fraction of compact
sources is as high as 25%, similar to that found in optically selected samples.
  From their K band luminosities, LIRGs are relatively massive systems, with an
average stellar mass of about 1.1x10^11 solar mass. They are related to the
formation of massive and large disks, from their morphologies and also from the
fact that they represent a significant fraction of distant disks selected by
their sizes. The compact LIRGs show blue cores, which could be associated with
the formation of the central region of these galaxies. We suggest that there
are many massive disks still forming a large fraction of their stellar mass
since z=1. For most of them, their central parts (bulge?) were formed prior to
the formation of their disks.

renormalized by Gutzwiller projection factors which allows us to gauge the

the current correlations on a number of external parameters: bias voltage,
magnetic field and magnetization of the leads. When the Kondo resonance is
split by fixing the voltage bias between two leads, the shot noise shows a
nontrivial dependence on the voltage applied to the third lead. We show that
the cross correlations of the current are more sensitive than the conductance
to the appearance of an external magnetic field. When the leads are
ferromagnetic and their magnetizations point along opposite directions, we find
a reduction of the cross correlations. Moreover, we report on the effect of
dephasing in the Kondo state for a two-terminal geometry when the third lead
plays the role of a fictitious voltage probe.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.70.051312",,"cond-mat.soft",,"  The dynamics of a set of rods bouncing on a vertically vibrated plate is
investigated using experiments, simulations, and theoretical analysis. The
experiments and simulations are performed within an annulus to impose periodic
boundary conditions. Rods tilted with respect to the vertical are observed to
spontaneously develop a horizontal velocity depending on the acceleration of
the plate. For high plate acceleration, the rods are observed to always move in
the direction of tilt. However, the rods are also observed to move opposite to
direction of tilt for a small range of plate acceleration and rod tilt. A phase
diagram of the observed motion is presented as a function of plate acceleration
and the tilt of the rods which is varied by changing the number of rods inside
the annulus. Next we introduce a novel molecular dynamics method to simulate
the dynamics of the rods using the dimensions and dissipation parameters from
the experiments. We reproduce the observed horizontal rod speeds as a function
of rod tilt and plate acceleration in the simulations. By decreasing the
friction between the rods and the base plate to zero in the simulation, we
identify the friction during the collision as the crucial ingredient for
occurrence of the horizontal motion. Guided by the data from the experiments
and the simulations, we construct a mechanical model for the dynamics of the
rods in the limit of thin rods. The starting point of the analysis is the
collision of a single rod with an oscillating plate. Three friction regimes are
identified: slide, slip-stick, and slip reversal. A formula is derived for the
observed horizontal velocity as a function of tilt angle. Good agreement for
the horizontal velocity as a function of rod tilt and plate acceleration is
found between experiments, simulations and theory.

between the Kondo regime, typically associated with single electron occupancy,

equivalent to a two level-level system coupled to an Ohmic bath, with a bias
controlled by the applied magnetic field. Due to the Kondo screening, the

the degree ord=mu -2. If the system is prepared at time -ta<0$ and the

martensite forming upon cooling from the high-temperature austenitic state
[5-layered (5M) martensite], and the martensite forming upon the
intermartensitic transition [7-layered (7M) martensite] strongly affects the
magnetic and transport properties of the alloy and results in a large thermal
hysteresis of the resistivity $\rho$ and magnetization $M$. The
intermartensitic transition has an especially marked influence on the transport
properties, as is evident from a large difference in the resistivity of the 5M

_{\mathrm{5M}} \approx 15%$, which is larger than the jump of resistivity at
the martensitic transition from the cubic austenitic phase to the monoclinic 5M

surface. It is also suggested that the nesting hypothesis can explain the

sequential tunneling regime. In the voltage-bias configuration chosen here, the
circuit is operated like a beam splitter, i.e. one lead is used as an input and
the other two as outputs. In the limit where a double occupancy of the dot is
not possible, a super-Poissonian Fano factor of the current in the input lead
and positive cross-correlations between the current fluctuations in the two
output leads can be obtained, due to dynamical channel-blockade. When a single
orbital of the dot transports current, this effect can be obtained by lifting
the spin-degeneracy of the circuit with ferromagnetic leads or with a magnetic
field. When several orbitals participate in the electronic conduction, lifting
spin-degeneracy is not necessary. In all cases, we show that a super-Poissonian
Fano factor for the input current is not equivalent to positive
cross-correlations between the outputs. We identify the conditions for
obtaining these two effects and discuss possible experimental realizations.

Jastrow-Slater wave functions for which the energy is stationary with respect
to the simultaneous optimization of orbitals and configuration interaction
coefficients. The approach is within the framework of the so-called energy
fluctuation potential method which minimizes the energy in an iterative fashion
based on Monte Carlo sampling and a fitting of the local energy fluctuations.
The optimization of the orbitals is combined with the optimization of the
configuration interaction coefficients through the use of additional single
excitations to a set of external orbitals. A new set of orbitals is then
obtained from the natural orbitals of this enlarged configuration interaction
expansion. For excited states, the approach is extended to treat the average of
several states within the same irreducible representation of the pointgroup of
the molecule. The relationship of our optimization method with the stochastic
reconfiguration technique by Sorella et al. is examined. Finally, the
performance of our approach is illustrated with the lowest states of ethene, in
particular with the difficult case of the singlet 1B_1u state.

high momentum states with the bulk of hadrons in the late fireball might
substantially account for the attenuation of the high transverse momentum
hadrons at RHIC. The potential hadronic attenuation has therefore to be
addressed in further detail before definite conclusions on possible QCD effects
in a deconfined QGP phase can be drawn with respect to the materializing jets.
  From our transport studies we find that the interactions of fully formed
hadrons are practically negligible in central Au+Au collisions at \sqrt s = 200
GeV for $p_\perp\geq 6 GeV$, but have some importance for the shape of the
ratio $R_{AA}$ at lower $p_\perp$ ($\leq 6 GeV$). However, a significant part
of the large suppression seen experimentally is attributed to inelastic
interactions of 'leading' jet-like pre-hadrons with the dense hadronic
environment. In addition, we also show within this scenario first (preliminary)
results of near-side and far-side correlations of high $p_\perp$ particles from
central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. It turns out that the
near-side correlations are unaltered -- in accordance with experiment --
whereas the far-side correlations are suppressed by $\sim$ 60%. Since the
experimental observation is a nearly complete disappearance of the far-side jet
there should be some additional and earlier partonic interactions in the dense
and possibly colored medium.

factorization(QCDF) method in charmless two-body nonleptonic $B$ meson decays.
We use the ratio of the branching fraction of $B^+ \to \pi^+ K^{\ast 0}$ to
that of $B^0 \to \pi^- \rho^+$, for which the theoretical uncertainties are
greatly reduced, to show clearly that the power corrections in charmless B
decays are probably large. With other similar ratios considered, for example,
for the $B^0 \to K^- \rho^+$ decay, it is very likely that, among various
sources of power corrections, annihilation topology plays an indispensable role
at least for penguin dominated $\rm PV$ channels. We also consider some
selective ratios of direct CP asymmetries. Among these, we find that, if power
corrections other than the chirally enhanced power corrections and annihilation
topology were negligible, QCDF would predict the direct CP asymmetry of $B \to
\pi^+ \pi^-$ to be about 3 times larger than that of $B \to \pi^\pm K^\mp$,
with opposite sign. Experimentally any significant deviation from this
prediction would suggest either new physics or possibly the importance of

of inner symmetries gives rise to a category GLoc A of twisted representations.
This category is a braided crossed G-category in the sense of Turaev. Its
degree zero subcategory is braided and equivalent to the usual representation
category Rep A. Combining this with [29], where Rep A was proven to be modular
for a nice class of rational conformal models, and with the construction of
invariants of G-manifolds in [60], we obtain an equivariant version of the
following chain of constructions: Rational CFT -> modular category ->
3-manifold invariant.
  We then study the relation between GLoc A and the braided (in the usual
sense) representation category Rep A^G of the orbifold theory A^G. We prove the
equivalence Rep A^G = (GLoc A)^G, which is a rigorous implementation of the
insight that one needs to take the twisted representations of A into account in
order to determine Rep A^G. In the opposite direction we have GLoc A = Rep A^G
\rtimes S, where S \subset Rep A^G is the full subcategory of representations
of A^G contained in the vacuum representation of A, and \rtimes refers to the
Galois extensions of braided tensor categories of [44,48].
  If A is completely rational and G is finite we prove that A has g-twisted
representations for every g in G. In the holomorphic case (where Rep A =
Vect_C) this allows to classify the possible categories GLoc A and to clarify
the role of the twisted quantum doubles D^\omega(G) in this context, as will be
done in a sequel. We conclude with some remarks on non-holomorphic orbifolds
and surprising counterexamples concerning permutation orbifolds.

We have studied the particular case of a polytropic equation of state and
assumed that the charge distribution is proportional to the mass density. The
charged stars have large mass and radius as we should expect due to the effect
of the repulsive Coulomb force with the M/R ratio increasing with charge. In
the limit of the maximum charge the mass goes up to ~ 10 M_sun which is much
higher than the maximum mass allowed for a neutral compact star. However, the
local effect of the forces experienced by a single charged particle, makes it
to discharge quickly. This creates a global force imbalance and the system

a highly secret key S. We show that, even if an adversary holds quantum

Additionally, we give an asymptotically optimal lower bound on the length of

Our result has applications in quantum cryptography. In particular, it implies

of a six-dimensional real Euclidean vector space naturally allows one to
construct the special unitary group on a two-qubit (quantum bit) Hilbert space,
in a fashion similar to that used in the well-established Bloch sphere model
for a single qubit. This is then used to illustrate the Cartan decompositions

077903 (2001)] that continuous-variable quantum teleportation at optical
frequencies has not been achieved because the source used (a laser) was not
`truly coherent'. Van Enk, and Fuchs [Phys. Rev. Lett, {\bf 88}, 027902
(2002)], while arguing against Rudolph and Sanders, also accept that an
`absolute phase' is achievable, even if it has not been achieved yet. I will
argue to the contrary that `true coherence' or `absolute phase' is always
illusory, as the concept of absolute time (at least for frequencies beyond
direct human experience) is meaningless. All we can ever do is to use an agreed
time standard. In this context, a laser beam is fundamentally as good a `clock'
as any other. I explain in detail why this claim is true, and defend my
argument against various objections. In the process I discuss super-selection
rules, quantum channels, and the ultimate limits to the performance of a laser
as a clock. For this last topic I use some earlier work by myself [Phys. Rev. A
{\bf 60}, 4083 (1999)] and Berry and myself [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 65}, 043803

hydrogen atom in parallel static and microwave electric fields. Using an
appropriate representation and averaging approximations we show that resonant
ionisation is controlled by a separatrix, and provide necessary conditions for
a dynamical resonance to affect the ionisation probability.
  The position of the dynamical resonance is computed using a high-order
perturbation series, and estimate its radius of convergence. We show that the
position of the dynamical resonance does not coincide precisely with the
ionisation maxima, and that the field switch-on time can dramatically affect
the ionisation signal which, for long switch times, reflects the shape of an
incipient homoclinic. Similarly, the resonance ionisation time can reflect the
time-scale of the separatrix motion, which is therefore longer than
conventional static field Stark ionisation. We explain why these effects should
be observed in the quantum dynamics.

where the user only needs b bits from each of the two l-bit answers, unknown to
the servers, satisfies t = Omega(n/(2^b Sum_{i=0}^b {l choose i})). This
implies that several known PIR schemes are close to optimal. Our results
generalize those of Goldreich et al. who proved roughly the same bounds for
linear LDCs and PIRs. Like earlier work by Kerenidis and de Wolf, our classical
lower bounds are proved using quantum computational techniques. In particular,
we give a tight analysis of how well a 2-input function can be computed from a
quantum superposition of both inputs.

that its Cartan involution is type AIII, given n is greater than 2. The
standard type AIII involution produces the Cosine-Sine Decomposition (CSD), a
well-known decomposition in numerical linear algebra which may be computed
using mature, stable algorithms. In the course of our proof that the KGD is
type AIII, we further establish the following. Khaneja and Glaser allow for a
particular degree of freedom, namely the choice of a commutative algebra a, in
their construction. Let SWAP denote a swap between qubits 1 and n. Then for
appropriate choice of a, the KGD by (SWAP v SWAP)=k1 a k2 may be recovered from
a CSD by v = (SWAP k1 SWAP) (SWAP a SWAP) (SWAP k2 SWAP).
