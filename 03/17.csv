three AGN are well fitted by absorbed powerlaws, with intrinsic nuclear
photoelectric absorption from column densities between 1.3 and 4.0e21 cm-2. In
the brightest object the X-ray spectrum is good enough to show that the
absorber is not significantly ionized. For all three objects the powerlaw
slopes appear to be somewhat flatter (Gamma~1.3-1.6) than those found in
typical unabsorbed Seyferts. The constraints from optical and X-ray emission
lines imply that all three objects are Compton-thin. For the two fainter
objects, the reddening deduced from the optical broad emission lines in one of
them, and the optical continuum in the other, are similar to those expected
from the X-ray absorption, if we assume a Galactic gas-to-dust ratio and
reddening curve. The broad line region Balmer decrement of our brightest object
is larger than expected from its X-ray absorption, which can be explained
either by an intrinsic Balmer decrement with standard gas-to-dust ratio, or by
a >Galactic gas-to-dust ratio. These >=Galactic ratios of extinction to
photoelectric absorption cannot extend to the high redshift, high luminosity,
broad line AGN in our sample, because they have column densities >1e22 cm-2,
and so their broad line regions would be totally obscured. This means that some
effect (e.g., luminosity dependence, or evolution) needs to be present in order
to explain the whole population of absorbed AGN.

in central regions of galactic disks. Therefore, we performed two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations for flat multi-component disks embedded in a stellar

gas by a drag force depending on their velocity difference.
  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or
near to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.
In that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for a small range of
high azimuthal modes (m \sim 8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have similar
amplitudes resulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a
larger contrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas. The
dust peaks are frequently correlated with peaks of the gas distribution, but
they do not necessarily coincide with them. This leads to a large scatter in
the dust-to-gas ratios. The appearance of the dust is more cellular (i.e.
sometimes connecting different spiral features), whereas the gas is organized
in a multi-armed spiral structure.
  We found that an admixture of 2% dust (relative to the mass of the gas)
destabilizes gaseous disks substantially, whereas dust-to-gas ratios below 1%
have no influence on the evolution of the gaseous disk. For a high dust-to-gas
ratio of 10% the instabilities reach the saturation level already after 30 Myr.

objects in APM catalogues to obtain a sample of optically bright (R < 19.5),
radio faint (1.4-GHz flux density S_1.4 > 3 mJy) radio galaxies over large
areas on the sky. We find that redshift spikes, which represent large

a common phenomena in these surveys. Under the assumption of quasi-linear
structure formation theory and a canonical radio galaxy bias, the structures
represent ~ 4-5 sigma peaks in the primordial density field and their expected

increase in the radio galaxy bias with redshift. To investigate potential
mechanisms which have triggered the radio activity in these galaxies - and
hence may account for an increase in the bias of this population, we performed
imaging studies of the cluster environment of the radio galaxies in

reside preferentially at the edges of rich clusters. If radio galaxies are
preferentially triggered as they fall towards rich clusters then they would
effectively adopt the cluster bias.

background (CMB) polarization with the primary aim of developing the theory of
CMB polarization from inflationary gravitational waves, as well as some of the
related theory of weak gravitational lensing (cosmic shear) of CMB
polarization. We begin with production of polarization by Thomson scattering.
We then discuss tensor-harmonic analysis (the ``grad-curl'' or ``E-B''
decomposition) on a flat and full sky in some detail. The Boltzmann/Einstein
equations required to predict the CMB temperature/polarization pattern due to
primordial gravitational waves are derived. We show that gravitational waves
produce a curl component of the CMB polarization while density perturbations
(at linear order) do not. We then show how cosmic shear induces a curl
component from a curl-free surface of last scattering. We describe, though in
less detail, how higher-order correlations can be used to subtract the
cosmic-shear--induced curl. Several exercises are provided.

  It is of great interest to understand how the current uncertainty on the

In particular, the mass of a core of heavy elements (other than H and He) and
the total mass of those heavy elements in these two planets are quite sensitive
to the EOS of hydrogen and constitute important clues to their formation
process. We present a study of the range of structures allowed for Jupiter and

oscillations observed during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 13 of
approximately 70 accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries. Compelling
observations indicate that the oscillations are produced by surface brightness
patterns on the rapidly rotating neutron stars. However, it remains to be
understood (1) why the brightness patterns producing them persist for up to 15
s during an X-ray burst, whereas the burning should cover the entire surface in
less than 1 s, and (2) why the frequencies drift upward by about 5 Hz during
the course of the burst. These peculiarities can probably be explained by
taking into account the expansion of the surface layers caused by the burning,
zonal flows that form due to pressure gradients between the equator and poles,
and Rossby-Alfven modes that are excited in the surface ocean. Further progress
toward understanding how burning progresses on the surface of the neutron star
can be made with a next-generation X-ray timing mission, which would provide a
larger sample of sources with oscillations, detect sideband signals produced by
the spectrum of modes that should be excited in the neutron star ocean, and
measure harmonic structure in the profiles of the oscillations. These
observations would be crucial for measuring the distribution of the rotation
rates of neutron stars, the progression of unstable nuclear burning in the
accreted ocean, and the curvature of the space-time around the neutron star.

Perhaps the best-understood of all accretion disks are those in cataclysmic

lines intersect the null charge surface (NCS), is proposed to explain
$\gamma$-ray and radio emission from pulsars. The IAG can be an important
source for high-energy particles. The particles can radiate between the NCS and
the IAG. Some observational characteristics in both $\gamma$-ray and radio
bands, such as the $\gamma$-ray emission beams of Crab-like, Vela-like and
Geminga-like, can be reproduced by numerical method. It is predicted that the
view angle $\zeta$ should be larger than the inclination angle

possibility to be observed. Whether the inner annular gap (or cap) is sparking
(or free flow) depends on the surface binding energy of the pulsar. In stead of
neutron star models, the scenario of the IAG is favorable for bare strange star

spatial correlation emerges from the study of the angular correlation function
of the field: the angular correlation function (ACF) shows a clear signal on
scales of 0.5 - 5 arcmin, correlation angle in the 0.5-7 keV band theta =

fit our data in both total intensity and linear polarization. We conclude that
the jets in B2 0326+39 and B2 1553+24 are at angles of 64 +/- 5 deg and 7.7 +/-

kpc, although in B2 1553+24 this transition occurs much further from the
nucleus than in B2 0326+39 or 3C 31. The longitudinal emissivity profiles can
be divided into sections, each fit accurately by a power law; the indices of
these power laws decrease with distance from the nucleus. The magnetic fields
in both objects are dominated by the longitudinal component in the
high-velocity regions close to the nucleus and by the toroidal component
further out, but B2 0326+39 also has a significant radial component at large
distances, whereas B2 1553+24 does not. Simple adiabatic models fail to fit the
emissivity variations in the regions of high velocity but provide good
descriptions of the emissivity after the jets have decelerated. Given the small
angle to the line of sight inferred for B2 1553+24, there should be a
significant population of similar sources at less extreme orientations. Such
objects should have long (>200 kpc), straight, faint jets and we show that
their true sizes are likely to have been underestimated in existing images.

emerge from the incommensurate magnetic superlattice peaks. In the ordered
state, these excitations are similar to spin waves. Following these excitations
as a function of temperature, we find that there is relatively little change in
the {\bf Q}-integrated dynamical spin susceptibility for $\hbar\omega\sim10$

the low-temperature-orthorhombic (LTO) phase. The {\bf Q}-integrated signal at
lower energies changes more dramatically through these transitions, as it must
in a transformation from an ordered to a disordered state. We argue that the
continuous evolution through the transitions provides direct evidence that the
incommensurate spin excitations in the disordered state are an indicator of
dynamical charge stripes. An interesting feature of the thermal evolution is a
variation in the incommensurability of the magnetic scattering. Similar
behavior is observed in measurements on a single crystal of

intermediate-coupling regime. Imposing the universal-jump condition for an
accurately calculated $\rho_s$, together with thorough finite-size scaling
analyses (in the spirit of the phenomenological renormalization group) of

model for molecular conduction. The direction of the asymmetry depends on the
sign of the majority carriers in the molecule. For conduction through highest
occupied molecular orbitals (i.e. HOMO or p-type conduction), the current is
smaller for positive voltage on the stronger contact, while for conduction
through lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (i.e. LUMO or n-type conduction),
the sense of the asymmetry is reversed. Within an extended Huckel description
of the molecular chemistry and the contact microstructure (with two adjustable

diagrams are obtained in the whole thermodynamic space including the magnetic
field $H$ for a wide class of Ising fluid models with various ratios $R$ for
the strengths of magnetic to nonmagnetic Yukawa-like interactions. The
influence of varying the inverse screening lengths $z_1$ and $z_2$,
corresponding to the magnetic and nonmagnetic Yukawa parts of the potential, is
investigated too. It is shown that changes in $R$ as well as in $z_1$ and $z_2$
can lead to different topologies of the phase diagrams. In particular,
depending on the value of $R$, the critical temperature of the liquid-gas
transition either decreases monotonically, behaves nonmonotonically, or
increases monotonically with increasing $H$. The para-ferro magnetic transition
is also affected by changes in $R$ and the screening lengths. At H=0, the Ising
fluid maps onto a simple model of a symmetric nonmagnetic binary mixture. For
$H \to \infty$, it reduces to a pure nonmagnetic fluid. The results are
compared with available simulations and the predictions of other theoretical
methods. It is demonstrated, that the mean spherical approximation appears to
be more accurate compared with mean field theory, especially for systems with
short ranged attraction potentials (when $z_1$ and $z_2$ are large). In the Kac

has been achieved in atomic systems. Bose Einstein Condensates are superfluids
just like bosonic Helium is and all interacting bosonic fluids are expected to
be at low enough temperatures. One difference between the two systems is that
superfluid Helium exhibits roton excitations while Bose Einstein Condensates
have never been observed to have such excitations. The reason for the roton
minimum in Helium is its proximity to a solid phase. The roton minimum is a
consequence of enhanced density fluctuations at the reciprocal lattice vector
of the stillborn solid. Bose Einstein Condensates in atomic traps are not near
a solid phase and therefore do not exhibit roton minimum. We conclude that if
Bose Einstein Condensates in an optical lattice are tuned near a transition to
a Mott insulating phase, a roton minimum will develop at a reciprocal lattice
vector of the lattice. Equivalently, a peak in the structure factor will appear
at such a wavevector. The smallness of the roton gap or the largeness of the
structure factor peak are experimental signatures of the proximity to the Mott
transition.

used, because after irradiation of a Si ingot by the thermal neutron flux in a
nuclear reactor, this isotope transmutes into a phosphorus atom which is a
donor impurity in Si. Enrichment of Si with Si-30 allows one to increase the
level of doping up to a factor of 30 with a high homogeneity of the impurity
distribution. The second purpose is achieved in Si highly enriched with isotope
Si-28, because mono-isotopic Si is characterized by enhanced thermal
conductivity. New potential of isotopically engineered Si comes to light
because of novel areas of fundamental and applied scientific activity connected
with spintronics and a semiconductor-based nuclear spin quantum computer where
electron and/or nuclear spins are the object of manipulation. In this case,
control of the abundance of nuclear spins is extremely important. Fortunately,
Si allows such a control, because only isotope Si-29 has a non-zero nuclear
spin. Therefore, enrichment or depletion of Si with isotope Si-29 will lead to
the creation of a material with a controlled concentration of nuclear spins.
Two examples of nano-devices for spintronics and quantum computation, based on
isotopically engineered silicon, are discussed.

first distinguish between a weak field and a strong field approximation.
Indeed, the Weyl gravity does not turn off asymptotically and becomes even
stronger at larger distances.

torsion acts as a true gravitational force, quite similar to the Lorentz force
of electrodynamics. As a consequence, the right-hand side of a
spinless-particle equation of motion (which would represent a gravitational
force) is always zero in the geometric description, but not in the teleparallel

be minimal only in the geometric case. Relying on this property, a new
gravitational coupling prescription in the presence of curvature and torsion is
proposed. It is constructed in such a way to preserve the equivalence between
curvature and torsion, and its basic property is to be equivalent with the
usual coupling prescription of general relativity. According to this view, no
new physics is connected with torsion, which appears as a mere alternative to

procedure is adopted: we evolve, in axisymmetry, the linearized equations
describing metric and fluid perturbations, coupled with a nonlinear
hydrodynamics code that calculates the motion of the accreting matter. The
initial matter distribution is shaped in the form of extended quadrupolar
shells of dust or perfect fluid. Self--gravity and radiation reaction effects
of the accreting fluid are neglected. This idealized setup is used to
understand the qualitative features appearing in the energy spectrum of the
gravitational wave emission from compact stars or black holes, subject to
accretion processes involving extended objects. A comparison for the case of
point--like particles falling radially onto black holes is also provided. Our
results show that, when the central object is a black hole, the spectrum is far
from having only one clear, monochromatic peak at the frequency of the
fundamental quasi-normal mode, but it shows a complex pattern, with
interference fringes produced by the interaction between the infalling matter
and the underlying perturbed spacetime: most of the energy is emitted at
frequencies lower than that of the fundamental mode of the black hole. Similar
results are obtained for extended shells accreting onto neutron stars, but in
this case the stellar fundamental mode is clearly excited. Our analysis shows
that the gravitational wave signal driven by accretion is influenced more by
the details and dynamics of the process, than by the quasi--normal mode

argue that the well-known breakdown of a naive perturbative expansion at a low

different expansion -- the constrained perturbation theory -- in which the
breakdown does not occur and the theory is perturbatively tractable all the way
up to its natural ultraviolet cutoff. In this approach the couplings of the
extra polarizations to matter and their selfcouplings appear to be suppressed
and should be neglected in measurements at sub-horizon scales. The model
reproduces results of General Relativity at observable distances with high
accuracy, while predicting deviations from them at the present-day horizon
scale.

underlying Kac-Moody algebra assumes its critical value, equal to the dual
Coxeter number, in which case the central charge of the Virasoro algebra
becomes infinite. We examine this limit from the world-sheet and target space
viewpoint and show that gravity decouples naturally from the spectrum. Using
the two-dimensional black-hole coset SL(2,R)_k/U(1) as illustrative example, we
find for k=2 that the world-sheet symmetry is described by a truncated version
of W_{\infty} generated by chiral fields with integer spin s \geq 3, whereas
the Virasoro algebra becomes abelian and it can be consistently factored out.
The geometry of target space looks like an infinitely curved hyperboloid, which
invalidates the effective field theory description and conformal invariance can
no longer be used to yield reliable space-time interpretation. We also compare
our results with the null gauging of WZW models, which correspond to infinite
boost in target space and they describe the Liouville mode that decouples in
the tensionless limit. A formal BRST analysis of the world-sheet symmetry
suggests that the central charge of all higher spin generators should be fixed
to a critical value, which is not seen by the contracted Virasoro symmetry.
Generalizations to higher dimensional coset models are also briefly discussed
in the tensionless limit, where similar observations are made.

exploit this form of mirror symmetry. The examples of the quintic 3-fold, flops

multiple solutions for the depth of the square well. The depth can be chosen to
be a continuous function of the short-distance cutoff R, but it can also be a
log-periodic function of R with finite discontinuities, corresponding to a
renormalization group (RG) limit cycle. We consider the regularization with a
delta-shell potential. In this case, the coupling constant is uniquely
determined to be a log-periodic function of R with infinite discontinuities,
and an RG limit cycle is unavoidable. In general, a regularization with an RG
limit cycle is selected as the correct renormalization of the 1/r^2 potential
by the conditions that the cutoff radius R can be made arbitrarily small and
that physical observables are reproduced accurately at all energies much less

to be surprisingly difficult. It is remarkable that a rigorous proof of the
existence of the Lorenz attractor was presented only around the year 2000 with
a computer assisted proof together with an extension of the hyperbolic theory
developed to encompass attractors robustly containing equilibria. We present
some of the main results on the statisitcal behavior of such systems. We show
that for attractors of three-dimensional flows, robust chaotic behavior is
equivalent to the existence of certain hyperbolic structures, known as
singular-hyperbolicity. These structures, in turn, are associated to the
existence of physical measures: \emph{in low dimensions, robust chaotic
behavior for flows ensures the existence of a physical measure}. We then give
more details on recent results on the dynamics of singular-hyperbolic
(Lorenz-like) attractors.

  We present the basics of Ore localization of rings and modules in much
detail. Common practical techniques are studied as well. We also describe a
counterexample for a folklore test principle. Localization in negatively
filtered rings arising in deformation theory is presented. A new notion of the
differential Ore condition is introduced in the study of localization of
differential calculi.
  To aid the geometrical viewpoint, localization is studied with emphasis on
descent formalism, flatness, abelian categories of quasicoherent sheaves and
generalizations, and natural pairs of adjoint functors for sheaf and module
categories. The key motivational theorems from the seminal works of Gabriel on
localization, abelian categories and schemes are quoted without proof, as well
as the related statements of Popescu, Watts, Deligne and Rosenberg.
  The Cohn universal localization does not have good flatness properties, but
it is determined by the localization map already at the ring level. Cohn
localization is here related to the quasideterminants of Gelfand and Retakh;
and this may help understanding both subjects.

m = 1,2,... and m/n is not an integer. This paper constructs for each pair
(m,n) satisfying these conditions an irreducible S_N-module of singular
polynomials for the singular value -m/n. The module is of isotype
(n-1,(n1-1)^p,r) where n1 = n/gcd(m,n), r = N-n+1-p(n1-1) and 1 <= r <= n1-1

Jack polynomials. The paper presents some formulae for the action of Dunkl

dependence of poles (in the parameter) on the number of variables (N). Murphy

effects exhibited by sandstone bars in longitudinal resonance experiments.
Along with the fast subsystem of longitudinal nonlinear displacements we
examine the strain-dependent slow subsystem of broken intergrain and
interlamina cohesive bonds. We show that even the simplest but
phenomenologically correct modelling of their mutual feedback elucidates the
main experimental findings typical for forced longitudinal oscillations of
sandstone bars, namely, (i) hysteretic behavior of a resonance curve on both
its up- and down-slopes, (ii) linear softening of resonant frequency with
increase of driving level, and (iii) gradual recovery (increase) of resonant
frequency at low dynamical strains after the sample was conditioned by high
strains. In order to reproduce the highly nonlinear elastic features of
sandstone grained structure a realistic non-perturbative form of strain
potential energy was adopted. In our theory slow dynamics associated with the
experimentally observed memory of peak strain history is attributed to
strain-induced kinetic changes in concentration of ruptured inter-grain and
inter-lamina cohesive bonds causing a net hysteretic effect on the elastic
Young's modulus. Finally, we explain how enhancement of hysteretic phenomena
originates from an increase in equilibrium concentration of ruptured cohesive
bonds that are due to water saturation.

investigated for a qubit represented by the spin of an electron localized in a
self-assembled quantum dot. The localized electron wave function is evaluated
within the atomistic tight-binding model. The magnetic field generated by the
nuclear spins is estimated in the presence of an inhomogeneous environment
characterized by a random nuclear spin configuration, by the dot-size
distribution, by alloy disorder, and by interface disorder. Due to these
inhomogeneities, the magnitude of the nuclear magnetic field varies from one
qubit to another by the order of 100 G, 100 G, 10 G, and 0.1 G, respectively.
The fluctuation of the magnetic field causes errors in exchange operations due
to the inequality of the Zeeman splitting between two qubits. We show that the
errors can be made lower than the quantum error threshold if an exchange energy
larger than 0.1 meV is used for the operation.

  Revtex4, 6 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.70.022302",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider two different optimized measurement strategies for the
discrimination of nonorthogonal quantum states. The first is conclusive
discrimination with a minimum probability of inferring an erroneous result, and
the second is unambiguous, i. e. error-free, discrimination with a minimum
probability of getting an inconclusive outcome, where the measurement fails to
give a definite answer. For distinguishing between two mixed quantum states, we
investigate the relation between the minimum error probability achievable in
conclusive discrimination, and the minimum failure probability that can be
reached in unambiguous discrimination of the same two states. The latter turns
out to be at least twice as large as the former for any two given states. As an
example, we treat the case that the state of the quantum system is known to be,
with arbitrary prior probability, either a given pure state, or a uniform
statistical mixture of any number of mutually orthogonal states. For this case
we derive an analytical result for the minimum probability of error and perform
a quantitative comparison to the minimum failure probability.
