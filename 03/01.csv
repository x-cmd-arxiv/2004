representative of the composition of the underlying star. A minimum in
abundance is seen at a first ionization potential (FIP) of 7-8 eV, with
evidence for higher abundances at both lower and higher FIP, similar to
patterns seen in other active stars. From an analysis of the He-like triplet of

with respect to its temperature of 1.01 +/- 0.01 keV. Using the deprojected

0.11r_{200}, and then decreases inwards to 0.83 keV at the center and outwards

the best fit of the spectra, with ~ 20% volume occupied by the cool component.

unusual in several respects. (i) Its stellar initial mass function (IMF) peaks
at relatively high mass ($\sim 0.8 M_\odot$), but contains very few stars much
more massive than $1 M_\odot$, and is relatively deficient in brown dwarfs.
(ii) It has a higher binary fraction, particularly at large separations. (iii)
Its core mass function is strongly peaked at a few $M_\odot$, and the cores
have extended envelopes and relatively low levels of turbulence.
  We present here the results of an ensemble of hydrodynamic simulations which
suggest that the unusual stellar IMF in Taurus is a direct consequence of the
unusual properties of the cores there. By following the collapse and
fragmentation of cores having properties typical of Taurus, we find that
roughly 50% of the objects formed in a core, predominantly the low-mass ones,
are ejected from the core to form a population of low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs with a flat mass function. The remaining objects form multiple systems
within the core, accreting until their masses approach $1 M_\odot$; this
produces a population of intermediate-mass stars whose mass function peaks at
$\sim 0.8 M_\odot$. Together these two populations reproduce the IMF in Taurus
very well. This demonstrates, for the first time, a direct causal link between
the core mass function and the stellar IMF in a star formation region.

shown by previous two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with mirror symmetry
at the equator. The 3-D simulation ran over one hundred light-crossing time
units ($\tau_{\rm S} = r_{\rm S}/c$ where $r_{\rm S} \equiv 2GM/c^2$) which is
considerably longer than the previous simulations. We show that the jet is
initially formed as predicted due in part to magnetic pressure from the
twisting the initially uniform magnetic field and from gas pressure associated
with shock formation in the region around $r = 3 r_{\rm S}$. At later times,
the accretion disk becomes thick and the jet fades resulting in a wind that is
ejected from the surface of the thickened (torus-like) disk. It should be noted
that no streaming matter from a donor is included at the outer boundary in the
simulation (an isolated black hole not binary black hole). The wind flows
outwards with a wider angle than the initial jet. The widening of the jet is
consistent with the outward moving torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves (TAWs). This
evolution of disk-jet coupling suggests that the jet fades with a thickened
accretion disk due to the lack of streaming material from an accompanying star.

which two electric fields are used: The static direct current (DC) field of
high strength causing the dielectric nonlinearity, and the probing alternating
current (AC) field of low strength and high frequency. When a nonlinear
composite is subjected to a sinusoidal electric field, the electric response in
the composite will, in general, consist of AC fields at frequencies of
higher-order harmonics. Based on the Froehlich model, we present a theory to
investigate nonlinear AC responses of dipolar fluids containing both
polarizable monomers and dimers. In the case of monomers only, our theory
reproduces the known results. We obtain the fundamental, second-, and
third-order harmonics of the Froehlich field by performing a perturbation
expansion. The even-order harmonics are induced by the coupling between the AC
and DC fields although the system under consideration has a cubic nonlinearity
only. The harmonics of the Froehlich field can be affected by the field
frequency, temperature, dispersion strength and the characteristic frequency of
the dipolar fluid, as well as the dielectric constant of the nonpolar fluid.
The results are found to be in agreement with recent experimental observations.

(kinks) existed in the system. In this work, a collective coordinate approach
allows us to identify the mechanism through which the width oscillation drives
the kink and its relation with the mathematical symmetry conditions.
Furthermore, our theory predicts, and numerical simulations confirm, that the
direction of motion depends on the initial phase of the driving, while the
system behaves in a ratchet-like fashion if averaging over initial conditions.
Finally, the presence of noise overimposed to the ac driving does not destroy
the directed motion; on the contrary, it gives rise to an activation process
that increases the velocity of the motion. We conjecture that this could be a
signature of resonant phenomena at larger noises.

has become an accepted element of the successful `cosmic concordance' model.
However, there are many puzzling features of the resulting theory. It requires
both high energy and low energy inflation, with energy densities differing by a
hundred orders of magnitude. The questions of why the universe started out
undergoing high energy inflation, and why it will end up in low energy
inflation, are unanswered. Rather than resort to anthropic arguments, we have
developed an alternative cosmology, the Cyclic universe, in which the universe
exists in a very long-lived attractor state determined by the laws of physics.
The model shares inflation's phenomenological successes without requiring an
epoch of high energy inflation. Instead, the universe is made homogeneous and
flat, and scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations are generated during an epoch
of low energy acceleration like that seen today, but preceding the last big
bang. Unlike inflation, the model requires low energy acceleration in order for
a periodic attractor state to exist. The key challenge facing the scenario is
that of passing through the cosmic singularity at t=0. Substantial progress has
been made at the level of linearised gravity, which is reviewed here. The
challenge of extending this to nonlinear gravity and string theory remains.

Coulomb excitation $AuAu\to Au^*Au^*+e^+e^-$, in ultra-peripheral gold-gold

200$ GeV per nucleon. These reactions were selected by detecting neutron
emission by the excited gold ions in the Zero Degree Calorimeters. The charged

Chamber.
  The detector acceptance limits the kinematical range of the observed $e^+e^-$
pairs; therefore the measured cross-section is extrapolated to $4\pi$ with the
use of Monte Carlo simulations. We have developed a Monte Carlo simulation for
ultra-peripheral $e^+e^-$ production at RHIC based on the Equivalent Photon
Approximation, the lowest-order QED $e^+e^-$ production cross-section by two
real photons and the assumption that the mutual nuclear excitations and the \ee
production are independent (EPA model). %We present cross-section predictions
from this model in various kinematic regions.

based on full QED calculation of the \ee production, taking the photon
virtuality into account. The measured differential cross-section $d\sigma

region. The first one is the asymmetry in reaction with circularly polarized
photon beam and unpolarized deuteron target. The second one corresponds to
those with an unpolarized photon beam and polarized target. We find that the
two asymmetries have quite different energy dependence, and their shapes are
sensitive to the PNC-meson exchange coupling constants.

the isospin mixing depends on the symmetry energy and a stiff behaviour leads
to more transparency. The results are also nicely sensitive to the ""fine

support the introduction of the $\delta$ meson in the description of the
