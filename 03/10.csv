formation. In absence of spiral density waves, star formation occurs largely
stochastically. The scattered star-forming regions tend to be long-lived and
migrate slowly. Older populations have a spatially more extended and regular
distribution. In fast-rotating Irrs high star formation rates with stronger
concentration toward the galaxies' center are observed, and cluster formation
is facilitated. In slowly or nonrotating dwarf Irrs (dIrrs) star formation
occurs more quiescently, and the formation of OB associations is common. Irrs
and dIrrs tend to experience continuous star formation with amplitude
variations and to continue to form stars for another Hubble time. Irrs exhibit
lower effective yields than spirals, and [alpha/Fe] ratios below the solar
value. This may be indicative of fewer Type II SNe and lower astration rates in
their past. Alternatively, many metals may be lost from the shallow galaxy
potential wells due to selective winds. The differences in the
metallicity-luminosity relation between dIrrs and dwarf spheroidals (which,
despite their lower masses, tend to have too high a metallicity for their
luminosity as compared to dIrrs) further supports the idea of slow astration
and slow enrichment in dIrrs. The current data on age-metallicity relations are
still too sparse to distinguish between infall, leaky-box, and closed-box
models. The preferred location of dIrrs in the outer parts of galaxy groups and
clusters and in the field as well as the positive correlation between gas
content and distance from massive galaxies indicate that these dIrrs probably
have not yet experienced significant interactions or galaxy harassment.

imposed initial rotation profiles (1.25<P_0<8 s, where P_0 is the initial,
approximately solid-body, rotation period of the iron core). This range of P_0
covers the region of parameter space from where rotation begins to modify the
dynamics (P_0~8 s) to where angular velocities at collapse approach Keplerian
(P_0~1 s). Assuming strict angular momentum conservation, all models in this
range leave behind neutron stars with spin periods <10 ms, shorter than those
of most radio pulsars, but similar to those expected theoretically for
magnetars at birth. A fraction of the gravitational binding energy of collapse
is stored in the free energy of differential rotation. This energy source may
be tapped by viscous processes, providing a mechanism for energy deposition
that is not strongly coupled to the mass accretion rate through the stalled
supernova shock. This effect yields qualitatively new dynamics in models of
supernovae. We explore several potential mechanisms for viscosity in the
core-collapse environment: neutrino viscosity, turbulent viscosity caused by
the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and turbulent viscosity by entropy-
and composition-gradient-driven convection. We argue that the MRI is the most
effective. We find that for rotation periods in the range P_0<~5 s, and a range
of viscous stresses, that the post-bounce dynamics is significantly effected by
the inclusion of this extra energy deposition mechanism; in several cases we
obtain strong supernova explosions.

self-consistent 3D N-body simulations of bar-unstable disks are studied. Using
Gauss-Hermite polynomials to describe the stellar kinematics, a number of
characteristic bar signatures are identified in edge-on disks: 1) a major-axis
light profile with a quasi-exponential central peak and a plateau at moderate
radii (Freeman Type II profile); 2) a ``double-hump'' rotation curve; 3) a
sometime flat central velocity dispersion peak with a plateau at moderate radii
and occasional local central minimum and secondary peak; 4) an h3-V correlation
over the projected bar length. All those kinematic features are spatially
correlated and can easily be understood from the orbital structure of barred
disks. They thus provide a reliable and easy-to-use tool to identify edge-on
bars. Interestingly, they are all produced without dissipation and are
increasingly realized to be common in spirals, lending support to bar-driven
evolution scenarios for bulge formation. So called ``figure-of-eight''
position-velocity diagrams are never observed, as expected for realistic
orbital configurations. Although not uniquely related to triaxiality,
line-of-sight velocity distributions with a high velocity tail (i.e. an h3-V
correlation) appear as particularly promising tracers of bars. The stellar
kinematic features identified grow in strength as the bar evolves and vary
little for small inclination variations. Many can be used to trace the bar
length. Comparisons with observations are encouraging and support the view that
boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are simply thick bars viewed edge-on.

In this work, we investigate some observational constraints on a scenario in
which this modification is given by $H^2 = {8\pi G \over 3} (\rho +C\rho^n)$.
We mainly focus our attention on the constraints from recent measurements of
the dimensionless coordinate distances to type Ia supernovae and Fanaroff-Riley

and $\Omega_m=0.30^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, at the 95.4% confidence level, which is
consistent within the errors with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. These

technique are well-resolved images of background galaxies out to large
distances. As a concrete example of the surveys that will become available by
the end of the decade, we consider the planned Supernova/Acceleration Probe

manufactured using the shapelets formalism, enable us to quantitatively predict
the future sensitivity to weak lensing shear. The high number density of
galaxies resolved from space will enable maps of dark matter to be produced in
two and three dimensions, with a resolution superior to that from the ground.
Such observations will also afford reduced systematics for high-precision
measurements of weak lensing statistics. These will be used to set tight
constraints on cosmological parameters. In particular, the parameter for
equation of state of dark energy, w, will be measured using weak lensing with a
precision comparable to and somewhat orthogonal to constraints from other

and we argue that they formed out of gas inflow driven by the bar. As suggested
by N-body models, h3 appears to be a reliable tracer of asymmetries in disks,
allowing to discriminate between axisymmetric and barred disks seen in
projection. B/PS bulges (and thus a large fraction of all bulges) appear to be
made-up mostly of disk material which has acquired a large vertical extent
through bar-driven vertical instabilities. Their formation is thus probably
dominated by secular evolution processes rather than merging. [Abridged]

respect to the star formation aspect. Following this scenario, the massive
stars of a first stellar generation chemically enrich the globular progenitor
cloud up to Galactic halo metallicities and sweep it into an expanding
spherical shell of gas. This paper investigates the ability of this swept
proto-globular cloud to become gravitationally unstable and, therefore, to seed
the formation of second generation stars which may later on form a globular
cluster. We use a simple model based on a linear perturbation theory for
transverse motions in a shell of gas to demonstrate that the pressures by which
the progenitor clouds are bound and the supernova numbers required to achieve
Galactic halo metallicities support the successful development of the shell
transverse collapse. Interestingly, the two parameters controling the
metallicity achieved through self-enrichment, namely the number of supernovae
and the external pressure, also rule the surface density of the shell and thus
its ability to undergo a transverse collapse. Such a supernova-induced origin
for the globular cluster stars opens therefore the way to the understanding of
the halo metallicity distributions. This model is also able to explain the
lower limit of the halo globular cluster metallicity.

The study is based on the analysis of 38 Damped Ly alpha systems (DLAs) for

representative of metal-poor galaxies in the redshift range 0.6 </= z </= 3.4
selected on the basis of their absorption HI column density (N(HI) >/= 2 x
10^{20} atoms cm^{-2}). We find that the dust fraction increases with
metallicity, from f_{Fe}~0 at [Fe/H] ~ -2 dex, up to f_{Fe} ~ 0.9 at solar
metallicity; the increase is fast below [Fe/H] ~ -1 dex and mild at higher
metallicities. We also find some evidence for an increase of f_{Fe} with cosmic
time; a large fraction of the systems younger than ~3 Gyr has f_{Fe} </~ 0.5.
These results indicate the dust-to-metal ratio increases in the course of
chemical evolution, at variance with the hypothesis of an approximately
constant dust-to-metal ratio, commonly adopted in models of galactic evolution.
This hypothesis is consistent with local and high-redshift data only when the
metallicity is relatively high ([Fe/H] >/~ -1 dex). The results of this work
suggest that the main mechanisms of dust formation may be rather sensitive to
the level of metallicity attained by a galaxy in the course of its chemical
evolution. A metallicity-dependent dust production by SNe II seems to be the
most promising mechanism for explaining the rise of f_{Fe} at [Fe/H] </~ -1

continuum luminosity is often adopted to estimate the BLR size and then the

indicator of photoionizing luminosity for extremely radio-loud AGNs because the
jets usually contribute significantly to the optical continuum. Therefore, the
black hole masses derived for blazar-type AGNs with this method are probably
overestimated. Here we first derived a tight empirical relation between the BLR
size and the H$_\beta$ emission line luminosity, $R(\rm{light-days})=
24.05(L_{H_\beta}/10^{42} ergs s^{-1})^{0.68}$, from a sample of 34 AGNs with
the BLR size estimated with the reverberation mapping technique. Then we
applied this relation to estimate the black hole masses of some AGNs and found
that for many extremely radio-loud AGNs the black hole masses obtained with the
$R-L_{H_\beta}$ relation are systematically lower than those derived previously
with the $R-L_{5100\AA}$ relation, while for radio-quiet and slightly
radio-loud AGNs the results obtained with these two methods are almost the
same. The difference of black hole masses estimated with these two relations
increases with the radio-loudness for extremely radio-loud AGNs, which is
consistent with the fact that their equivalent widths of H$_{\beta}$ emission
line become smaller at higher radio-loudness. If the small H$_{\beta}$
equivalent widths of extremely radio-loud AGNs are indeed caused by the beaming
effect, we argue that the optical emission line luminosity may be a better
tracer of ionizing luminosity for blazar-type AGNs and the black hole mass
derived with the $R-L_{H_\beta}$ relation are probably more accurate.

of the cavity. To this end we investigate the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model
in the strong coupling regime at high temperatures. The dynamics is
investigated within the Bloch-Redfield formalism. At low temperatures, when
only the few lowest levels are occupied the susceptibility can be presented as
a sum of contributions from independent level-to-level transitions. This
corresponds to the secular (random phase) approximation in the Bloch-Redfield
formalism. At temperatures comparable to and higher than the oscillator
frequency, many transitions become important and a multiple-peak structure
appears. We show that in this regime the secular approximation breaks down, as
soon as the peaks start to overlap. In other words, the susceptibility is no
longer a sum of contributions from independent transitions. We treat the
dynamics of the system numerically by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian

in diffuse powder scattering, a serendipitous match between the in-plane
lattice constant of NCCO and the lattice constant of one of the decomposition
products, (Nd,Ce)2O3, causes the secondary phase to form an oriented,
quasi-two-dimensional epitaxial structure. Consequently, diffraction peaks from
the secondary phase appear at rational positions (H,K,0) in the reciprocal
space of NCCO. Additionally, because of neodymium paramagnetism, the
application of a magnetic field increases the low-temperature intensity
observed at these positions via neutron scattering. Such effects may mimic the
formation of a structural superlattice or the strengthening of
antiferromagnetic order of NCCO, but the intrinsic mechanism may be identified
through careful and systematic experimentation. For typical reduction
conditions, the (Nd,Ce)2O3 volume fraction is ~1%, and the secondary-phase
layers exhibit long-range order parallel to the NCCO CuO2 sheets and are 50-100

lattice placed in a {\em non-uniform} external field, shows a commensurate
-incommensurate transition driven by the velocity of the interface. The
non-uniform field has a profile with a fixed shape which is designed to
stabilize a flat interface, and is translated with velocity $v_{e}$. For small
velocities the interface is stuck to the profile and is rippled with a
periodicity which may be either commensurate or incommensurate with the lattice
parameter of the square lattice. For a general orientation of the profile, the
local slope of the interface locks in to one of infinitely many rational
directions producing a devil's staircase structure. These ``lock-in'' or
commensurate structures dissappear as $v_e$ increases through a kinetics driven
commensurate - incommensurate transition. For large $v_e$ the interface becomes
detached from the field profile and coarsens with Kardar-Parisi-Zang exponents.
The complete phase-diagram and the multifractal spectrum corresponding to these
structures have been obtained numerically together with several analytic
results concerning the dynamics of the rippled phases. Our work has
technological implications in crystal growth and the production of surfaces

optical modes, is widely believed to be limited because of diffraction to a
value on the order of a half-wavelength $\lambda /2$ of the light used.
Although immersion microscopes have slightly improved resolution on the order
of $\lambda /2n$, the increased resolution is limited by the small range of
refractive indices n of available transparent materials. Here we demonstrate a
new far-field optical microscope design, which is capable of reaching
nanometer-scale resolution. This microscope uses the fact that the effective
refractive index $n_{eff}$ of a planar dielectric lens or mirror placed on a
metal surface may reach extremely large values, up to $10^3$, as seen by
propagating surface optical modes (plasmons). In our design a magnified planar
image produced originally by surface plasmons in the metal plane is viewed by a
regular microscope. Thus, the theoretical diffraction limit on resolution is
pushed down to nanometer-scale $\lambda /2n_{eff}$ values. Used in reverse,
such a microscope may become an optical lithography tool with nanometer-scale
spatial resolution.

scales Delta and delta_s, where Delta is the mass difference between the

delta_s is the mass difference due to light flavour SU(3) breaking. The primary
conclusion of this work is that finite volume effects arising from the
propagation of Goldstone particles in the effective theory can be altered by
the presence of these scales. Since Delta varies significantly with the heavy
quark mass, these volume effects can be amplified in both heavy and light quark
mass extrapolations (interpolations). As an explicit example, we present
results for B parameters of neutral B meson mixing matrix elements and
heavy-light decay constants to one-loop order in finite volume heavy meson
chiral perturbation theory for full, quenched, and N_f=2+1 partially quenched

significant in quenched and not negligible in partially quenched QCD, although

distribution of the gluons which make up the condensate in the initial

survive after the quantum evolution. We demonstrate that the rapid suppression
of the ratio R_{pA} in the early stages of the evolution is due to the
DGLAP-like evolution of the proton, whose gluon distribution grows much faster
than that in the nucleus because of the large separation between the respective
saturation momenta. The flattening of the Cronin peak, on the other hand, is
due to the evolution of the nucleus. We show that the running coupling effects
slow down the evolution, but eventually lead to a stronger suppression in
R_{pA} at sufficiently large energies.

demonstrate that although the Weinberg sum rules are satisfied in any such

Further, we show that such a model satisfies a set of generalized sum rules.
These sum rules can be understood by looking at the operator product expansion
for the correlation function of chiral currents, and correspond to the absence
of low-dimension gauge-invariant chiral symmetry breaking condensates. These
results imply that, regardless of the couplings and F-constants chosen, the
open moose is not the dual of any QCD-like theory of chiral symmetry breaking.
We also show that the generalized sum rules can be ""solved"", leading to a
compact expression for the difference of vector- and axial-current correlation
functions. This expression allows for a simple formula for the S parameter
(L_10), which implies that S is always positive and of order one in any

constructive proof of the uniqueness theorem for $p$-branes with the

partition function on the disk with Neumann boundary conditions on the
Liouville field (FZZ brane). In the matrix model formulation the curve is
associated with the profile of the Fermi sea of free fermions. These two curves
are not the same. The latter can be seen as a certain reduction of the former.
In particular, it describes only (m,1) ZZ branes, whereas the curve coming from
the FZZ partition function encompasses all (m,n) branes. In fact, one can
construct a set of reductions, one for each fixed n. But only the first one has
a physical interpretation in the corresponding matrix model. Since in the
linear dilaton background the singularities associated with the ZZ branes
degenerate, we study the c=1 matrix model perturbed by a tachyon potential

a prediction how D-branes flow with the perturbation and derive the two-point
bulk correlation function on the disk with the FZZ boundary conditions.

DNA from viral capsids and the force resisting its entry into a colloidal

the energy stored in the capsid as a consequence of the viral genome
(double-stranded DNA) being strongly bent and crowded on itself. The resisting
force is associated with the osmotic pressure exerted by the colloidal
particles in the host solution. Indeed, recent experimental work has
demonstrated that the extent of ejection can be progressively limited by
increasing the external osmotic pressure; at a sufficiently high pressure the
ejection is completely suppressed. We outline here a theoritical analysis that
allows a determination of the internal (capsid) pressure by examining the
different relations between force and pressure inside and outside the capsid,
using the experimentally measured position of the force balance.

formerly found skeletal structures (SS) only by the fact that OSS, in their
interior, are filled in with closely packed blocks of a smaller size, up to
thin capillaries of tens of micron in size. According to suggested hypothesis,
the structure-forming dust is produced due to volcanic activity and atmospheric
electricity. Such SS may fall on the ocean surface and produce an OSS. This
idea is supported by the adsorption of air bubbles in the water by the SS to
give a partial flotation of SS. In the sea water, various substances in
different phase states of matter are in touch. This suggests the hypothesis,
for the possibility of the action of surface tension even on the blocks of SS
which is immersed in the sea. This phenomenon results in the aggregation of
blocks deposited from the atmosphere on the ocean's surface, to form eventually
an OSS. The skeletal structuring assumes that the individual straight and
rather strong blocks may be joined flexibly, similarly to joints in a skeleton.

the fine structure of VFC suggests the OSS to be a carrier/source of major
electrodynamical properties of initial phase of every WS. This implies that the
main body of WS may be interpreted as a special type of atmospheric aerosol
dusty plasma. In such a framework, the WS is considered as the long-lived
filament, being formed in electric discharge in the presence of electric and
magnetic fields in the course of electric breakdown between the cloud and ocean
surface. In this case the charged water aerosol (formed by means of VFC's
capillaries in the presence of very powerful electric field) may be an analog
of a microdust which is lifting upward to the cloud due to effects of
electrostatic forces. With such a capillary-electrostatic model of WS, it
appears possible to interpret many effects related to WS. We suggest a
hypothesis for dynamics of WS and a possible scenario of its transition to
classical tornado.

tune the Zeeman energies of the individual (pseudo-)spins. It is important to
generalize this scheme to higher dimensional networks, since a real device
would probably be of that kind. Such generalisations have been proposed, but
only at the severe cost that the efficiency of qubit storage must *fall*. Here
we propose the use of multi-qubit gates within such higher-dimensional arrays,
finding a novel three-qubit gate that can in fact increase the efficiency

networks that can constitute a better embodiment of the 'always on' concept - a

computer during it's operation it is necessary to make the computation act in a
logically reversible manner\cite{Lan61}. Such logically reversible operations
require a number of auxiliary bits to be stored, maintaining a history of the
computation, and which allows the initial state to be reconstructed by running
the computation in reverse. These auxiliary bits are wasteful of resources and
may require a dissipation of energy for them to be reused. A simple procedure
due to Bennett\cite{Ben73} allows these auxiliary bits to be ""tidied"", without
dissipating energy, on a classical computer. All reversible classical
computations can be made tidy in this way. However, this procedure depends upon
a classical operation (""cloning"") that cannot be generalised to quantum
computers\cite{WZ82}. Quantum computations must be logically reversible, and
therefore produce auxiliary qbits during their operation. We show that there
are classes of quantum computation for which Bennett's procedure cannot be
implemented. For some of these computations there may exist another method for
which the computation may be ""tidied"". However, we also show there are quantum
computations for which there is no possible method for tidying the auxiliary
qbits. Not all reversible quantum computations can be made ""tidy"". This
represents a fundamental additional energy burden to quantum computations. This
paper extends results in \cite{Mar01}.

  through double quantum dots","30 pages, 14 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066201",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider single-channel transmission through a double quantum dot system
consisting of two single dots that are connected by a wire and coupled each to
one lead. The system is described in the framework of the S-matrix theory by
using the effective Hamiltonian of the open quantum system. It consists of the
Hamiltonian of the closed system (without attached leads) and a term that
accounts for the coupling of the states via the continuum of propagating modes
in the leads. This model allows to study the physical meaning of branch points
in the complex plane. They are points of coalesced eigenvalues and separate the
two scenarios with avoided level crossings and without any crossings in the
complex plane. They influence strongly the features of transmission through
double quantum dots.

and propose an operational method to detect them. The quantum dwell time is
pointed out to be a conserved quantity, totally bypassing Pauli's theorem.
Furthermore, the quantum dwell time in a region for one dimensional motion is
doubly degenerate. In presence of a potential barrier, the dwell time becomes
bounded, unlike the classical quantity. By using off-resonance coupling to a
laser we propose an operational method to measure the absorption by a complex
potential, and thereby the average time spent by an incoming atom in the laser
region.
