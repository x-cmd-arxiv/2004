spherical degree (l) aligned to the magnetic axis of a spinning neutron star
reproduce the morphological features of pulsar beams. In our model, rotation of
the pulsar carries a pattern of pulsation nodes underneath our sightline,
reproducing the longitude stationary structure seen in average pulse profiles,
while the associated time-like oscillations reproduce ""drifting
subpulses""--features that change their longitude between successive pulsar
spins. We will show that the presence of nodal lines can account for observed
180 degree phase jumps in drifting subpulses and their otherwise poor phase
stability, even if the time-like oscillations are strictly periodic. Our model
can also account for the ""mode changes"" and ""nulls"" observed in some pulsars as
quasiperiodic changes between pulsation modes of different l or radial overtone
n, analogous to pulsation mode changes observed in oscillating white dwarf
stars. We will discuss other definitive and testable requirements of our model
and show that they are qualitatively supported by existing data. While
reserving judgment until the completion of quantitative tests, we are inspired
enough by the existing observational support for our model to speculate about
the excitation mechanism of the non-radial pulsations, the physics we can learn
from them, and their relationship to the period evolution of pulsars.

accretion ratio, which we define as the ratio of the mass accretion rate onto
the companion to the mass loss rate from the mass-losing primary star. We
characterize the flow by the mean normal velocity of wind on the critical Roche
surface of the mass-losing star, Vr. When Vr<0.4 A Omega, where A and Omega are
the separation between the two stars and the angular orbital frequency of the

ensure the surfaces of two components lying on an equipotential surface by
interpolation using this radius grid when we follow the evolution of the

We find that the region of energy transfer has significant influence on the

transfer may occur in the outermost layers of the common convective envelope

common envelope for A-type systems. Meanwhile, if we assume that the energy
transfer takes place in the outermost layers for our model with low total mass,

contracts rapidly, suggesting that W-subtype systems may be caused by expansion

many characteristic features of spin glass dynamics below a freezing
temperature $T_g$, much smaller than their Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta$.
The ageing properties of their thermoremanent magnetization can be well
accounted for by the same scaling law as in spin glasses, and the values of the
scaling exponents are very close. The effects of temperature variations during
ageing have been specifically investigated. In the pyrochlore and the
bi-Kagom\'e compounds, a decrease of temperature after some waiting period at a
certain temperature $T_p$ re-initializes ageing and the evolution at the new
temperature is the same as if the system were just quenched from above $T_g$.
However, as the temperature is raised back to $T_p$, the sample recovers the
state it had previously reached at that temperature. These features are known
in spin glasses as rejuvenation and memory effects. They are clear signatures
of the spin glass dynamics. In the Kagom\'e compound, there is also some
rejuvenation and memory, but much larger temperature changes are needed to
observe the effects. In that sense, the behaviour of this compound is
quantitatively different from that of spin glasses.

is limited to 0.5 when the Feshbach resonance sweep rate is sufficiently slow
to pass adiabatically through the Landau Zener transition but faster than ``the
collision rate'' in the gas, and increases beyond 0.5 when it is slower. The
0.5 efficiency limit is due to the preparation of a statistical mixture of two
spin-states, required to enable s-wave scattering. By constructing the
many-body state of the system we show that this preparation yields a mixture of
even and odd parity pair-states, where only even parity can produce molecules.
The odd parity spin-symmetric states must decorrelate before the constituent
atoms can further Feshbach scatter thereby increasing the conversion
efficiency; ``the collision rate'' is the pair decorrelation rate.

in a set of ``preferred frame'' models, I demonstrate that this question is
ill-posed: the distinction can only be made in the context of a class of

of theories one chooses. It remains true, however, that for a large class of

are thus not yet accurate enough to measure the speed of gravity.

differential operator which $lowers$ the degree of divergence in integration on
the RHS, by $TWO$ units. This warrants $\Sigma(p-k)\approx \Sigma(p)$ in the
integrand since its $k$-dependence is no longer sensitive to the principal term
$(p-k)^2$ in the quark propagator. The simplified DSE (which incorporates WT
identity in the Landau gauge) is satisfied for large $p^2$ by $\Sigma(p)$ =
$\Sigma(0)/(1 + \beta p^2)$, except for Log factors. The limit $p^2 =0$
determines $\Sigma_0$.A third limit $p^2 = -m_0^2$ defines the $dynamical$ mass

present a complete quasiclassical treatment of the BPS sector of this model,
including the full set of the first-order equations, derivations of all
relevant zero modes, and derivation of an effective low-energy theory for the
corresponding collective coordinates. The macroscopic description is provided
by a CP(1) model with or without twisted mass. The confined monopoles -- string
junctions of the microscopic theory -- are mapped onto BPS kinks of the CP(1)
model. The string junction is 1/4 BPS. Masses and other characteristics of the
confined monopoles are matched with those of the CP(1)-model kinks. The
matching demonstrates the occurrence of an anomaly in the monopole central
charge in 4D Yang-Mills theory. We study what becomes of the confined monopole
in the bona fide non-Abelian limit of degenerate mass terms where a global
SU(2) symmetry is restored. The solution of the macroscopic model is known e.g.
from the mirror description of the CP(1) model. The monopoles, aka CP(1)-model

stability analysis of important classes of nonlinear distributed dynamics, such
as convection-diffusion-reaction processes, Lagrangian and Hamilton-Jacobi
dynamics, and optimal controllers and observers. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
controller and a similar optimal nonlinear observer design are studied.
Explicit stability conditions are given, which extend the well-known conditions
on controllability and observability Grammians for linear time-varying systems.
Stability of the Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics is assessed by evaluating the Hessian
of the system state along system trajectories. In contrast to stability proofs
based on energy dissipation,this principle allows to conclude on stability of
energy-based systems that are excited by time-varying inputs. In this context,
contraction can be regarded as describing new variational conservation laws and
the stability of entropy producing processes.

in case both the original phase space and the reduced phase space are
(symplectomorphic to) cotangent bundles. Under the assumption that the original
cotangent bundle $T^*Q$ carries a symplectique structure of form
$\omega_{B_0}=\omega_0 + \pi^*B_0$ with $B_0$ a closed two-form on $Q$, is
equipped by the cotangent lift of a proper and free Lie group action on $Q$ and
by an invariant star product that admits a $G$-equivariant quantum momentum
map, we show that the reduced phase space inherits from $T^*Q$ a star product.
Moreover, we provide a concrete description of the resulting star product in
terms of the initial star product on $T^*Q$ and prove that our reduction scheme
is independent of the characteristic class of the initial star product. Unlike
other existing reduction schemes we are thus able to reduce not only strongly
invariant star products. Furthermore in this article, we establish a relation
between the characteristic class of the original star product and the
characteristic class of the reduced star product and provide a classification
up to $G$-equivalence of those star products on $(T^*Q,\omega_{B_0})$, which
are invariant with respect to a lifted Lie group action. Finally, we
investigate the question under which circumstances `quantization commutes with
reduction' and show that in our examples non-trivial restrictions arise.

space as a Poisson manifold, and the current paper first surveys this material
adding further mathematical and other detail, including the underlying
geometric work by Penner on classical Teichm\""uller theory. In particular, the
earlier quantum ordering solution is found to essentially agree with an
``improved'' operator ordering given by serially traversing general edge-paths
on a graph in the underlying surface. Now, insofar as Thurston's sphere of
projectivized foliations of compact support provides a useful compactification
for Teichm\""uller space in the classical case, it is natural to consider
corresponding limits of appropriate operators to provide a framework for
studying degenerations of quantum hyperbolic structures. After surveying the
required background material on Thurston theory and ``train tracks'', the
current paper continues to give a quantization of Thurston's boundary in the
special case of the once-punctured torus, where there are already substantial
analytical and combinatorial challenges. Indeed, an operatorial version of
continued fractions as well as the improved quantum ordering are required to
prove existence of these limits. Since Thurston's boundary for the
once-punctured torus is a topological circle, the main new result may be
regarded as a quantization of this circle. There is a discussion of quantizing
Thurston's boundary spheres for higher genus surfaces in closing remarks.

application to the demographic data for Switzerland (1876-2002). Particularly,
the Weon model simply defines the maximum longevity, which is induced in nature
by the mortality dynamics. In this study, we reconsider the definition of the
maximum longevity and the effectiveness for longevity by the combined effect of
the survival and mortality functions. The results suggest that the mortality
function should be zero at the maximum longevity, since the density function is
zero but the survival function is not zero. Furthermore, the effectiveness for
longevity can be maximized at the characteristic life by the complementarity
between the survival and mortality functions, which suggests that there may be
two parts of rectangularization for longevity. The historical trends for
Switzerland (1876-2002) implies that there may be a fundamental limiting force
to restrict the increase of the effectiveness. As a result, it seems that the
density function is essential to define and understand the mortality dynamics,
the maximum longevity, the effectiveness for longevity, the paradigm of
rectangularization and the historical trends of the effectiveness by the
complementarity between the survival and mortality functions.

specific mutations that affect cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,
differentiation, and many other cell functions. One hallmark of cancerous
genomes is genomic instability, with mutation rates far greater than those of
normal cells. In microsatellite instability (MIN tumors), these are often
caused by damage to mismatch repair genes, allowing further mutation of the
genome and tumor progression. These mutation rates may lie near the error
catastrophe found in the quasispecies model of adaptive RNA genomes, suggesting
that further increasing mutation rates will destroy cancerous genomes. However,
recent results have demonstrated that DNA genomes exhibit an error threshold at
mutation rates far lower than their conservative counterparts. Furthermore,
while the maximum viable mutation rate in conservative systems increases
indefinitely with increasing master sequence fitness, the semiconservative
threshold plateaus at a relatively low value. This implies a paradox, wherein
inaccessible mutation rates are found in viable tumor cells. In this paper, we
address this paradox, demonstrating an isomorphism between the conservatively
replicating (RNA) quasispecies model and the semiconservative (DNA) model with
post-methylation DNA repair mechanisms impaired. Thus, as DNA repair becomes
inactivated, the maximum viable mutation rate increases smoothly to that of a
conservatively replicating system on a transformed landscape, with an upper
bound that is dependent on replication rates. We postulate that inactivation of
post-methylation repair mechanisms are fundamental to the progression of a
tumor cell and hence these mechanisms act as a method for prevention and
destruction of cancerous genomes.
