nearest star where we directly observe the solid material required for planet
formation. Since 85% of stars are M-type, the AU Mic disk provides new clues on
how the majority of planetary systems might form and evolve.

rotation curves, are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within
these objects. A new method for extracting rotation curves from HI data cubes
is presented; this takes into account the existence of a warp and minimises
projection effects. The rotation curves obtained are tested by taking them as
input to construct model data cubes that are compared to the observed ones: the
agreement is excellent. On the contrary, the model data cubes built using
rotation curves obtained with standard methods, such as the first-moment
analysis, fail the test. The HI rotation curves agree well with the Halpha
data, where they coexist. Moreover, the combined Halpha + HI rotation curves
are smooth, symmetric and extended to large radii.
  The rotation curves are decomposed into stellar, gaseous and dark matter
contributions and the inferred density distribution is compared to various mass
distributions: dark haloes with a central density core, $\Lambda$ Cold Dark
Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) haloes (NFW, Moore profiles), HI scaling and MOND. The
observations point to haloes with constant density cores of size $r_{core} \sim
r_{opt}$ and central densities scaling approximately as $\rho_0 \propto
r_{core}^{-2/3}$. $\Lambda$CDM models (which predict a central cusp in the
density profile) are in clear conflict with the data. HI scaling and MOND
cannot account for the observed kinematics: we find some counter-examples.

magnitude difference between primary and companion candidate, the latter could
well be substellar (Neuh""auser et al. 2003) with the spectral type being
roughly M7-L9 from the JHK colors (Chauvin et al. 2003). With the H- and K-band
spectra now obtained with ISAAC at the VLT, the spectral type of the companion
candidate is found to be M6-9.5. Assuming the same age and distance as for the
primary star (~35 Myrs, 50 to 85 pc), this yields a mass of ~25 Jupiter masses
for the companion, hence indeed substellar. After TWA-5 B and HR 7329 B, this
is the third brown dwarf companion around a nearby (up to 100 pc) young (up to
100 Myrs) star. A total of three confirmed brown dwarf companions (any mass,
separation above 50 AU) around 79 stars surveyed in three young nearby
associations corresponds to a frequency of 6 \pm 4 % (with a correction for
missing companions which are almost on the same line-of-sight as the primary
star instead of being separated well), consistent with the expectation, if
binaries have the same mass function as field stars. Hence, it seems that there
is no brown dwarf desert at wide separations.

Low
Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) are much dimmer galactic centers, and
are often believed to be quasars that ran out of gaseous fuel. LLAGN accretion
disks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-stars
left from the previous stronger accretion activity. In principle, these stars
may produce several important effects: (i) contribute to the optical/UV spectra
of some LLAGN; (ii) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty disks
could dominate the LLAGN infra-red spectra; (iii) deplete the (accretion) gas
disk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole (SMBH);
(iv) stars, individually or in groups, may slow down and modulate the accretion
flow significantly due to their inertia. In this way they may produce the LLAGN
cut-off disks; (v) alternatively, frequent enough stellar collisions and
resulting stellar disruptions could keep the inner disk empty. Here we explore
these ideas. We find that, despite ``low'' luminosities of LLAGN,
unrealistically high stellar densities are required to make a sizable radiative
contribution to the (HST) optical/UV spectra of these galactic nuclei. Stellar
contribution to the infrared spectrum is more likely. Further, if LLAGN are in
a quasi steady-state for as long as 10^7 years or more, too high stellar
densities would again be required to significantly affect the dynamics of
accretion flow. However, if LLAGN are ``short''-lived phenomena, e.g. t < 10^5
years, quiescent states of quiescence-outburst cycles, then embedded stars may
be much more important through the mass effects (iii) -- (v). With observations
of LLAGN becoming progressively better, it will be more and more difficult to
neglect the presence of close stars in and around nuclear accretion disks.

Cluster (ONC) to study the X-ray properties of a large sample of
pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars with optically determined rotation periods. Our
goal is to elucidate the origins of X-rays in PMS stars by seeking out
connections between the X-rays and the mechanisms most likely driving their
production--rotation and accretion. In our sample X-ray luminosity is
significantly correlated with stellar rotation, in the sense of decreasing
Lx/Lbol with more rapid rotation, suggesting that these stars are in the
""super-saturated"" regime of the rotation-activity relationship. However, we
also find that stars with optical rotation periods are significantly biased to
high Lx. This is not the result of magnitude bias in the optical
rotation-period sample but rather to the diminishingly small amplitude of
optical variations in stars with low Lx. Evidently, there exists in the ONC a
population of stars whose rotation periods are unknown and that possess lower
average X-ray luminosities than those of stars with known rotation periods.
These stars may sample the linear regime of the rotation-activity relationship.
Accretion also manifests itself in X-rays, though in a somewhat
counterintuitive fashion: While stars with spectroscopic signatures of
accretion show harder X-ray spectra than non-accretors, they show lower X-ray
luminosities and no enhancement of X-ray variability. We interpret these
findings in terms of a common origin for the X-ray emission observed from both
accreting and non-accreting stars, with the X-rays from accreting stars simply
being attenuated by magnetospheric accretion columns. This suggests that X-rays
from PMS stars have their origins primarily in chromospheres, not accretion.

existence of such a correlation is evidence against both accretion and major
merger scenarios as an explanation of the entire metal-poor GC systems of
luminous galaxies. However, our relation arises naturally in an in situ picture
of GC formation, and is consistent with the truncation of metal-poor GC
formation by reionization. A further implication is that the ages of metal-poor
GCs in dwarf galaxies constrain the main epoch of galaxy formation in
hierarchical models. If the ages of old metal-poor GCs in Local Group dwarfs (>

not (For the highly magnetized fireball, the magnetic field is ordered, the
high linear polarization of the multi-wavelength emission is expected). We find

the theory of quantum phase transitions; namely, the coupling of the
order-parameter fluctuations to other soft modes, and the resulting
impossibility of constructing a simple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory in terms
of the order parameter only. The soft modes in question are manifestations of
generic scale invariance, i.e., the appearance of long-range order in whole
regions in the phase diagram. The concept of generic scale invariance, and its
influence on critical behavior, is explained using various examples, both
classical and quantum mechanical. The peculiarities of quantum phase
transitions are discussed, with emphasis on the fact that they are more
susceptible to the effects of generic scale invariance than their classical
counterparts. Explicit examples include: the quantum ferromagnetic transition
in metals, with or without quenched disorder; the metal-superconductor
transition at zero temperature; and the quantum antiferromagnetic transition.
Analogies with classical phase transitions in liquid crystals and classical
fluids are pointed out, and a unifying conceptual framework is developed for
all transitions that are influenced by generic scale invariance.

that consists of two single dots coupled by a wire of finite length L. In order
to explain the numerically obtained results for a realistic double dot system
we explore a simple model. It consists, as the realistic system, of two dots
connected by a wire of length L. However, each of the two single dots is
characterized by a few energy levels only, and the wire is assumed to have only
one level whose energy depends on L. The transmission is described by using
S-matrix theory. The model explains in particular the splitting of the resonant
transmission peaks and the origin of the transmission zeros. The latter are
independent of the length of the wire. When the transmission zeros of the
single dots are of first order and both single dots are identical, those of the
double dot are of second order. First-order transmission zeros cause phase
jumps of the transmission amplitude by $\pi$, while there are no phase jumps
related to second-order transmission zeros. In this latter case, a phase jump
appears due to a resonance state whose decay width vanishes when crossing the
energy of the transmission zero.

  This paper investigates the effect of microreboots on end-users of an

effective as full reboots, but are significantly less disruptive in terms of
downtime and lost work. In our experiments, microreboots reduced the number of

end-user-visible latency during recovery. Due to their low cost, microreboots
can be used aggressively, even when their necessity is less than certain, hence
adding to the reduced recovery time a reduction in the fault detection time,
which further improves availability.

investigate the gravitational collapse by carefully studying not only the
dynamics of the matter, but also that of the trapped surfaces, i.e. of both the
apparent and event horizons formed during the collapse. The use of these
surfaces, together with the dynamical horizon framework, allows for a precise
measurement of the black-hole mass and spin. The ability to successfully
perform these simulations for sufficiently long times relies on excising a
region of the computational domain which includes the singularity and is within
the apparent horizon. The dynamics of the collapsing matter is strongly
influenced by the initial amount of angular momentum in the progenitor star
and, for initial models with sufficiently high angular velocities, the collapse
can lead to the formation of an unstable disc in differential rotation. All the
simulations performed with uniformly rotating initial data and a polytropic or
ideal-fluid equation of state show no evidence of shocks or of the presence of
matter on stable orbits outside the black hole.

deformation and with low angular momentum were produced in peripheral heavy-ion
collisions. Under the conditions of small shape distortions and low angular
momentum, the theoretical description of the fission process can be
considerably simplified, and the relevant information on dissipation can be
better extracted than in conventional experiments based on fusion-fission
reactions. In addition, this experimental approach induces very high excitation
energies, a condition necessary to observe transient effects. The experimental
data were taken at GSI using a set-up especially conceived for fission studies
in inverse kinematics. This set-up allowed determining three observables whose
sensitivity to dissipation was investigated for the first time: the total
fission cross sections of 238U at 1 A GeV as a function of the target mass,
and, for the reaction of 238U at 1 A GeV on a (CH2)n target, the partial
fission cross sections and the partial charge distributions of the fission

adapted to the conditions of the reactions investigated leads to clear
conclusions on the strength of dissipation at small deformation where the

magnetic susceptibility have been measured over a wide range of temperatures

magnetic field. The bulk superconductivity parameters such as the critical
temperature Tc = 9.26 K and the upper critical field Bc2(0) = 410 mT are found
to be in good agreement with previous data. Evidence for surface
superconductivity at fields above Bc2 is found in all samples. The critical
surface field exceeds the Ginzburg-Landau field Bc3 = 1.695Bc2 by about 10% in
BCP-treated samples and increases even further if EP or LTB are applied. From
the field dependence of the susceptibility and a power-law analysis of the
complex ac conductivity and resistivity the existence of two different phases
of surface superconductivity can be established which resemble the Meissner and
Abrikosov phases in the bulk: (1) coherent surface superconductivity, allowing
sc shielding currents flowing around the entire cylindrical sample, for
external fields B in the range between Bc2 and Bcohc3, and (2) incoherent
surface superconductivity with disconnected sc domains between Bcohc3 and Bc3.
The coherent critical surface field separating the two phases is found to be
Bcoh c3 = 0.81Bc3 for all samples. The exponents in the power law analysis are
different for BCP and EP samples, pointing to different surface topologies.

slip of fluid in the lid driven cavity flow where the no-slip boundary
condition causes unphysical stress divergence. The MD results not only show the
existence of fluid slip but also verify the validity of the Navier slip
boundary condition. To better understand the fluid slip in this problem, a
continuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated based upon the MD verification
of the Navier boundary condition and the Newtonian stress. Our model has no
adjustable parameter because all the material parameters (density, viscosity,
and slip length) are directly determined from MD simulations. Steady-state
velocity fields from continuum calculations are in quantitative agreement with
those from MD simulations, from the molecular-scale structure to the global
flow. The main discovery is as follows. In the immediate vicinity of the
corners where moving and fixed solid surfaces intersect, there is a core
partial-slip region where the slippage is large at the moving solid surface and
decays away from the intersection quickly. In particular, the structure of this
core region is nearly independent of the system size. On the other hand, for
sufficiently large system, an additional partial-slip region appears where the
slippage varies as $1/r$ with $r$ denoting the distance from the corner along
the moving solid surface. The existence of this wide power-law region is in
accordance with the asymptotic $1/r$ variation of stress and the Navier
