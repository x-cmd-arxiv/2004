the low mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer on May 2,
  1997. We investigate closely the flux profile during the burst expansion
stage. Applying a semi-analytical model we are able to uncover the behavior of
a photospheric radius and to simulate the evolution of neutron star
(NS)-accretion disk system. The bottom flux L_{bot} is a few times the
Eddington limit L_{Edd} for outer layers, because the electron cross-section is
a few times less than the Thomson cross-section at such a high temperatures.
The surplus of energy flux with respect to the Eddington, $L_{bot}-L_{Edd}$,
goes into the potential energy of the expanded envelope. As cooling of the
burning zone starts the surplus decreases and thus the envelope shrinks while
the emergent photon flux stays the same $L=L_{Edd}$. At a certain moment the NS
low-hemisphere, previously screened by the disk, becomes visible to the
observer. Consequently, the flux detected by the observer increases. Indeed, we
observe to the paradoxical situation when the burning zone cools, but the
apparent flux increases because of the NS-accretion disk geometry. We
demonstrate a strong observational evidence of NS-accretion disk occultation in
the behavior of the observed bolometric flux. We estimate the anisotropy due to
geometry and find that the system should have a high inclination angle.
Finally, we apply an analytical model of X-ray spectral formation in the
neutron star atmosphere during burst decay stage to infer the neutron star (NS)
mass-radius relation.

starburst nucleus of NGC 7714, supplemented by the very-low-metallicity galaxy
I Zw 18. In each case, we see strong Milky Way absorption systems from H2, but
intrinsic absorption within each galaxy is weak or undetectable, perhaps
because of the ""UV bias"" in which reddened stars which lie behind
molecular-rich areas are also heavily reddened. We see striking changes in the
stellar-wind lines from these populations with metallicity, suggesting that C
II, C III, C IV, N II, N III, and P V lines are potential tracers of stellar
metallicity in star-forming galaxies. Three of these relations - involving N

The major difference in continuum shapes among these systems is that the giant

solutions to survey field placement are generally extremely difficult to find,
especially in this era of large-scale galaxy surveys, as the space of available
solutions is vast (2N dimensional) and false optimal solutions abound. The
6dFGS algorithm utilises the Metropolis (simulated annealing) method to
overcome this problem. By design the algorithm gives uniform completeness
independent of local density, so as to result in a highly complete and uniform
observed sample. The adaptive tiling achieves a sampling rate of approximately
95%, a variation in the sampling uniformity of less than 5%, and an efficiency
in terms of used fibres per field of greater than 90%. We have tested whether
the tiling algorithm systematically biases the large-scale structure in the
survey by studying the two-point correlation function of mock 6dF volumes. Our
analysis shows that the constraints on fibre proximity with 6dF lead to
under-estimating galaxy clustering on small scales (< 1 Mpc) by up to ~20%, but
that the tiling introduces no significant sampling bias at larger scales.

inspiralling compact binaries. The second part provides a brief review of high
frequency gravitational waves. In the frequency range above (say) 100Hz,
gravitational collapse, rotational instabilities and oscillations of the
remnant compact objects are potentially important sources of gravitational
waves. Significant and unique information concerning the various stages of
collapse, the evolution of protoneutron stars and the details of the
supranuclear equation of state of such objects can be drawn from careful study
of the gravitational-wave signal. As the amount of exciting physics one may be
able to study via the detections of gravitational waves from these sources is
truly inspiring, there is strong motivation for the development of future
generations of ground based detectors sensitive in the range from hundreds of
Hz to several kHz.

analysis to search for inspiraling compact binaries. The length of data used
for the coincidence analysis is 275 hours when both TAMA300 and LISM detectors
are operated simultaneously. TAMA300 and LISM data are analyzed by matched
filtering, and candidates for gravitational wave events are obtained. If there
is a true gravitational wave signal, it should appear in both data of detectors
with consistent waveforms characterized by masses of stars, amplitude of the
signal, the coalescence time and so on. We introduce a set of coincidence
conditions of the parameters, and search for coincident events. This procedure
reduces the number of fake events considerably, by a factor $\sim 10^{-4}$
compared with the number of fake events in single detector analysis. We find
that the number of events after imposing the coincidence conditions is
consistent with the number of accidental coincidences produced purely by noise.
We thus find no evidence of gravitational wave signals. We obtain an upper
limit of 0.046 /hours (CL $= 90 %$) to the Galactic event rate within 1kpc from
the Earth. The method used in this paper can be applied straightforwardly to
the case of coincidence observations with more than two detectors with
arbitrary arm directions.

Type IIB string theory in the presence of D3 and anti-D3-branes. The inflaton
is the position of a D3-brane in the internal space. By suitably adjusting
fluxes and the location of symmetrically placed anti-D3-branes, we show that at
a point of enhanced symmetry, the inflaton potential V can have a broad
maximum, satisfying the condition V''/V << 1 in Planck units. On starting close
to the top of this potential the slow-roll conditions can be met. Observational
constraints impose significant restrictions. As a first pass we show that these
can be satisfied and determine the important scales in the compactification to
within an order of magnitude. One robust feature is that the scale of inflation
is low, H = O(10^{10}) GeV. Removing the observational constraints makes it
much easier to construct a slow-roll inflationary model. Generalizations and
consequences including the possibility of eternal inflation are also discussed.
A more careful study, including explicit constructions of the model in string
theory, is left for the future.
