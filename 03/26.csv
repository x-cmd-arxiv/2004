This suggests that the low redshift contamination of this i'-drop sample is
smaller than that observed at brighter magnitudes where values of 10-40% have
been reported. The J-H colours are consistent with a slope flat in f_nu (f_lam
\propto lam^{-2}), as would be expected for an unreddened starburst. There is,
however, evidence for a marginally bluer spectral slope (f_lam propto
lam^{-2.2) which is perhaps indicative of an extremely young starburst (~10 Myr
old) or a top heavy initial mass function and little dust. The low levels of
contamination, median photometric redshift of z~6.0 and blue spectral slope,
inferred using the near-infrared data, supports the validity of the assumptions
in our earlier work in estimating the star formation rates and, that the
majority of the i-drop candidates galaxies lie at z~6.

the role played by supernovae of different types (II, Ia) allowing us to follow

formation histories of the galaxies as inferred by the observed color-magnitude

characterized by very low star formation efficiencies ($\nu = 0.005 - 0.5 Gyr
^{-1}$) with only Sagittarius having a higher one ($\nu = 1.0 - 5.0 Gyr

6 - 15; iii) a high wind efficiency is required in order to reproduce the
abundance ratios and the present day gas mass of the galaxies; iv) the
predicted age-metallicity relation implies that the stars of the dSphs reach
solar metallicities in a time-scale of the order of 2 - 6 Gyr; v) the
metallicity distributions of stars in dSphs exhibit a peak around [Fe/H] $\sim$
-1.8 to -1.5 dex, with the exception of Sagittarius ([Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.8 dex);

9 and LSS 1274, using spectra taken by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer (FUSE). Column densities are measured for many atomic and molecular
species (H I, D I, C I, N I, O I, P II, Ar I, Fe II, and H2), but our main
focus is on measuring the D/H ratios for these extended lines of sight, as D/H
is an important diagnostic for both cosmology and Galactic chemical evolution.
We find D/H=(1.00+/-0.37)e-5 towards JL 9, and D/H=(0.76+/-0.36)e-5 towards LSS
1274 (2 sigma uncertainties). With distances of 590+/-160 pc and 580+/-100 pc,
respectively, these two lines of sight are currently among the longest Galactic
lines of sight with measured D/H. With the addition of these measurements, we
see a significant tendency for longer Galactic lines of sight to yield low D/H
values, consistent with previous inferences about the deuterium abundance from
D/O and D/N measurements. Short lines of sight with H I column densities of log
N(H I)<19.2 suggest that the gas-phase D/H value within the Local Bubble is
(D/H)_LBg=(1.56+/-0.04)e-5. However, the four longest Galactic lines of sight
with measured D/H, which have d>500 pc and log N(H I)>20.5, suggest a
significantly lower value for the true local-disk gas-phase D/H value,
(D/H)_LDg=(0.85+/-0.09)e-5. One interpretation of these results is that D is
preferentially depleted onto dust grains relative to H and that longer lines of
sight that extend beyond the Local Bubble sample more depleted material. In
this scenario, the higher Local Bubble D/H ratio is actually a better estimate
than (D/H)_LDg for the true local-disk D/H, D/H)_LD. However, if (D/H)_LDg is
different from (D/H)_LBg simply because of variable astration and incomplete
ISM mixing, then (D/H)_LD=(D/H)_LDg.

profiles observed towards Galactic Center Sources (GCS) 3 and 4, which are
C-rich Wolf-Rayet Stars, as reference objects, we are able to disentangle the
interstellar silicate absorption and the silicate emission intrinsic to the
source, toward Sgr A* and derive a very accurate profile for the intrinsic 9.7
micron band. The interstellar absorption band is smooth and featureless and is
well reproduced using a mixture of 15.1% amorphous pyroxene and 84.9% of
amorphous olivine by mass, all in spherical sub-micron-sized grains. There is
no direct evidence for substructure due to interstellar crystalline silicates.
We are able to determine an upper limit to the degree of crystallinity of
silicates in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), and conclude that the
crystalline fraction of the interstellar silicates is 0.2% (+/- 0.2%) by mass.
This is much lower than the degree of crystallinity observed in silicates in
the circumstellar environment of evolved stars, the main contributors of dust
to the ISM. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, an
amorphization process occurs in the ISM on a time scale significantly shorter
than the destruction time scale, possibly caused by particle bombardment by
heavyweight ions. Second, we consider the possibility that the crystalline
silicates in stellar ejecta are diluted by an additional source of amorphous
silicates, in particular supernovae.

period in 1997 August, not long after the 1997 periastron, and a significant
frequency second derivative indicating timing noise. We find that spin-orbit
coupling with secular changes in periastron longitude and projected semi-major

data set. While fitting the data fairly well, changes in pulsar period
parameters at each periastron seem ruled out both by X-ray observations and by
the large apparent changes in pulsar frequency derivative. Essentially all of
the systematic period variations are accounted for by a model consisting of the
1997 August glitch and step changes in $x$ at each periastron. These changes
must be due to changes in the orbit inclination, but we can find no plausible
mechanism to account for them. It is possible that timing noise may mask the
actual changes in orbital parameters at each periastron, but the good fit to

populations of ages < 10^7 and ~ 10^8 yr respectively, their ratio
f(Halpha)/f(UV) provides us with a tool to study the recent t < 10^8 yr star
formation history of galaxies, an exercise that we present here applied to 98
galaxies in 4 nearby clusters (Virgo, Coma, Abell 1367 and Cancer). The
observed f(Halpha)/f(UV) ratio is ~ a factor of two smaller than the expected
one as determined from population synthesis models assuming a realistic
delayed, exponentially declining star formation history. We discuss various
mechanisms that may have affected the observed f(Halpha)/f(UV) ratio and we
propose that the above discrepancy arises from either the absorption of Lyman
continuum photons by dust within the star formation regions or from the
occurrence of star formation episodes. After splitting our sample into
different subsamples according to evolutionary criteria we find that our
reference sample of galaxies unaffected by the cluster environment show an
average value of f(Halpha)/f(UV) two times lower than the expected one. We
argue that this difference must be mostly due to absorption of ~ 45% of the
Lyman continuum photons within star forming regions. Galaxies with clear signs
of an ongoing interaction show average values of f(Halpha)/f(UV) slightly
higher than the reference value, as expected if those objects had SFR increased
by a factor of ~ 4. The accuracy of the current UV and Halpha photometry is not
yet sufficient to clearly disentangle the effect of interactions on the
f(Halpha)/f(UV) ratio, but significant observational improvements are shortly
expected to result from the GALEX mission.

derive a model Hamiltonian of Coulomb interactions which includes both the
long-range part v_q and the short-range part U. It is found from the expression
of the dielectric function that the strong on-site correlations weaken the
Coulomb screening. Secondly, we examine the screened phonons and the
interaction mediated by phonons. In a consistent picture, we derive an
expression of the effective interaction which includes (1) the screened Coulomb
interactions, (2) the pairing interactions mediated by phonons, and (3) the
effective interactions mediated by spin and charge fluctuations. It is
rewritten in a form of a summation of (a) the effective interactions of the
pure Hubbard model without the long-range Coulomb interactions, and (b) the
phonon-mediated interactions plus screened Coulomb interactions with
corrections due to both U and v_q. Thirdly, we derive an effective Hamiltonian
analogous to the BCS Hamiltonian. Fourthly, for some typical values of
parameters, we obtain the ground state phase diagrams. It is found that
spin-triplet superconductivity mediated by phonons occurs when the short-range
electron correlations are sufficiently strong, and the Coulomb screening is
sufficiently weak. We estimate the orders of the transition temperatures when
the triplet superconductivity occurs. The obtained values are realistic for
existing candidates of the triplet superconductors as the order of the
magnitudes. The possible relevance of the phonon-mediated interactions to the
heavy fermion superconductor UPt_3 and the layered superconductors such

potentials (DWP) and thus two-level systems on a systematic basis. We show that
the intrinsic limitations of computer simulations like finite time and finite
size problems do not hamper this analysis. We discuss how the DWP are embedded
in the total potential energy landscape. It turns out that most DWP are
connected to the dynamics of the smaller particles and that these DWP are
rather localized. However, DWP related to the larger particles are more
collective.

  Felice, A. Pascolini. Vol.1, p. 609",,,"gr-qc",,"  The Energy Problem (EP) in General Relativity (GR) is analyzed in the context
of GR's axiomatic inconsistencies. EP is classified according to its local and
global aspects. The local aspects of the EP include noncovariance of the
energy-momentum pseudotensor (EMPT) of the gravitational field, non-uniqueness
of the EMPT, asymmetry of EMPT, and vanishing metric energy-momentum tensor.
The global aspect of the EP relates to the lack of integral conservation laws
due to the general difficulties in defining invariant integrals of tensors in
non-Euclidean space. These difficulties are related to the lack of precise
definition of a reference frame in the GR. A reference frame is defined here as
a differential manifold with an affine connection. The resulting unique
decomposition of the Levi-Civita connection into its affine and nonmetric parts
allows for a covariant definition of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor.
It is pointed out that the invariance of the Lagrangian (or action functional)
is a necessary but not sufficient condition to secure the covariance of the
Lagrange-Euler field theory. A rigorous definition of the Lagrange Field
Structure (LFS) on differential manifolds is proposed. A covariant
generalization of the first Noether theorem for LFS is obtained. Different
approaches to the EP are discussed.

an effective string description for QCD. For light meson states the

that the allowed modifications to the linear Regge behavior must decrease

mid-rapidity at RHIC energy, the effects of parton saturation are constrained
to transverse momenta below the saturation scale $p_T \leq Q_s$; in this case
the back-to-back correlations do not disappear but exhibit broadening. However
when near-side and away-side hadrons are separated by several units of
rapidity, quantum evolution effects lead to the depletion of back-to-back
correlations as a function of rapidity interval between the detected hadrons
(at fixed $p_T$). This applies to both $pp$ and $pA$ (or $dA$) collisions;
however, due to the initial conditions provided by the Color Glass Condensate,
the depletion of the back-to-back correlations is significantly stronger in the

principles, it becomes possible to focus on the bare minimum of requirements
that such a theory must satisfy. The abstraction is based on a survey of the
progress that has been achieved since relativistic wave equations for higher
spin fields were first considered in the nineteen thirties. As a byproduct, a
formalism is obtained that is abstract enough to describe a wide class of
classical field theories. The formalism, viewed as syntax, can then be
semantically mapped to a category of homotopy Lie algebras, thus showing that
the theory in some sense exists, at least as an abstract mathematical
structure. Still, a concrete physics-like, implementation remains to be
constructed. Lacking deep physical insight into the problem, an implementation
in terms of generalized vertex operators is set up within which a brute force
iterative determination of the first few orders in the interaction can be
attempted.

of this paper is to systematically develop a homotopy theory of pro-spectra and
to study its relation to the usual homotopy theory of spectra, as a foundation
for future applications. The surprising result we find is that our homotopy
theory of pro-spectra is Quillen equivalent to the opposite of the homotopy
theory of spectra. This provides a convenient duality theory for all spectra,
extending the classical notion of Spanier-Whitehead duality which works well
only for finite spectra. Roughly speaking, the new duality functor takes a
spectrum to the cofiltered diagram of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of its finite
subcomplexes. In the other direction, the duality functor takes a cofiltered
diagram of spectra to the filtered colimit of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of
the spectra in the diagram. We prove the equivalence of homotopy theories by
showing that both are equivalent to the category of ind-spectra (filtered
diagrams of spectra).
  To construct our new homotopy theories, we prove a general existence theorem
for colocalization model structures generalizing known results for cofibrantly
generated model categories.

numerically for integrate-and-fire neurons. Several known key properties of
orientation selective cortical neurons emerge naturally from the description:
Irregular firing with statistics close to -- but not restricted to -- Poisson
statistics; an almost linear gain function (firing frequency as a function of
stimulus contrast) of the neurons within the network; and a contrast-invariant
tuning width of the neuronal firing. We find that the irregularity in firing
depends sensitively on synaptic strengths. If Fano factors are bigger than 1,
then they are so for all stimulus orientations that elicit firing. We also find
that the tuning of the noise in the input current is the same as the tuning of
the external input, while that for the mean input current depends on both the

grows in ""steps"" with the possible values $ d, d+1, ..., d^2-2 $. We also find
that states with less entanglement can have greater communication capacity than
other more entangled states.

A 70, 032310 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.70.032310",,"quant-ph",,"  The problem of the estimation of multiple phases (or of commuting unitaries)
is considered. This is a sub-model of the estimation of a completely unknown
unitary operation where it has been shown in recent works that there are
considerable improvements by using entangled input states and entangled
measurements. Here it is shown that when estimating commuting unitaries, there
is practically no advantage in using entangled input states or entangled
measurements.
