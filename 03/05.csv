independent problems: the abundance of substructure in dark matter halos, and
the cuspiness of the halos' inner density profile. We explore possible
connections between the two problems by studying the gravitational scattering
effects due to subhalos on the phase-space distribution of dark matter
particles in the main halos. Our series of controlled numerical experiments
indicates that the number and mass density of subhalos can be high enough to
cause the collisionless dark matter particles in the inner part of a main halo
to diffuse, flattening the main halo's inner cusp within a few dynamical times.
Depending on the masses and concentration of the subhalos, the inner density
profile of the whole system (main plus sub halos) can either steepen or
flatten. Subhalo accretion can therefore introduce significant scatter in the
inner density profiles of dark matter halos, offering a possible explanation
for the range of profiles seen in both observations and cosmological
simulations.

galaxies spanning three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity at redshift
z~0.5 are presented. The full sample is drawn from four complete, low-frequency
selected radio samples with progressively fainter flux-density limits (3CRR,
6CE, 7CRS and the new TexOx-1000 sample). Modelling of the HST imaging data
shows that the host galaxies have surface-brightness distributions consistent
with those expected for classic ellipticals (Sersic parameter, beta~0.25), with
beta in the range 0.17<beta<0.30, and a mean of <beta>=0.23\pm0.01. The
host-galaxy luminosities are comparable with those of galaxies drawn from the
bright end of the local cluster galaxy luminosity function, spanning the range
0.7L^{\star}<L<10L^{\star}, with a mean of 3.2\pm0.3 L^{\star}. In addition,
the radio galaxies are shown to follow a Kormendy relation indistinguishable
from that of powerful low-redshift radio galaxies. Combining our new results
with those in the literature it is found that the scalelengths and Kormendy
relations of 3C-class radio galaxies do not vary significantly over the
redshift range 0.0<z<0.8, providing no evidence for dynamical evolution of this
class of host galaxy within this redshift interval. Converting the host-galaxy
luminosities into black-hole mass estimates predicts that the radio galaxies
harbour central black holes with masses in the range 10^{8.1}\Msun <M_{bh}<
10^{9.5}\Msun, with a geometric mean of <M_{bh}>=10^{8.87\pm 0.04}\Msun.
Finally, a significant (~3 sigma) correlation is found between black-hole mass
and 151-MHz radio luminosity for those objects in the sample with either
high-excitation nuclear spectra or classical double radio structures.

truncation radius in the disk. Unusually strong HI, H-alpha and radio continuum
emission are all detected from the extraplanar gas. The radio continuum
polarized flux and spectral index peak on the side opposite the extraplanar
gas, suggesting ongoing pressure by the ICM. Four other HI-deficient edge-on
Virgo spirals show evidence of extraplanar ISM gas or exhibit asymmetries in
their disk HI distributions, but contain much less extraplanar HI than NGC
4522. Comparison with recent simulations suggests this difference may be
evolutionary, with large surface densities of extraplanar gas observed only in
early phases of an ICM-ISM interaction. In NGC 4569, the H-alpha image shows 2
effects of ICM pressure on the galaxy ISM. An anomalous arm of HII regions,
possibly extraplanar, emerges from the edge of a truncated H-alpha disk. This
resembles the arms seen in simulations which are formed by the combined effects
of wind pressure plus rotation. An extended nebulosity near the minor axis,
also in the NW, is interpreted as a starburst outflow bubble disturbed by ICM
wind pressure.

around nearby young stars belonging to the beta Pic (t~12 Myr) and the Local
Association (t~50 Myr) moving groups. Unlike most past sub-mm studies, our
sample was chosen on the basis of stellar age. Our observations achieve about
an order of magnitude greater sensitivity in dust mass compared to previous
work in this age range. We detected two of the three M dwarfs in our sample at
850 um, GJ 182 and GJ 803. GJ 182 may also possess a 25 um excess, indicative
of warm dust in the inner few AU of its disk. For GJ 803 (AU Mic), sub-mm
mapping finds that the 850 um emission is unresolved. A non-detection of the CO
3-2 line indicates the system is gas-poor, and the SED suggests the presence of
a large inner disk hole (~17 AU = 1.7 arcsec in radius). These are possible
indications that planets at large separations can form around M dwarfs within
\~10 Myr. In a companion paper (Kalas, Liu & Matthews 2004), we confirm the
existence of a dust disk around GJ 803 using optical coronagraphic imaging.
Given its youthfulness, proximity, and detectability, the GJ 803 disk will be a
valuable system for studying disk, and perhaps planet, formation in great
detail. Overall, sub-mm measurements of debris disks point to a drop in dust
mass by a factor of about 10^3 within the first ~10 Myr, with the subsequent
decline in the masses of sub-mm detected disks consistent with t^{-0.5} to
t^{-1}.

of recent star formation activity are only found in 20% of the subsample, even
though older red stars still dominate the stellar populations in these

nature of the emission lines in the galaxies where they were detected, we
suggest that nuclear star formation proceeds in the form of instantaneous
bursts. The stars produced by these bursts comprise only ~2% of the total
nuclear stellar mass in these galaxies, but we demonstrate how the nuclear
stellar populations of normal spiral galaxies can be built up through a series
of these bursts. The bursts were detected only in Sbc galaxies and later, and
both bars and interactions appeared to be sufficient but not necessary triggers
for the nuclear star formation activity. The vast majority of galaxies with
nuclear star formation were classified as HII galaxies. With one exception,
LINERs and transition objects were dominated by older red stars, which
suggested that star formation was not responsible for generating these

and collapse does not occur. In supercritical boxes, some cores collapse, being
part of larger clumps that are supercritical from the start, and whose central,
densest regions (the cores) are initially subcritical, but rapidly become
supercritical, presumably by accretion along field lines. Numerical artifacts
are ruled out. The time scales for cores to go from subcritical to
supercritical and then collapse are a few times the core free-fall time,
$\tfc$. Our results suggest that cores are out-of-equilibrium, transient
structures, rather than quasi-magnetostatic configurations.

phase-space density $f(x,v)$ in an N-body system, and derive its distribution
function $v(f)$. The method is based on Delaunay tessellation, where $v(f)$ is
obtained with an effective fixed smoothing window over a wide $f$ range. The
errors are estimated, and $v(f)$ is found to be insensitive to the sampling
resolution or the simulation technique. We find that in gravitationally relaxed
haloes built by hierarchical clustering, $v(f)$ is well approximated by a
robust power law, $v(f) \propto f^{-2.5 \pm 0.05}$, over more than 4 decades in
$f$, from its virial level to the numerical resolution limit. This is tested to
be valid in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology for haloes with masses
$10^9-10^{15}\msun$, indicating insensitivity to the slope of the initial
fluctuation power spectrum. By mapping the phase-space density in position
space, we find that the high-$f$ end of $v(f)$ is dominated by the ``cold''
subhaloes rather than the parent-halo central region and its global spherical
profile. The value of $f$ in subhaloes near the virial radius is typically
$>100$ times higher than its value at the halo centre, and it decreases
gradually from outside in toward its value at the halo centre. This seems to
reflect phase mixing due to mergers and tidal effects involving puffing up and
heating. The phase-space density can thus provide a sensitive tool for studying
the evolution of subhaloes during the hierarchical buildup of haloes. It
remains to be understood why the evolved substructure adds up to the actual
universal power law of $v(f) \propto f^{-2.5}$. It seems that this behaviour
results from the hierarchical clustering process and is not a general result of
violent relaxation.

accreted GCs. By contrast, we find that the age-metallicity relation (AMR) of

at intermediate-to-high metallicities ([Fe/H] > -1.3). The accretion of GCs
with a distinct AMR would explain much of the apparent age spread in the

of other Local Group dwarf galaxies and are consistent with a simple closed-box

pre-main sequence stars with intrinsic color excesses. We find that the slope
of the Ks-band luminosity function of W3 Main is lower than the typical values
reported for the young embedded clusters. The derived slope of the KLF is the
same as that found by Megeath et al. (1996), from which analysis by Megeath et

sphere of the central black hole. This leads to a constant density profile of
bright stars in projection, which rules out the presence of intermediate mass
black holes in core collapse clusters. If the star clusters are surrounded by a
tidal field, a central IMBH speeds up the destruction of the cluster until a
remnant of a few hundred stars remains, which stays bound to the IMBH for a
long time. We also discuss the efficiency of different detection mechanisms for
finding IMBHs in star clusters.

if the observed X-ray variability is the initial part of an X-ray cycle, this

Sc spirals are more frequent among IsG, and S0s among perturbed galaxies. IsG
appear to be smaller, less luminous and bluer than interacting objects. We also
found that bars are twice as frequent among perturbed galaxies in particular
for early S and S0. The perturbed galaxies have higher L$_{FIR}$/L$_B$ and
M$_{mol}$/L$_B$ ratios, but the atomic gas content is similar for the two

being the almost total absence of big, bright and massive galaxies among the

the perturbed systems. The evolution induced by interactions, would therefore
proceed from late, small, faint and low mass S to earlier, bigger, more
luminous and more massive S and S0 galaxies, producing at the same time a

relative elemental abundance ratios of r- and \alpha- elements in all the
accreted stars differ sharply from those in the stars that are genetically
associated with the Galaxy. According to current theoretical models, europium
is produced mainly in low mass Type II supernovae (SNe II), while magnesium is
synthesized in larger amounts in high mass SN II progenitors. Since all the old
accreted stars of our sample exhibit a significant Eu overabundance relative to
Mg, we conclude that the maximum masses of the SNII progenitors outside the
Galaxy were much lower than those inside it are. On the other hand, only a
small number of young accreted stars exhibit low negative ratios $[Eu/Mg] < 0$.
The delay of primordial star formation burst and the explosions of high mass
SNe II in a relatively small part of extragalactic space can explain this
situation. We provide evidence that the interstellar medium was weakly mixed at
the early evolutionary stages of the Galaxy formed from a single proto-galactic
cloud and that the maximum mass of the SN II progenitors increased in it with
time simultaneously with the increase in mean metallicity.

present data does not allow us to reach a firm conclusion. The rest frame NH
derived from XMM and Chandra data as quoted in the literature are in good
agreement with the BeppoSAX estimates. For the same GRB afterglow sample we
evaluated the rest frame visual extinction AVr. We fitted the optical-NIR
afterglow photometry with a power law model corrected by four different
extinction curves. By comparing X-ray absorptions and optical extinction, we
found that if a Galactic-like dust grain size distribution is assumed, a dust
to gas ratio lower than the one observed in the Galaxy is required by the data.
A dust to gas ratio 1/10 than the Galactic one, has been tested using the Small

boundary of a molecular cloud were detected. Beside high rotation measures and
unusual spectral indices of the polarized intensity, these features are
associated with the molecular gas. At the higher frequencies the minima get
less distinct. We have modelled the multi-frequency observations by placing
magneto-ionic Faraday screens at the distance of the molecular cloud. In this
model Faraday rotated background emission adds to foreground emission towards
these screens. The systematic variation of the observed properties is the
result of different line-of-sight lengths through the screen assuming spherical
symmetry. For a distance of 140 pc to the Taurus clouds the physical sizes of
the Faraday screens are of the order of 2 pc. In this paper we describe the
data calibration and modelling process for one such object. We find an
intrinsic rotation measure of about -29 rad/m^{2} to model the observations. It
is pointed out that the observed rotation measure differs from the physical.
Further observational constraints from H-alpha observations limit the thermal
electron density to less than 0.8 cm^{-3}, and we conclude that the regular
magnetic field strength parallel to the line-of-sight exceeds 20 micro Gauss to
account for the intrinsic rotation measure.

whether they could host terrestrial like planets in their habitable zones
(=HZ). First we investigated the mean motion resonances between fictitious
terrestrial planets and the existing gas giants in these five extrasolar
systems. Then a fine grid of initial conditions for a potential terrestrial
planet within the HZ was chosen for each system, from which the stability of
orbits was then assessed by direct integrations over a time interval of 1
million years. The computations were carried out using a Lie-series integration
method with an adaptive step size control. This integration method achieves
machine precision accuracy in a highly efficient and robust way, requiring no
special adjustments when the orbits have large eccentricities. The stability of
orbits was examined with a determination of the Renyi entropy, estimated from
recurrence plots, and with a more straight forward method based on the maximum
eccentricity achieved by the planet over the 1 million year integration.
Additionally, the eccentricity is an indication of the habitability of a
terrestrial planet in the HZ; any value of e>0.2 produces a significant
temperature difference on a planet's surface between apoapse and periapse. The
results for possible stable orbits for terrestrial planets in habitable zones
for the five systems are summarized as follows: for Gl 777 A nearly the entire

nights spread over 6 months in 2001-2002. Coordinated broad-band photometric
observations were also obtained for some targets. Conspicuous evidence for
variability in H\alpha is found for the stars displaying a feature contaminated
by wind emission. Most changes take place on a daily time-scale, although
hourly variations are also occasionally detected. Convincing evidence for a
cyclical pattern of variability in H\alpha has been found in 2 stars: HD 14134
and HD 42087 (periodic signals are also detected in other stars, but
independent confirmation is required). Rotational modulation is suggested from
the similarity between the observed recurrence time-scales (in the range 13-25
days) and estimated periods of stellar rotation. We call attention to the
atypical case of HD 14134 which exhibits a clear 12.8-d periodicity both in the
photometric and in the spectroscopic data sets. This places this object among a
handful of early-type stars where one may observe a clear link between extended
wind structures and photospheric disturbances. Further modelling may test the
hypothesis that azimuthally-extended wind streams are responsible for the
patterns of spectral variability in our target stars.

the data for nearly armchair nanotubes obey a nonlinear scaling relation as a
function the tube radius $R$. We show that these effects can be understood in a
theory of large radius tubes, derived from the theory of two dimensional
graphene where the coulomb interaction leads to a logarithmic correction to the
electronic self energy and marginal Fermi liquid behavior. Interactions on
length scales larger than the tube circumference lead to strong self energy and
excitonic effects that compete and nearly cancel so that the observed optical
transitions are dominated by the graphene self energy effects.

the sum of two components, the major one showing a C_P/T=gamma_0 -gamma_1

\cite{inselberg85plane}, a surface $\sigma$ was represented as the {\em
envelope} of the polygonal lines representing it's points. This is ambiguous in
the sense that {\em different} surfaces can provide the {\em same} envelopes.
Here the ambiguity is eliminated by considering the surface $\sigma$ as the
envelope of it's {\em tangent planes} and in turn, representing each of these
planes by $n$-1 points \cite{Insel99a}. This, with some future extension, can
yield a new and unambiguous representation, $\bar{\sigma}$, of the surface
consisting of $n$-1 planar regions whose properties correspond lead to the {\em

  It is further shown that the image (i.e. representation) of an algebraic
surface of degree 2 in $\Real^n$ is a region whose boundary is also an
algebraic curve of degree 2. This includes some {\em non-convex} surfaces which
with the previous ambiguous representation could not be treated. An efficient
construction algorithm for the representation of the quadratic surfaces (given
either by {\em explicit} or {\em implicit} equation) is provided. The results
obtained are suitable for applications, to be presented in a future paper, and
in particular for the approximation of complex surfaces based on their {\em

``over-plotting'' problem i.e. the ``bunching'' of polygonal lines which often

Coordinates is constructed from the point $\leftrightarrow$ line duality. The
result is a ``line-curve'' which is seen as the envelope of it's tangents.
Usually this gives an unclear image and is at the heart of the
``over-plotting'' problem; a barrier in the effective use of Parallel
Coordinates. This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides
directly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was
applied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also
called dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is
shown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of
degree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that
conics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on
algebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained
which constructs the dual image of the curve. This approach has potential
generalizations to multi-dimensional algebraic surfaces and their
approximation. The ``trade-off'' price then for obtaining {\em planar}
representation of multidimensional algebraic curves and hyper-surfaces is the
higher degree of the image's boundary which is also an algebraic curve in

are supported by two independent procedures; one based on the regularity of the

bifurcate Killing horizon. It is then argued that geometrical symmetries will
severely constrain the matter near any Killing horizon. We also speculate on

very large scattering lengths for the quarks. These resonances have been found
in lattice simulation of QCD using the maximum entropy method (MEM). We have
used a chiral quark model, which provides a simple representation of effects
due to instanton dynamics, to study the resonances obtained using the MEM

with the existence of three twisted sectors in this class. In this work we seek
an improved understanding of the geometrical origin of the three generation

Z2XZ2 orbifold with symmetric shifts on six dimensional compactified internal
manifolds. We show that perturbative three generation models are not obtained
in the case of Z2XZ2 orbifolds with symmetric shifts on complex tori, and that
the perturbative three generation models in this class necessarily employ an
asymmetric shift. We present a class of three generation models in which the
SO(10) gauge symmetry cannot be broken perturbatively, while preserving the
Standard Model matter content. We discuss the potential implications of the
asymmetric shift for strong-weak coupling duality and moduli stabilization. We
show that the freedom in the modular invariant phases in the N=1 vacua that
control the chiral content, can be interpreted as vacuum expectation values of
background fields of the underlying N=4 theory, whose dynamical components are
projected out by the Z2-fermionic projections. In this class of vacua the
chiral content of the models is determined by the underlying N=4 mother theory.

techniques, a detailed knowledge of oligomer structure at the atomic level is
missing. We introduce a molecular dynamics approach to study Abeta dimer
formation: (1) we use discrete molecular dynamics simulations of a

employ all-atom molecular mechanics simulations to estimate the thermodynamic
stability of all dimer conformations. Our simulations of a coarse-grained Abeta
peptide model predicts ten different planar beta-strand dimer conformations. We
then estimate the free energies of all dimer conformations in all-atom
molecular mechanics simulations with explicit water. We compare the free
energies of Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40) dimers. We find that (a) all dimer
conformations have higher free energies compared to their corresponding
monomeric states, and (b) the free energy difference between the Abeta(1-42)

0.2x0.2 $mm^{2}$ ``narrow'' beam, 4 different 20 mm long scanning beams of
various widths, and a 20x100 $mm^{2}$ beam with no scatter reduction mechanisms

to 2 cm away from the object (for 4 cm thick phantom), we identify the
background definition as a main source of systematic uncertainty in the image
quality analysis. We propose the use of two dimensional functions (a polynomial
for the background and Gaussians for the signal) for total photon transmission
description. Our main results indicate the possible calcification thickness
reconstruction with an accuracy of the order of 6% using 3 mm wide scanning

Thickness reconstruction is shown to be an alternative to signal-to-noise ratio

the rate sum for irreducible sources of product states which is stronger than
the one given by a naive application of Slepian-Wolf. Nonetheless, strategies
taking advantage of correlation do exist for some special classes of quantum
sources. For example, Devetak and Winter demonstrated the existence of such a
strategy when one of the sources is classical. Here we find optimal non-trivial
strategies for a different extreme, sources of Bell states. In addition, we
illustrate how distributed compression is connected to other problems in

understanding of entanglement applicable to a full variety of physical
settings? It is clear that not only the assumption of distinguishability, but
also the few-subsystem scenario, are too narrow to embrace all possible

subsystem-based framework becomes manifest when one tries to apply the
conventional concept of entanglement to the physics of matter, since the
constituents of a quantum many-body system are indistinguishable particles. We
shall discuss here a notion of generalized entanglement, which can be applied
to any operator language (fermions, bosons, spins, etc.) used to describe a
physical system and which includes the conventional entanglement settings
introduced to date in a unified fashion. This is realized by noticing that
entanglement is an observer-dependent concept, whose properties are determined
by the expectations of a distinguished set of observables without reference to
a preferred subsystem decomposition, i.e., it depends on the physically
relevant point of view. This viewpoint depends in turn upon the relationship
between different sets of observables that determine our ability to control the
system of interest. Indeed, the extent to which entanglement is present depends
on the observables used to measure a system and describe its states. This
represents a most conspicuous advantage as will be highlighted by the
condensed-matter application we will discuss.

in this paper. The security of the protocol relies on the existence of quantum
one-way functions by quantum information theorem. This protocol involves a
so-called arbitrator who validates and authenticates the signed message. In
this protocol, we use privacy key algorithm to ensure the security of quantum
information on channel and use quantum public keys to sign message. To
guarantee the authenticity of the message, a family of quantum stabilizer codes
are employed. Our protocol presents a novel method to construct ultimately
secure digital system in future secure communication.

possible application to difficult problem in classical calculation. Despite the
experimental problems of implementing quantum devices, theoretical physicists
have tried to conceive some implementations for quantum algorithms. We present
here some explicit schemes for executing elementary arithmetic operations.

  Non-adiabatic Transition","5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We, based on the photoassociation of fermion atoms into bosonic molecules,
propose a scheme to create the steady entanglement between the atom state and
the molecule state inside an optical lattice. The stability of entanglement
state is guaranteed by sweeping the frequency of Ramman laser beam through
resonance according to the second Demkov-Kunike (DK2) nonadiabatic transition
model\cite{DK,models}. The probability amplitude of each components can be
precisely controlled by adjusting the sweeping parameter.
