interferometer LISA could detect intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, that
is, binaries containing a black hole in the mass range 10 -- 100 Msun orbiting
a black hole in the mass range 100 -- 1000 Msun. For one-year integrations
leading up to the innermost stable orbit, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, we
estimate a detection rate of only 1 per million years for 10 Msun/100 Msun
binaries. The estimate uses the method of parameter estimation via matched
filtering, incorporates a noise curve for LISA established by the LISA Science
Team that is available online, and employs an IMBH formation rate model used by
Miller (2002). We find that the detectable distance is relatively insensitive
to LISA arm lengths or acceleration noise, but is roughly inversely
proportional to LISA position errors, and varies roughly as T^(1/2), where T is
the integration time in years. We also show that, while all IMBH systems in
this mass range may be detected in the Virgo cluster up to 40 years before
merger, none can be detected there earlier than 400 years before merger. An
extended LISA mission that enabled 10-year integrations could detect IMBH
systems at the Virgo cluster 1000 years before merger, and systems in galactic
globular clusters a million years before merger. We compare and contrast these
estimates with earlier estimates by Miller (2002).

morphologies, while the rest have structures characteristic of late-type
(disk-dominated) galaxies. We find that 25% of the early types, and 30% of the
late types, exhibit disturbances consistent with galaxy interactions. The hosts
show a wide range of colors, from those of red-sequence galaxies to blue colors
consistent with ongoing star formation. Roughly 70% of the morphologically
early-type hosts have rest-frame blue colors, a much larger fraction than those
typical of non-active morphologically early-type galaxies in this redshift and
luminosity range. Yet, we find that the early-type hosts are structurally
similar to red-sequence ellipticals, inasmuch as they follow an absolute
magnitude versus half-light size correlation that are consistent with the mean
relation for early-type galaxies at similar redshifts.

position-dependent mutual slide of monolayers and bending deformation. Our free
energy functional of liquid-crystalline membrane allows for incompressibility
of the membrane and vanishing of the in-plane shear modulus and obeys
reflectional and rotational symmetries of the flat bilayer. Interlayer slide at
the mid-plane of the membrane results in local difference of surface densities
of the monolayers. The slide amplitude directly enters free energy via the
strain tensor. For small bending deformations the ratio between bending modulus
and area compression coefficient, Kb/KA, is proportional to the square of
monolayer thickness, h. Using the functional we performed self-consistent
calculation of steric potential acting on bilayer between parallel confining
walls separated by distance 2d. We found that temperature-dependent curvature
at the minimum of confining potential is enhanced four times for a bilayer with
slide as compared with a unit bilayer. We also calculate viscous modes of
bilayer membrane between confining walls. Pure bending of the membrane is
investigated, which is decoupled from area dilation at small amplitudes. Three
sources of viscous dissipation are considered: water and membrane viscosities
and interlayer drag. Dispersion has two branches. Confinement between the walls
modifies the bending mode with respect to membrane in bulk solution.
Simultaneously, inter-layer slipping mode, damped by viscous drag, remains
unchanged by confinement.

  Model","PhD. thesis (169 pages, 1 tex file, 89 ps and eps files, for better
  resolution images of Figures 1.1-1.4 contact the author)",,,,"nlin.AO",,"  I analyse a model of an evolving network represented as a directed graph;
each node corresponds to one molecular species and the links to catalytic
interactions between species. Over short timescales the graph remains fixed
while relative populations of the molecular species change according to a set
of coupled differential equations. Over long timescales the system is subject
to periodic perturbations, each of which adds one new node to the graph, with
random links to other nodes, and removes one node with the least relative
population. Starting from a sparse random graph, a small autocatalytic set
(ACS) inevitably forms and then grows by accreting nodes until it spans the
entire graph. The resultant fully autocatalytic graph, whose probability of
forming by pure chance is very small, nevertheless forms in this model in an
average time that grows only logarithmically with the size of the system. ACSs
can also get destroyed, often accompanied by the sudden extinction of a large
number of species. I show that the largest of the extinction events in this
model are caused by one of three mechanisms, each of which produces a specific
discontinuous change in the graph's topology. The model is analytically
tractable: two theorems are proved which determine the set of nodes with least
relative population in the attractor, for any given graph. This in turn can be
used to analytically demonstrate the inevitability of the formation and growth
of ACSs and calculate the associated timescales. Finally, I show that the
formation and growth of ACSs is robust to the relaxation of many of the
idealizations made to enhance the analytical tractability of the model.

nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions at CERN SPS (sqrt(s_NN)~20 GeV) is revisited
and systematically compared to all existing proton-proton data in the same
range of center-of-mass energies. The ratio of A+A to p+p pion cross-sections
(nuclear modification factor) for 0-8% central Pb+Pb, Pb+Au and S+Au reactions
does not show a strong enhancement as a function of p_T as previously found,
but is consistent with scaling with the number of nucleon-nucleon (NN)
collisions. Neutral pion yields per NN collision in head-on Pb+Pb reactions are
suppressed, whereas peripheral yields are enhanced. These results together
indicate that some amount of ``jet quenching'' may already be present in
central heavy-ion reactions at sqrt(s_NN)~20 GeV.

Strutinsky method, the shell energy is evaluated by an averaging over the
number of particles and not over the single-particle energies, which is more
consistent with the definition of the macroscopic energy. In addition, the
smooth background is subtracted before averaging the sum of single-particle
energies, which significantly improves the plateau condition and allows to
apply the method also for nuclei close to the proton or neutron drip lines. A
significant difference between the shell correction energy obtained with the
traditional and the new method is found in particular for highly degenerated
single-particle spectra (as i.e. in magic nuclei) while for deformed nuclei
(where the degeneracy is lifted to a large extent) both estimates are close,
except in the region of super or hyper-deformed states.

  via a noncoplanar fiber system","4 pages, Latex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A new scheme of realizing the nonadiabatic conditional geometric phase shift
via a noncoplanar (and coiled) fiber system is presented in this Letter. It is
shown that the effective Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of
polarized photons with the fiber medium is just the Wang-Keiji type of
Hamiltonian. This, therefore, means that the coiled fiber system may be an
ideal implementation of realizing the nonadiabatic geometric phase gates for
the topological quantum computation. The remarkable feature of the present
method is that it can automatically meet the conditions and requirements
proposed in the Wang-Keiji scheme: (i) in the coiled fiber system, the
dynamical phase of photon wavefunction caused by the interaction Hamiltonian
automatically vanishes; (ii) the Wang-Keiji requirement for the parameters in
the Wang-Keiji Hamiltonian can be exactly satisfied automatically in the fiber
system; (iii) the conditional initial state can be easily achieved by
manipulating the initial wave vector of polarized photons. Due to these three
advantages, the coiled fiber system may be a potentially practical way of
achieving the nonadiabatic conditional geometric phase shift (and hence the
nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates).
