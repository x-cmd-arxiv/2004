this field includes the region studied by Mould & Kristian in their 1986 paper.
The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) extends to I~25 and shows a prominent red
giant branch (RGB), along with significant numbers of asymptotic giant branch
and young main sequence stars. The red clump of core helium burning stars is
also discernable near the limit of our CMD. The I-band apparent magnitude of
the red giant branch tip implies a distance modulus of (m-M)_I = 24.77 +/-
0.06, which combined with an adopted reddening of E(V-I)=0.06 +/- 0.02 yields
an absolute modulus of (m-M)_0 = 24.69 +/- 0.07 (867 +/- 28 kpc) for M33. Over
the range of deprojected radii covered by our field (~8.5 to ~12.5 kpc), we
find a significant age gradient with an upper limit of ~1 Gyr (~0.25 Gyr/kpc).
Comparison of the RGB photometry to empirical giant branch sequences for
Galactic globulars allows us to use the dereddened color of these stars to
construct a metallicity distribution function (MDF). The primary peak in the
MDF is at a metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.0 with a tail to lower abundances. The
peak does show radial variation with a slope of d[Fe/H]/dR_{deproj} = -0.06 +/-
0.01 dex/kpc. This gradient is consistent with the variation seen in the inner
disk regions of M33. As such, we conclude that the vast majority of stars in
this field belong to the disk of M33, not the halo as previously thought.

($\nu_a \to \nu_s$) neutrino ($\nu$) oscillations can take place during the
core bounce of a supernova collapse. Besides, over this phase, weak magnetism
increases antineutrino ($\bar{\nu}$) mean free paths, and thus its luminosity.
Because the oscillation feeds mass-energy into the target $\nu$ species, the
large mass-squared difference between species ($\nu_a \to \nu_s$) implies a
huge amount of energy to be given off as gravitational waves ($L_{\textrm{GWs}}
\sim 10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$), due to anisotropic but coherent $\nu$ flow over
the oscillation length. This asymmetric $\nu$-flux is driven by both the
spin-magnetic and the {\it universal spin-rotation} coupling. The novel
contribution of this paper stems from 1) the new computation of the anisotropy
parameter $\alpha \sim 0.1-0.01$, and 2) the use of the tight constraints from
neutrino experiments as SNO and KamLAND, and the cosmic probe WMAP, to compute
the gravitational-wave emission during neutrino oscillations in supernovae core
collapse and bounce. We show that the mass of the sterile neutrino $\nu_s$ that
can be resonantly produced during the flavor conversions makes it a good
candidate for dark matter as suggested by Fuller et {\it al.} (2003). The new
spacetime strain thus estimated is still several orders of magnitude larger
than those from $\nu$ difussion (convection and cooling) or quadrupole moments
of neutron star matter. This new feature turns these bursts the more promissing
supernova gravitational-wave signal that may be detected by observatories as

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we have investigated the relations between
the extinction $C({\rm H}\beta)$ as derived from the \Ha/\Hb emission line
ratio and various global parameters of the galaxies. Our main findings are
that: 1) $C({\rm H}\beta)$ is linked with the galaxy spectral type and colour,
decreasing from early- to late-type spirals. 2) $C({\rm H}\beta)$ increases
with increasing metallicity. 3) $C({\rm H}\beta)$ is larger in galaxies with an
older stellar population. 4) $C({\rm H}\beta)$ is larger for more luminous
galaxies. 5) The extinction of the stellar light is correlated with both the
extinction of the nebular light and the intrinsic galaxy colours. We propose
phenomenological interpretations of our empirical results. We have also
cross-correlated our sample of SDSS galaxies with the IRAS data base. Due to
the lower redshift limit imposed to our sample and to the detection limit of
IRAS, such a procedure selected only luminous infrared galaxies. We found that
correlations that were shown by other authors to occur between optical and
infrared properties of galaxies disappear when restricting the sample to
luminous infrared galaxies. We also found that the optical properties of the
luminous infrared galaxies in our SDSS sample are very similar to those of our
entire sample of SDSS galaxies. This may be explained by the IRAS luminosity of
the galaxies originating in the regions that formed massive stars less than 1
Myr ago, while the opacity of galaxies as derived from the \Ha/\Hb emission
line ratio is due to diffuse dust.
  We show some implications of our empirical results on the determination of
global star formation rates and total stellar masses in normal galaxies.

comparison with 362 spectroscopic redshifts shows that the achieved accuracy of
the photometric redshifts is (Delta z / (z_spec+1)) < 0.03 with only ~ 1 %
outliers. This allows us to derive luminosity functions with a reliability
similar to spectroscopic surveys. In addition, the luminosity functions can be
traced to objects of lower luminosity which generally are not accessible to
spectroscopy. We investigate the evolution of the luminosity functions
evaluated in the restframe UV (1500 Angstroem and 2800 Angstroem), u', B, and
g' bands. Comparison with results from the literature shows the reliability of
the derived luminosity functions. Out to redshifts of z ~ 2.5 the data are
consistent with a slope of the luminosity function approximately constant with
redshift, at a value of -1.07 +- 0.04 in the UV (1500 Angstroem, 2800

become shallower with increasing redshift but the effect is marginal. We find a

curves at moderate redshift from the FORS Deep Field (FDF) with simple models

framework, we keep a minimum number of constraints and we search a large volume
of parameter space, looking for the models which best reproduce the photometric
observations in the observed redshift range (0.5<z<1). We find the star
formation efficiency to correlate well with vMAX so that massive disks are more
efficient in the formation of stars and have a smaller spread in stellar ages.
This trend presents a break at around vMAX 140km/s. Galaxies on either side of
this threshold have significantly different age distributions. This break has
been already suggested by several authors in connection with the contribution
from either gravitational instabilities or supernova-driven turbulence to star
formation. No clear trend is seen between galaxy mass and infall timescale or
gas outflows. The model presented in this paper suggests massive disks have
formation histories resembling those of early-type galaxies, with highly
efficient and short-lived bursts, in contrast with low-mass disks, which have a
more extended star formation history. One option to explain the observed
shallow slope of the Tully-Fisher relation at intermediate redshift could be
small episodes of star formation in low-mass disks.

report on a set of new routines for the Xspec package for analysing X-ray
spectra of black-hole accretion disks. The new computational tool significantly
extends the capabilities of the currently available fitting procedures that
include the effects of strong gravity, and allows one to systematically explore
the constraints on more model parameters than previously possible (for example
black-hole angular momentum). Moreover, axial symmetry of the disk intrinsic
emissivity is not assumed, although it can be imposed to speed up the
computations. The new routines can be used also as a stand-alone and flexible
code with the capability of handling time-resolved spectra in the regime of
strong gravity. We have used the new code to analyse the mean X-ray spectrum
from the long XMM--Newton 2001 campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15.
Consistent with previous findings, we obtained a good fit to the broad Fe K
line profile for a radial line intrinsic emissivity law in the disk which is
not a simple power law, and for near maximal value of black hole angular
momentum. However, equally good fits can be obtained also for small values of
the black hole angular momentum. The code has been developed with the aim of
allowing precise modelling of relativistic effects. Although we find that
current data cannot constrain the parameters of black-hole/accretion disk
system well, the approach allows, for a given source or situation, detailed
investigations of what features of the data future studies should be focused on
in order to achieve the goal of uniquely isolating the parameters of such
systems.

the maximum white dwarf halo fraction compatible with this observation at
different significance levels if the halo is at least 14 gigayears old and

renormalization of the in-plane oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) which
appear upon doping in the HTSC's is discussed. It is shown that the
characteristic softening, indicating a strong EPI, is most likely a generic
effect of the CuO plane and is driven by a nonlocal coupling of the displaced
ions to the localized charge-fluctuations (CF's) at the Cu and O ions. The
different behaviour of the OBSM during the insulator-metal transition via the
underdoped phase is calculated and from a comparison of these modes conclusions
about the electronic state in the HTSC's are drawn. The underdoped state is
modelled in terms of a charge response which is insulator-like at the Cu and is
competing with a metallic charge response at the O-network in the CuO plane.
For the non-cuprate HTSC Ba-Bi-O also a strong renormalization of the OBSM is
predicted. C-axis polarized infrared and Raman-active modes of the HTSC's are
calculated in terms of CF's and anisotropic dipole-fluctuations and the problem
of a metallic character of the BiO planes is studied.Interlayer phonons and
their accompanying charge response are investigated. Depending on the
interlayer coupling calculations are performed from the static, adiabatic- to

long-ranged non-adiabatic EPI becomes evident within a certain region around

numerically for different nonlinear contributions to the Hamiltonian. In
agreement with the studies on the effective Hubbard Hamiltonian for boson
quasi-particles (see for instance Refs.\onlinecite{AGRANOVICH,Eilbeck}) a
pairing of the phonon states is found when the nonlinearity of the lattice is
significant. On the opposite, when the nonlinear contribution is weak or
moderate, which is common in materials the effective Hamiltonian is not
appropriate because it neglects all the energy terms that do not conserve the
boson number. Then for a realistic modelling of the hybridization between the
free phonon and the phonon bound pairs, the Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian is
required since it is derived from the potential energy of the atoms and thus it
does not involve any arbitrary quanta conservation. Actually, when the
nonlinearity is weak we prove that the binding energy of the phonon bound pairs
vanishes at the center of the lattice Brillouin zone whereas at the edge, it
may be comparable to the phonon band width.Consequently, the signature of a
weak nonlinearity is found to be a pseudogap that opens in the spectrum region
of the two phonon energy, at the edge of the lattice Brillouin zone. Our
results are shown to be valid for all the lattice dimensions and for some model
parameters that are relevant for the optical phonon spectra.

(metric-affine) formalisms. The nonlinear character of the gravity lagrangian
in the metric formalism causes the appearance of a scalar source of matter in
Einstein's equations that can be interpreted as a quintessence field. However,
in the Palatini case no new energy sources appear, though the equations of
motion get modified in such a way that usual matter can lead to repulsive
gravity at very low densities. Thus, the Palatini formalism could provide a
mechanism to explain the recent acceleration of the universe without the
necessity of dark energy sources. We also show that in contrast to the metric
formalism where only the Einstein frame should be considered as physical, the
Palatini formalism allows both the Einstein and the Jordan frames to be
physically acceptable.

given by a line integral taken along the unperturbed geodesic between two

time transfer functions giving the propagation time of a photon between its

time transfer functions, even if the metric is not stationary. We show how to
deduce these functions up to any given order in G from the perturbative

therefore transforms non-trivially under the boundary modular group. In

modular-invariant partition function of the dual CFT on the boundary. This is a
puzzle because AdS(3) string theory formally reduces to pure Chern-Simons
theory at long distances. We study this puzzle in the context of massive
Chern-Simons theory. We show that the puzzle is resolved in this context by the
appearance of a chiral ""spectator boson"" in the boundary CFT which restores
modular invariance. It couples to the conformal metric but not to the gauge
field on the boundary. Consequently, we find a generalization of the standard
Chern-Simons/RCFT correspondence involving ""nonholomorphic conformal blocks""
and nonrational boundary CFTs. These generalizations appear in the
long-distance limit of AdS(3) string theory, where the role of the spectator
boson is played by other degrees of freedom in the theory.

are discussed in detail. In this approach infinities cannot exist, the
cosmological constant problem does not arise and one irreducible representation
of the symmetry algebra necessarily describes a particle and its antiparticle
simultaneously. As a consequence, well known results of the standard theory
(spin-statistics theorem; a particle and its antiparticle have the same masses
and spins but opposite charges etc.) can be proved without involving local
covariant equations. The spin-statistics theorem is simply a requirement that
quantum theory should be based on complex numbers. Some new features of GFQT
are as follows: i) elementary particles cannot be neutral; ii) the Dirac vacuum
energy problem has a natural solution and the vacuum energy (which in the
standard theory is infinite and negative) equals zero as it should be; iii) the
charge operator has correct properties only for massless particles with the
spins 0 and 1/2. In the AdS version of the theory there exists a dilemma that
either the notion of particles and antiparticles is absolute and then only
particles with a half-integer spin can be elementary or the notion is valid
only when energies are not asymptotically large and then supersymmetry is

${\theta}_{eff}^2{\sim}2{\theta}^2(\frac{L}{2})^{2q-1}$ and thus it corresponds
to a strongly noncommuting space. In the quantum theory it turns out that this
prescription is also equivalent to a dimensional reduction of the model where
the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory in 4 dimensions is shown to be equivalent
in the large $L$ limit to an ordinary $O(M)$ non-linear sigma model in 2
dimensions where $M{\sim}3L^2$ . The Moyal-Weyl model defined this way is also
seen to be an ordinary renormalizable theory which can be solved exactly using
the method of steepest descents . More precisely we find for a fixed
renormalization scale $\mu$ and a fixed renormalized coupling constant $g_r^2$
an $O(M)-$symmetric mass, for the different components of the sigma field,
which is non-zero for all values of $g_r^2$ and hence the $O(M)$ symmetry is
never broken in this solution . We obtain also an exact representation of the
beta function of the theory which agrees with the known one-loop perturbative

the first order phase transition [1] when disorder is strong (i.e. the ratio v
of the binding energies is large; in DNA v is~1.1) and the Griffiths
singularity, i.e. infinite order transition, otherwise [2]. The problem is
important, since many physical phenomena map onto the same model (see refs. in

Unfortunately, both titles are misleading: they claim the results which are
proven for homopolymers only.

theory predicts these modifications can increase the growth rate of the tearing
instability by almost two orders of magnitude and shift the fastest growing
modes to significantly shorter wavelengths. These predictions are confirmed by
nonlinear kinetic simulations in which the growth and coalescence of small
scale magnetic islands leads to a rapid onset of large scale reconnection.

demonstrated that in the parallel-plate amplification mode one can reach both
high gains (>100000) and good position resolutions (~100 micro meter) even with
a single step arrangement. It offers a compact amplification structure, which
can be used in many applications. For example, in preliminary tests we
succeeded to combine it with a photocathode and use it as a position sensitive
gaseous photomultiplier. CsI coated capillary plates could also be used as a
high position resolution and high rate X-ray converter.

recombination) from the standpoint of whether the induced evolutionary dynamics
have a ""fast-slow"" time scale associated with the differences in relaxation
time between local quasi-equilibria and the global equilibrium. This dynamical
behavior has been formally described in the econometrics literature in terms of
the spectral properties of the appropriate operator matrices by Simon and Ando
(1961), and we use the relations they derive to ask which fitness functions and
mutation/recombination operators satisfy these properties. It turns out that
quite a wide range of landscapes satisfy the condition (at least trivially)
under point mutation given a sufficiently low mutation rate, while the property
appears to be difficult to satisfy under genetic recombination. In spite of the
fact that Simon-Ando decomposability can be realized over fairly wide range of
parameters, it imposes a number of restrictions on which landscape
partitionings are possible. For these reasons, the Simon-Ando formalism doesn't
appear to be applicable to other forms of decomposition and aggregation of
variables that are important in evolutionary systems.

propose a method for distinguishing Bell-basis vectors, each of which consists
of a pair of an electron and a positron, by this gate. (This is called the
Bell-basis measurement.) This method succeeds with probability 1 in the limit
of $N \to \infty$, where N is the number of beam splitters in the
interferometer. Moreover, we can carry out a controlled-NOT gate operation by
the above Bell-basis measurement and the method proposed by Gottesman and
Chuang. Therefore, we can prepare a universal set of quantum gates by the IFM.
This means that we can execute any quantum algorithm by the IFM.
