high-resolution analysis does not require extinction estimates. Moroever, it
yields T_eff and gravities independent of theoretical evolutionary models. We
find that our gravities for most of the sample agree remarkably well with the
isochrone predictions for the likely cluster ages. However, discrepancies
appear in our coolest targets: these appear to have significantly lower gravity
(by up to 0.75 dex) than our hotter objects, even though our entire sample
covers a relatively narrow range in T_eff (about 300K). This drop in gravity is
also implied by inter-comparisons of the data alone, without recourse to
synthetic spectra. We consider, and argue against, dust opacity, cool stellar
spots or metallicity differences leading to the observed spectral effects; a
real decline in gravity is strongly indicated. Such gravity variations are
contrary to the predictions of the evolutionary tracks, causing improbably low
ages to be inferred from the tracks for our coolest targets. We venture that
these results may arise from evolutionary model uncertainties related to
accretion, deuterium-burning and/or convection effects. Finally, when combined
with photometry and distances, our technique for deriving gravities and
temperatures provides a way of obtaining masses and radii for substellar
objects independent of evolutionary models, as presented in Paper II.

our derived mass-radius and mass-luminosity relationships are in very good
agreement with the theoretical predictions. However, our results diverge from
the evolutionary model values for the coolest, lowest-mass targets: our
inferred radii and luminosities are significantly larger than predicted for
these objects at the likely cluster ages, causing them to appear much younger

in the choice of initial conditions and/or treatment of interior convection -
may be responsible for this discrepancy. Finally, two of our late-M objects
(USco 128 and 130) appear to have masses close to the deuterium-fusion boundary
(9--14 Jupiters, within a factor of 2). This conclusion is primarily a
consequence of their considerable faintness compared to other targets with
similar extinction, spectral type and temperature (difference of 1 mag). Our
result suggests that the faintest young late-M or cooler objects may be
significantly lower in mass than the current theoretical tracks indicate.

Chandra} X-ray observatory. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by a power-law
whose index varies across the nebula. The variation can be discussed in terms
of the particle injection from the pulsar in two different directions: the
equatorial plane containing the torus and the symmetry axis along the jet. In
the equatorial plane, spectra within the torus are the hardest, with photon
index $\alpha \approx 1.9$, and are almost independent of the surface
brightness. At the periphery of the torus, the spectrum gradually softens in
the outer, lower surface brightness regions, up to $\alpha \approx 3.0$. This
indicates that synchrotron losses become significant to X-ray emitting
particles at the outer boundary of the torus. We discuss the nature of the
torus, incorporating information from observations at other wavelengths.
Spectral variations are also seen within the southern jet. The core of the jet
is the hardest with $\alpha \approx$ 2.0, and the outer sheath surrounding the
core becomes softer with $\alpha$ up to 2.5 at the outermost part. Based on the
similarity between the spectra of the jet core and the torus, we suggest that
the electron spectra of the particles injected from the pulsar are also similar
in these two different directions. The brightness ratio between the near and
far sides of the torus can be explained by Doppler boosting and relativistic
aberration; however, the observed ratio cannot be derived from the standard
weakly magnetized pulsar wind model. We also found a site where an optical
filament comprised of supernova ejecta is absorbing the soft X-ray emission
($<$ 2 keV).

spectra of the classical nova V1974 Cyg 1992. In addition to the P Cygni and
emission lines, two shortward shifted absorption systems are present. Evidence
is given that these absorptions originate in two separate expanding shells,
outside the wind layers where the emission lines are formed. The outer main
shell, containing most of the matter ejected at outburst, produces the
so-called ``principal absorption line system'', and the inner faster moving
second shell produces the so-called ``diffuse--enhanced absorption line
system''. The outflow velocity of the two shells increases exponentially with
time reaching a value of about 1750 km/s and 2900 km/s, respectively. We
suggest that the acceleration of the shells is the result of increasing
line-radiation pressure due to the UV-brightening of the star as the effective
radius decreases. Around day 60 the second shell has overtaken the slower
moving principal system shell, and merged with it. This explains: the sudden
disappearance of the diffuse line system near that date, the upward jump of 240
km/s in velocity of the principal system and the first detection of hard X-ray
emission on day 63. This velocity jump indicates that the main shell is about 4
times more massive than the second shell. The deceleration suffered by the
diffuse-enhanced system after the shock provides a shock temperature of about
1.6 KeV, in fairly good agreement with the temperature of the observed hard
X-ray emission.

virilized in BLRs. It is found that the sizes of the BLRs in these sources are
usually 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than that expected by the empirical
correlation between BLR size and optical luminosity defined by a sample of
Seyfert galaxies and quasars. We discuss a variety of possibilities and suggest
it may probably be attributed to anisotropic motion of the BLR clouds in these
BL Lac objects. If the BLR geometry of these sources is disk-like, the viewing
angles between the axis and the line of sight are in the range of 2-12 degrees,
which is consistent with the unification schemes.

pions, with a characteristic spectrum symmetric about m_{pi^0}/2. We exploit
the well-defined properties of the pion decay spectrum to quantify the maximum
pionic fraction of the observed gamma-ray intensity. We find that the Galactic
spectrum above 30 MeV can be at most about 50% pionic. The maximum pionic
contribution to the extragalactic spectrum is energy dependent; it also depends
on the redshift range over which the sources are distributed, ranging from as
low as about 20% for pions generated very recently, to as much as 90% if the
pions are generated around redshift 10. The implications of these constraints
for models of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are briefly discussed.

- \frac{A}{{\rho}^{\alpha}}$ was recently proposed as a candidate for dark
energy in the Universe. In this paper we confront the GCG with SNIa data.
Specifically we have tested the GCG cosmology in three different classes of
models with (1) $\Omega_m= 0.3$, $\Omega_{Ch}= 0.7$; (2) $\Omega_m= 0.05$,
$\Omega_{Ch}= 0.95$ and (3) $\Omega_m = 0$, $\Omega_{Ch} = 1$, as well as the
model withouth any assumption on $\Omega_m$. The best fitted models are
obtained by minimalizing the $\chi^2$ function and $\chi^2$ levels in the
$(A_0, \alpha)$ plane. We supplemented our analysis with confidence intervals
in the $(A_0, \alpha)$ plane, as well as one-dimensional probability
distribution functions for models parameter. The general conclusion is that
SNIa data strongly support the Chaplygin gas (with $\alpha = 1$). Extending our
analysisby relaxing the flat prior lead to the result that even though the best
fitted values of $\Omega_k$ are formally non-zero, still they are close to flat
case. It should be viewed as an advantage of the GCG model since in similar
analysisof $\Lambda$CDM model high negative value of $\Omega_{k}$ were found to
be bestfitted to the data and independent inspiration from CMBR and
extragalactic astronomy has been invoked to fix the curvature problem. Our
results show clearly that in Generalized Chaplygin Gas cosmology distant $z >1$
supernovae should be brighter than in $\Lambda$CDM model.This prediction seems
to be confirmed with new Riess high redshift SNIa sample. Moreover, we argue
that with the future SNAP data it would be possible to differentiate between
models with various value of $\alpha$ parameter and/or discriminated between
GCG, Cardassian and $\Lambda$CDM models

semi- detached compact binary systems. The analytical model that describes the
onset of these cycles, which occur on a thermal timescale of the donor star, is
reexamined. We take into account a contribution of the thermal relaxation which
is not related to the irradiation of the donor star and which was neglected in
previous studies. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) containing extended giant donors
are more stable than previously thought. CVs close to the upper edge of the
period gap can undergo cycles for low angular momentum loss rates, as they have
been suggested by recent magnetic braking prescriptions, while they are stable
for high braking rates. A model for the irradiation geometry that takes into
account surface elements near the terminator of the donor star indicates that
possibly also low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can undergo mass transfer cycles.
Regarding the braking rate, which is necessary to drive cycles, basically the
same restrictions apply for short period LMXBs as they do for short period CVs.
We confirm that LMXBs containing giants can undergo cyles. In terms of an
irradiation efficiency parameter \alpha CVs are susceptible to the irradiation
instability for \alpha >= 0.1 while LMXBs are susceptible for \alpha <= 0.1.
The predictions of the analytical model are checked by the first long-term
evolutionary computations of systems undergoing mass transfer cycles with full
1D stellar models. For unevolved main sequence (MS) and giant donors the
analytic model provides reasonable values for the boundaries of the stable and
unstable regions while CVs containing highly evolved MS donors are more stable
at high braking rates than expected.Taking into account irradiation the minimum
period of CVs is increased by up to 1-2 minutes, depending on \alpha.

polarized intensity and a starlight polarization map to model polarization
angles. The basic template is obtained directly at 23 GHz with about 94%
sky--coverage by using the synchrotron map released by the WMAP team.
Extrapolations to 32, 60 and 90 GHz are performed by computing a synchrotron
spectral index map, which strongly reduces previous uncertainties in passing
from low (1.4 GHz) to microwave frequencies. Differing from low frequency data,
none of our templates presents relevant structures out of the Galactic Plane.
Our map at 90 GHz suggests that the synchrotron emission at high Galactic
latitudes is low enough to allow a robust detection of the $E$--mode component
of the cosmological signal on large--scale, even in models with
low--reionization ($\tau = 0.05$). Detection of the weaker $B$--mode on the

The inhomogeneity of the ordered moment sizes is characterized by the muSR time

dopant S=0 sites with a recovery length of \xi = 150-200 sites. The origin of

compared to the estimate based on the effective staggered magnetic field from
the neighboring chains.

translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in

being based on updating a matrix product state in time, it is very accessible

importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG

situations where Planck-scale physics and the notion of a quantum spacetime are
relevant, field propagation will be described by a modified set of laws.
Descriptions of the underlying mechanism differ from model to model, but a
general feature is that electromagnetic waves will have non-trivial dispersion
relations. A physical phenomenon that offers the possibility of experimentally
testing these ideas in the foreseeable future is the propagation of high-energy
gamma rays from GRB's at cosmological distances. With the observation of
non-standard dispersion relations within experimental reach, it is thus
important to find out whether there are competing effects that could either
mask or be mistaken for this one. In this letter, we consider possible effects
from standard physics, due to electromagnetic interactions, classical as well
as quantum, and coupling to classical geometry. Our results indicate that, for
currently observed gamma-ray energies and estimates of cosmological parameter
values, those effects are much smaller than the quantum gravity one if the
latter is first-order in the energy; some corrections are comparable in
magnitude with the second-order quantum gravity ones, but they have a very
different energy dependence.

three points of view: geometrodynamics, Lagrange-Euler field theory, and gauge
field theory. From a geometrodynamics perspective, a definition of the
reference frame as a differential manifold with an affine connection results in
separation of the respective contributions of inertial and gravitational fields
represented by the affine connection and the tensor of nonmetricity within the
Levi-Civita connection of GR. Resulting decomposition of the Einstein curvature
tensor into affine and nonmetric parts allows to recast Einstein's field
equations in a form invariant with respect to the choice of a reference frame
wherein the gravity is described by nonmetricity of space-time . A covariant
Lagrangian is proposed leading to the same field equation. All three approaches
ultimately lead to the same fully covariant theory of gravitation with a
covariant tensor of energy-momentum of the gravitational field and differential
and integral conservation laws. The role of the frames of reference, as
distinguished from coordinate systems, is discussed.

detected by the Extreme Universe Space Observatory (EUSO). The analysis
exploits a recently proposed technique that differentiates ultra-high energy
neutralinos from ultra-high energy neutrinos using their different absorption
lengths in the Earth's crust. It is shown that for a significant part of the
parameter space, where the neutralino is mostly a Bino and with squark mass
$\sim 1$ TeV, EUSO could see ultra-high energy neutralino events with
essentially no background. In the energy range 10^9 GeV < E < 10^11 GeV, the
unprecedented aperture of EUSO makes the telescope sensitive to neutralino
fluxes as low as 1.1 \times 10^{-6} (E/GeV)^{-1.3} GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} yr^{-1}
sr^{-1}, at the 95% CL. Such a hard spectrum is characteristic of supermassive
particles' $N$-body hadronic decay. The case in which the flux of ultra-high
energy neutralinos is produced via decay of metastable heavy particles with
uniform distribution throughout the universe is analyzed in detail. The
normalization of the ratio of the relics' density to their lifetime has been
fixed so that the baryon flux produced in the supermassive particle decays
contributes to about 1/3 of the events reported by the AGASA Collaboration
below 10^{11} GeV, and hence the associated GeV gamma-ray flux is in complete
agreement with EGRET data. For this particular case, EUSO will collect between
4 and 5 neutralino events (with 0.3 of background) in ~ 3 yr of running. NASA's

condensate, revisiting stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). Due to
collisional mean-field shifts, efficient molecular conversion requires strong
coupling and low density, either of which can bring about rogue
photodissociation to noncondensate modes. We demonstrate explicitly that rogue
transitions are negligible for low excited-state fractions and
photodissociation that is slower than the STIRAP timescale. Moreover, we derive
a reduced-parameter model of collisions, and thereby find that a gain in the
molecular conversion efficiency can be obtained by adjusting the atom-atom
scattering length with off-resonant magnetoassociation. This gain saturates
when the atom-atom scattering length is tuned to a specific fraction of either
the molecule-molecule or atom-molecule scattering length. We conclude that a
fully-optimized STIRAP scheme may offer the best chance for achieving coherent
conversion from an atomic to a molecular condensate with photoassociation.

showing the tendency for the tails to resemble more and more a power law for

density and axonal competition for space. Therefore, we show how apparent
repulsive interaction can be induced by a combination of attraction to the
target and competitive interactions between axons. We suggest an experimental
test that may distinguish repulsive interaction with the target from repulsion
