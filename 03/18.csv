epochs, spanning a time of ~1 year, 12 distinct maser features have been
detected, 7 out of these detected in more than one epoch. The positions and the
velocities of the VLBI features agree well with those of the emission centers
previously identified by means of VLA observations. For a few features,
persistent over three or four epochs, accurate values of the proper motions are
derived. On the basis of their spatial distribution, the observed maser
features can be divided into two groups. A model fit to the positions and
velocities of the maser features of Group I, detected in the same region
(within ~500 mas) where the massive YSO should be located, demonstrates that
these might arise on the surface of a nearly edge-on Keplerian disk, rotating
around a massive young stellar object. The maser features of Group II, found at
large distances from the YSO (> 1 arcsec), have positions and line-of-sight
velocities in agreement with the blue-shifted lobe of a large scale molecular
outflow (traced by the HCO+ and SiO emission), and might result from the
interaction between the gas flowing away from the young stellar object and the
ambient gas of the progenitor molecular core.

quantitative estimate of the population ratios (by number and luminosity)

and discussed in the framework of probing the so-called Red Giant Branch phase
transition (RGB Ph-T). By using the Elson & Fall s-parameter as an age
indicator, the observed RGB population shows a sharp enhancement (both in
number and luminosity) at s=36. Obviously, the corresponding absolute age
strictly depends on the details of theoretical models adopted to calibrate the
s-parameter. Curiously, the currently available calibrations of the s-parameter
in term of age based on canonical (by Elson & Fall 1988) and overshooting
(Girardi et al. 1995) models provide ages that well agree within 10%,
suggesting that the full development of the Red Giant Branch occurs at t=700
Myr and be a relatively fast event (delta t=300 Myr). However, the RGB Ph-T
epoch derived from the overshooting calibration of the s-parameter turns out to
be significantly earlier than the epoch provided by the recent evolutionary
tracks by Girardi et al. (2000). A new calibration of the s-parameter based on
high quality Color Magnitude Diagrams and updated models is urged to address
the origin of this discrepancy and finally establish the epoch of the RGB Ph-T.

  for the density profile are replaced. The figures for the case with a large
  number of particles are added",,,,"astro-ph cond-mat.stat-mech physics.comp-ph",,"  We propose two hypotheses which characterize the quasi-equilibrium state that
realizes after a cold collapse of self-gravitating system. The first hypothesis
is the linear temperature-mass (TM) relation, which yields a characteristic
non-Gaussian velocity distribution. The second is the local virial (LV)
relation, which, combining the linear TM relation, determines a unique mass
density profile as $\rho(r)={\rho}%_{0}r^{-4}e^{-r_0/r}$. Although this density
profile is unphysical in the central region, the region is just inner a few
percent around the center of a bound region in cumulative mass, which is beyond
the resolution of our numerical simulations. Hence posing two hypotheses is
compatible to the numerical simulations for almost the whole region of the
virialized bound state. Actually, except for this inner part, this density
profile fits well to the data of cold collapse simulations. Two families of
spherical and isotropic models, polytropes and King models, are examined from a
view point of these two hypotheses. We found that the LV relation imposes a
strong constraint on these models: only polytropes with index $n \sim 5$ such
as Plummer's model are compatible with the numerical results characterized by
the two hypotheses among these models. King models with the concentration
parameter $% c \sim 2$ violate the LV relation while they are consistent with
the $R^{1/4} $ law for the surface brightness. Hence the above characteristics
can serve as a guideline to build up the models for the bound state after a
cold collapse, besides the conventional criteria concerning the asymptotic
behavior.

late-type galaxies have been considered as intermediate-mass black hole
candidates. We have performed Monte-Carlo simulations of Comptonized
multi-color black-body accretion disks. This unified and self-consistent
spectral model assumes a spherically symmetric, thermal corona around each disk
and accounts for the radiation transfer in the Comptonization. We find that the
model provides satisfactory fits to the XMM-Newton spectra of thesources. The
characteristic temperatures of the accretion disks (T_in), for example, are in
the range of ~ 0.05-0.3 keV, consistent with the intermediate-mass black hole
interpretation. We find that the black hole mass is typically about a few times
10^3 M_\odot and has an accretion rate ~ 10^{-6} - 10^{-5} M_\odot yr^{-1}. For
the spectra considered here, we find that the commonly used multi-color
black-body accretion disk model with an additive power law component, though

stars in the compact star forming region SMC-N81. Non-LTE spherically extended
atmosphere models including line-blanketing have been computed with the code
CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) and the analysis of UV STIS spectra lead to the
following results: 1) The SMC-N81 components are young (~ 0-4 Myrs) O stars
with Teff compatible with medium to late subtypes and with luminosities lower
than average Galactic O dwarfs, rendering them possible ZAMS candidates; 2) The
winds are extremely weak: the mass loss rates (~1e-8/1e-9 Msol/yr) and the
modified wind momenta are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than observed so far
for Galactic stars, and are lower than the predictions of the most recent
hydrodynamical models. The reasons for such weak winds are investigated with
special emphasis on the modified wind momenta: 1) There may be a break-down of
the wind momentum - luminosity relation (WLR) for dwarf stars at low luminosity
(log L/Lsol < 5.5). However, reasons for such a breakdown remain unknown; 2)
The slope of the WLR may be steeper at low metallicity. This is predicted by
the radiation driven wind theory, but the current hydrodynamical simulations do
not show any change of the slope at SMC metallicity. Moreover, there are
indications that some Galactic objects have wind momenta similar to those of
the SMC stars; 3) Decoupling in the atmosphere may lead to multicomponent
winds, but various tests indicate that this is not likely to be the case for
the SMC-N81 stars. Hence, the origin of the weakness of the wind observed in
these objects remains unknown. We suggest that this weakness may be linked with
the youth of these stars and represents possibly the onset of stellar winds in
recently formed massive stars.

magnetic fields for early-type stars, for which it is sensitive to field
strengths in the 1-300 G range. In this paper we compute the polarized P-Cygni
line profiles that result from the Hanle effect. For modeling the polarization,
we employ a variant of the ``last scattering approximation''. For cases in
which the Sobolev optical depths are greater than unity, the emergent line
intensity is assumed to be unpolarized; while for smaller optical depths, the
Stokes source functions for the Hanle effect with optically thin line
scattering are used. For a typical P Cygni line, the polarized emission forms
in the outer wind, because the Sobolev optical depth is large at the inner
wind. For low surface field strengths, weak P Cygni lines are needed to measure
the circumstellar field. For high values of the surface fields, both the Zeeman
and Hanle diagnostics can be used, with the Zeeman effect probing the
photospheric magnetic fields, and the Hanle effect measuring the magnetic field
in the wind flow. Polarized line profiles are calculated for a self-consistent
structure of the flow and the magnetic geometry based on the WCFields model,
which is applicable to slowly rotating stellar winds with magnetic fields drawn
out by the gas flow. For surface fields of a few hundred Gauss, we find that
the Hanle effect can produce line polarizations in the range of a few tenths of
a percent up to about 2 percent.

alpha emission line that is consistent with being surprisingly symmetric, even
given the relatively poor quality of its spectrum. The blue wing of a Lyman
alpha line originating at high redshift should be strongly suppressed by
resonant hydrogen absorption along the line of sight, an expectation borne out
by the observed asymmetric shapes of the existing sample of Lyman alpha
emitting sources at lower redshifts (3< z < 6.7). Absorption on the blue side
of the line of the Pello et al. source could be reduced if the intergalactic
medium (IGM) in the vicinity of the galaxy is highly ionized, but we show that
this requires an unrealistically high ionizing emissivity. We suggest instead
that the Lyman alpha emitting gas be receding relative to the surrounding gas
with a velocity of >= 35km/s, a large velocity that is plausible only if the
galaxy is part of a larger system (group of galaxies) with a velocity
dispersion >= 35km/s. We find that with this velocity shift, the observed
strength and shape of the line is still consistent with the galaxy being
surrounded by its own Stromgren sphere embedded in a fully neutral IGM. More
generally, we predict that at any given redshift, the bright Lyman alpha
emitters with broader lines would exhibit stronger asymmetry than fainter ones.
Bright galaxies with symmetric Lyman alpha lines may be signposts for groups

comparable to or larger than their linewidths.

method for measuring the variability of bursts because of their transient and
aperiodic nature. We define a simple statistic: the ratio of the integrated
structure function from 0.1 to 1 s compared to that from 0.1 to 10 s, as
measured in the observer frame. To avoid instrumental effects we restrict our
analysis to GRBs with BATSE data. Comparing 10 A-GRBs to a ``main'' sample of
about 500 bursts, we find there is a probability of only 0.03 of the samples
being drawn from the same population, with the A-GRBs tending to have
relatively less power on sub-second timescales. We conclude that this result is
tentative evidence for variations in the properties of GRB progenitors that
affect both the gamma-ray and afterglow properties of long-duration GRBs. In
addition, our method of analyzing variability identifies a characteristic
timescale of ~1 s, below which variability is suppressed, and finds a trend of
increased short timescale variability at higher gamma-ray energies. The
long-duration GRBs that we identify as having the most sub-second timescale
variability, may be relatively bright examples of short-duration GRBs.

hole (MBH), which is based on the accumulation there of a very dense cluster of
compact stellar remnants. This study is motivated by the presence of ~10 young
massive stars (M*~3-15 Mo, ~B9V--O8V) less than 0.04 pc from the MBH in the
Galactic center (GC). Their existence in the extreme environment so close to a
MBH is a challenge for theories of star formation and stellar dynamics. We show
that young stars, which formed far from the MBH and were then scattered into
eccentric orbits, repeatedly cross a cluster of stellar black holes (SBHs),
where they may undergo rare direct 3-body exchanges with a MBH-SBH ""binary"".
The interaction between two objects of similar mass ejects the SBH and captures
the star on a tight orbit around the MBH. Such captures can naturally explain
trends observed in the orbits of the young stars. We derive the capture
cross-section, validate it by Monte-Carlo simulations, and calculate the number
of captured stars in the GC using the currently uncertain estimates of the
numbers of SBHs inside 0.04 pc and of young stars in the inner few pc of the
GC. We find that under favorable conditions 3-body exchange can account for
\~25% of the observed stars, mostly at the fainter end of the observed range.
We discuss additional effects that possibly increase the capture efficiency.
Future observations will establish whether there are enough SBHs and young
stars for exchange captures to singly account for the central young stars. We
estimate that there are also ~35 lower mass stars (M*~1-3 Mo, ~G2V--A0V) inside
0.04 pc similarly captured by exchanges with neutron stars. Ongoing replacement
of compact remnants by main sequence stars may regulate the accumulation of
compact remnants near the MBH.

the temperature distribution in neutron star crusts. We consider axisymmetric
dipolar fields which are either restricted to the stellar crust, ``crustal
fields'', or allowed to penetrate the core, ``core fields''. By integrating the
two-dimensional heat transport equation in the crust, taking into account the
classical (Larmor) anisotropy of the heat conductivity, we obtain the crustal
temperature distribution, assuming an isothermal core. Including quantum
magnetic field effects in the envelope as a boundary condition, we deduce the
corresponding surface temperature distributions. We find that core fields
result in practically isothermal crusts unless the surface field strength is
well above $10^{15}$ G while for crustal fields with surface strength above a
few times $10^{12}$ G significant deviations from isothermality occur at core
temperatures inferior or equal to $10^8$ K. At the stellar surface, the cold
equatorial region produced by the quantum suppression of heat transport
perpendicular to the field in the envelope, present for both core and crustal
fields, is significantly extended by the classical suppression at higher
densities in the case of crustal fields. This can result, for crustal fields,
in two small warm polar regions which will have observational consequences: the
neutron star has a small effective thermally emitting area and the X-ray pulse
profiles are expected to have a distinctively different shape compared to the
case of a neutron star with a core field. These features, when compared with
X-ray data on thermal emission of young cooling neutron stars, will open a way
to provide observational evidence in favor, or against, the two radically
different configurations of crustal or core magnetic fields.

ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) regime. The X-ray lightcurve exhibits a
variety of features including a significant upward drift over the 60 ks
observation. Most notably a series of X-ray dips are apparent with individual
dips lasting for typically 100-300 s. Some of these dips reach almost 100
percent diminution of the source flux in the 2.0-4.5 keV band. The EPIC CCD
spectra can be modelled with two spectral components, a very soft powerlaw
continuum (Gamma ~ 4) dominant below 2 keV, plus a multi-colour disc (MCD)
component with an inner-disc temperature kT ~ 0.8 keV. The observed upperward
drift in the X-ray flux can be attributed to an increase in the level of the
MCD component, whilst the normalisation of the powerlaw continuum remains
unchanged. The dipping episodes correspond to a loss of signal from both
spectral components, although the blocking factor is at least a factor two
higher for the MCD component. XMMU J001528.9-391319 can be considered as a
candidate black-hole binary (BHB) system. A plausible explanation of the
observed temporal and spectral behaviour is that we view the accretion disc
close to edge-on and that, during dips, orbiting clumps of obscuring material
enter our line of sight and cause significant blocking or scattering of the
hard thermal X-rays emitted from the inner disc. In contrast, the more extended
source of the soft powerlaw flux is only partially covered by the obscuring

of general relativity modified by an additional time-homogeneous Weylian length
connection lead to beautiful cosmological models (Weyl universes) . The
magnitude-redshift relation of recent supernovae Ia measurements is in perfect
agreement with the prediction of decrease of energy flux in the Weyl models.
These data allow to estimate the (ex-ante) spacelike curvature of Weyl
universes. Quasar frequency data from the SDSS provide strong evidence of a
positive ex-ante curvature. Thus an Einstein-Weyl universe, i.e., an Einstein
universe endowed with a Weylian length connection, is in good agreement with
supernovae and quasar data.
  The relative mass-energy density with respect to the critical density of the
standard approach, and the relative contribution of the ``vacuum term'' are
time-independent in Weyl gauge. Thus the time-evolution anomaly of vacuum
energy does not arise. The intervals given in the literature for the
dynamically determined matter density parameter are consistent with other data
in the Weyl geometric approach. An explanation of the cosmic microwave
background by a maximal entropy state of the quantized Maxwell equation,
according to a proposal by I.E. Segal for the conformal Einstein universe,
translates directly to the Weyl approach. It leads to quantitative estimations
for the temperature of the Planck radiation between 2 and 5.3 deg K. Moreover,
the anisotropy angles, expected to arise in an Einstein-Weyl universe agrees
with the results of multipole measurements of CMB anisotropies.

The excellent light-curve coverage has allowed us to detect and classify CNe
over a wide range of speed class, from very fast to very slow. Among the
light-curves is a moderately fast CN exhibiting entry into a deep transition
minimum, followed by its final decline. We have also observed in detail a very
slow CN which faded by only 0.01 mag day$^{-1}$ over a 150 day period. We
detect other interesting variable objects, including one of the longest period

well-sampled and objectively-selected data set with which to study the
statistical properties of classical novae in M31, such as the global nova rate,
the reliability of novae as standard-candle distance indicators and the

interactions, as e.g. quasistatic fiber bundles. The system starts intact with
a surface-energy threshold required to break any cell sampled from an
uncorrelated quenched-disorder distribution. The evolution of this
heterogeneous system is ruled by Griffith's principle which states that a cell
breaks when the release in elastic energy in the system exceeds the
surface-energy barrier necessary to break the cell. By direct integration over
all possible realizations of the quenched disorder, we obtain the probability
distribution of each damage configuration at any level of the imposed external
deformation. We demonstrate an isomorphism between the distributions so
obtained and standard generalized Ising models, in which the coupling constants
and effective temperature in the Ising model are functions of the nature of the
quenched-disorder distribution and the extent of accumulated damage. In
particular, we show that damage models with global load sharing are isomorphic
to standard percolation theory, that damage models with local load sharing rule
are isomorphic to the standard Ising model, and draw consequences thereof for
the universality class and behavior of the autocorrelation length of the
breakdown transitions corresponding to these models. We also treat damage
models having more general power-law interactions, and classify the breakdown
process as a function of the power-law interaction exponent. Last, we also show
that the probability distribution over configurations is a maximum of Shannon's
entropy under some specific constraints related to the energetic balance of the
fracture process, which firmly relates this type of quenched-disorder based
damage model to standard statistical mechanics.

layers, in smectic phases; between columns, in columnar phases-- are
commonplace in liquid crystals. The resulting deformed textures have the same
mass density as in the ground state (an expected property in a liquid) and are
at the same time isogonic and isometric, which imposes specific geometric
features. The corresponding order parameter singularities extend over rather
large, macroscopic, distances, e.g., cofocal conics in smectics. This
well-known picture is modified when, superimposed to the 1D or 2D
periodicities, the structure is helical. Isogony is no longer the rule, but
isometry (and mass density) can be preserved. This paper discusses the case of
a medium whose structure is made of 1D modulated layers (a lamello-columnar
phase), assuming that the modulations rotate helically from one layer to the
next. The price to pay is that any isometric texture is necessarily frustrated;
it consists of layers folded into a set of parallel helicoids, in the manner of
a screw dislocation (of macroscopic Burgers vector), the modulations being
along the helices, i.e. double-twisted. The singularity set is made of two
helical disclination lines. We complete this geometric analysis by a crude
calculation of the energy of a helical ribbon. It is suggested that the helical
ribbons observed in the B7 phase of banana-like molecules are such isometric
textures. As a side result, let us mention that the description of
double-twist, traditionally made in terms of a partition of the director field
into nested cylinders, could more than often be profitably tested against a
partition into nested helicoids.

non-interacting case, we analyze the frequency dispersion of the third cumulant
of the current operator ${\cal S}_3$ at frequencies well below both the inverse
charge relaxation time and the inverse electron dwell time. This dispersion
turns out to be important in the frequency range comparable to applied
voltages. For comparatively transparent conductors it may lead to the sign
change of ${\cal S}_3$. We also analyze the behavior of the second cumulant of
the current operator ${\cal S}_2$ (current noise) in the presence of
electron-electron interactions. In a wide range of parameters we obtain
explicit universal dependencies of ${\cal S}_2$ on temperature, voltage and
frequency. We demonstrate that Coulomb interaction decreases the Nyquist noise.
In this case the interaction correction to the noise spectrum is governed by
the combination $\sum_nT_n(T_n-1)$, where $T_n$ is the transmission of the
$n$-th conducting mode. The effect of electron-electron interactions on the
shot noise is more complicated. At sufficiently large voltages we recover two
different interaction corrections entering with opposite signs. The net result
is proportional to $\sum_nT_n(T_n-1)(1-2T_n)$, i.e. Coulomb interaction

magnetic field. Geometric-like magnetic-fields determined by the Berry's phase
appear within the quantum description. The application of a variational
procedure on the original quantum equation leads to a set of dynamical
evolution equations for the quantum average value of the position operator and
of the spin variables. Within this approximation we derive the
quantum-mechanical ground state configuration matching the classical adiabatic
solution and perform some numerical simulations.

of a particle to a singularly attracting center, basing on a black-hole concept
of the latter.
  The singularity r^{-2} in the potential of the radial Schroedinger equation
is considered as an emitting/absorbing center. The two solutions oscillating in
the origin are treated as asymptotically free particles, which implies that the
singular point r=0 in the Schroedinger equation is treated on the same physical
ground as the singular point r=infinity. To make this interpretation possible,
it is needed that the norm squared of the wave function should diverge when r
tends to zero, in other words, the measure used in definition of scalar
products should be singular in the origin. Such measure comes into play if the
Schroedinger equation is written in the form of the generalized (Kamke)
eigenvalue problem for either of two - chosen differently depending on the sign
of the energy E - operators, other than Hamiltonian. The Hilbert spaces where
these two operators act are used to classify physical states, which are: i)
states of ""confinement""- continuum of solutions localized near the origin, E<0
- and ii) the states corresponding to the inelastic process of
reflection/transmission, i.e. to transitions in-between states localized near
the origin and in the infinitely remote region, E>0. The corresponding unitary
2x2 S-matrix is written in terms of the Jost functions. The complete
orthonormal sets of eigen-solutions of the two operators are found using
""quantization in a box"" (a,b), followed by the transition to the limit a=0,

between mutually tangent circles with further tangent circles. In Euclidean
space it is possible for every circle in such a packing to have integer radius
of curvature, and we call such a packing an integral Apollonian circle packing.
There are infinitely many different integral packings; these were studied in
the paper \cite{GLMWY21}. Integral circle packings also exist in spherical and
hyperbolic space, provided a suitable definition of curvature is used (see
\cite{LMW02}) and again there are an infinite number of different integral
packings. This paper studies number-theoretic properties of such packings. This
amounts to studying the orbits of a particular subgroup $\sA$ of the group of
integral automorphs of the indefinite quaternary quadratic form $Q_{\sD}(w, x,
y, z)= 2(w^2+x^2 +y^2 + z^2) - (w+x+y+z)^2$. This subgroup, called the

gives a reduction theory for orbits of $\sA$ acting on integer solutions to

for all $k \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$ in terms of an extra parameter $n$ and an

media disperse and attenuate waves. This dissipative behavior can be taken into
account by using a viscoacoustic propagation model, which incorporates a
complex and frequency-dependent viscoacoustic modulus in the constitutive
relation. The main difficulty then lies in finding an efficient way to
discretize the constitutive equation as it becomes a convolution integral in
the time domain. To overcome this difficulty the usual approach consists in
approximating the viscoacoustic modulus by a low-order rational function of
frequency. We use here such an approximation and show how it can be
incorporated in the velocity-pressure formulation for viscoacoustic waves. This
formulation is coupled with the fictitious domain method which permit us to
model efficiently diffraction by objects of complicated geometry and with the
Perfectly Matched Layer Model which allows us to model wave propagation in
unbounded domains. The space discretization of the problem is based on a mixed
finite element method and for the discretization in time a 2nd order centered
finite difference scheme is employed. Several numerical examples illustrate the
efficiency of the method.

and a driving electric force. In this article, we address the asymptotics of
these equations for high frequency electric fields, in a weakly coupled regime.
We prove the convergence towards rate equations (i.e. linear Boltzmann
equations, describing the transitions between energy levels of the atom). We
give an explicit form for the transition rates. This has already been performed
in [BFCD03] in the case when the energy levels are fixed, and for different
classes of electric fields: quasi or almost periodic, KBM, or with continuous
spectrum. Here, we extend the study to the case when energy levels are possibly
almost degenerate. However, we need to restrict to quasiperiodic forcings. The
techniques used stem from manipulations on the density matrix and the averaging
theory for ordinary differential equations. Possibly perturbed small divisor
estimates play a key role in the analysis. In the case of a finite number of
energy levels, we also precisely analyze the initial time-layer in the rate
aquation, as well as the long-time convergence towards equilibrium. We give
hints and counterexamples in the infinite dimensional case.

are found too. The fundamental DSs and two-solitons bound states are stable in
all the cases when the CW background is stable, which is shown by dint of

simulations. Tilted DSs are found too. They attain a maximum contrast at a
finite value of the tilt, that does not depend on the phase mismatch. At a
maximum value of the tilt, which grows with the mismatch, the DS merges into
the CW background. Interactions between the tilted solitons are shown to be

$\sigma_0$ is some fixed cross section (perhaps $\sigma_0 \sim

viscosity is made proportional to $T^3$. This model is typical of high

times larger than the $T/\sigma_0$ model, the two models of viscosity produce

interesting symmetries between the logics of inference and inquiry; where
probability describes the degree to which a premise implies an assertion, there
exists an analogous measure that describes the bearing or relevance that a
question has on an outstanding issue. These have been extended to suggest that
the logic of inquiry results in functional relationships analogous to, although
more general than, those found in information theory.
  Employing lattice theory, I examine in greater detail the structure of the
space of assertions and questions demonstrating that the symmetries between the
logical relations in each of the spaces derive directly from the lattice
structure. Furthermore, I show that while symmetries between the spaces exist,
the two lattices are not isomorphic. The lattice of assertions is described by
a Boolean lattice 2^N, whereas the lattice of assuredly real questions is shown
to be a sublattice of the free distributive lattice 2^(2^N). Thus there does
not exist a one-to-one mapping of assertions to questions, there is no
reflection symmetry between the two spaces, and questions in general do not
possess complements. Last, with these lattice structures in mind, I discuss the
relationship between probability, relevance, and entropy.

determine the residual entangling power of the light fields, inferring, thus,
the entanglement left in the field modes which, after the interaction, are no
longer in a Gaussian state. Two different set-ups are proposed: a cavity-QED
system and an interface between superconducting qubits and field modes. We
address in details the practical difficulties inherent in these two proposals,
showing that the latter is promising under many aspects.

"quant-ph/0403127","Tobias J. Osborne","Tobias J. Osborne, Simone Severini","Quantum Algorithms and Covering Spaces","24 pages, 1 figure, uses psfrag. Added reference. Fixed reference",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we isolate the combinatorial property responsible (at least in
part) for the computational speedups recently observed in some quantum walk
algorithms. We find that continuous-time quantum walks can exploit the covering
space property of certain graphs. We demonstrate that a quantum walk on a graph
Y which covers a smaller graph X can be equivalent to a quantum walk on the
smaller graph X. This equivalence occurs only when the walk begins on certain
initial states, fibre-constant states, which respect the graph covering space
structure. We illustrate these observations with walks on Cayley graphs; we
show that walks on fibre-constant initial states for Cayley graphs are
equivalent to walks on the induced Schreier graph. We also consider the problem
of constructing efficient gate sequences simulating the time evolution of a
continuous-time quantum walk. For the case of the walk on the m-torus graph T^m
on 2^n vertices we construct a gate sequence which uses O(\poly(n)) gates which
is independent of the time t the walk is simulated for (and so the sequence can
simulate the walk for exponential times). We argue that there exists a wide
class of nontrivial operators based on quantum walks on graphs which can be
measured efficiently. We introduce a new general class of computational
problems, HiddenCover, which includes a variant of the general hidden subgroup
problem as a subclass. We argue that quantum computers ought to be able to
utilise covering space structures to efficiently solve HiddenCover problems.

radiation force of Casimir-Polder type acting on an atom which is positioned
near dispersing and absorbing magnetodielectric bodies and initially prepared
in an arbitrary electronic state. It is shown that minimal and multipolar
coupling lead to essentially the same lowest-order perturbative result for the
force acting on an atom in an energy eigenstate. To go beyond perturbation
theory, the calculations are based on the exact center-of-mass equation of
motion. For a nondriven atom in the weak-coupling regime, the force as a
function of time is a superposition of force components that are related to the
electronic density-matrix elements at a chosen time. Even the force component
associated with the ground state is not derivable from a potential in the
ususal way, because of the position dependence of the atomic polarizability.
Further, when the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of
energy eigenstates, then temporally oscillating force components are observed,
which are due to the interaction of the atom with both electric and magnetic
fields.
