of them is accurately known (assuming black hole spin and mass and jet Lorentz
factor differences are unimportant or minimal). Finally, we observed a strong

are compared with new models, for dust enshrouded galaxies, which account for
both starburst and AGN components. In all 7 galaxies the starburst provides the
dominant contribution to the infrared luminosity; in 4 sources no contribution
from an AGN is required. Although AGN may contribute up to 50 percent of the
total far--infrared emission, the starbursts always dominate in the radio. The
SEDs of most of our sources are best fit with a very high optical depth of
(>=50) at 1 micron. The scatter in the far-infrared/radio correlation, found
among luminous IRAS sources, is due mainly to the different evolutionary status
of their starburst components. The short time-scale of the star formation
process amplifies the delay between the far-infrared and radio emission. This
becomes more evident at low radio frequencies (below about 1 GHz) where
synchrotron radiation is the dominant process. In the far-infrared (at
wavelengths shorter than 100 micron) an additional source of scatter is
provided by AGN, where present. AGN may be detected in the near-infrared by the
absence of the knee, typical of stellar photospheres. However, near-infrared
data alone cannot constrain the level at which AGN contribute because the
interpretation of their observed properties, in this wave-band, depends
strongly on model parameters.

influences the morphology of the dust temperature structure on a large scale

underheated compared to a model without the accretion discs because the
radiation from the light sources is blocked/shadowed by the discs. The spectral

Afterglow emission was detected in X-rays and at optical wavelengths while no
emission was detected at 8 GHz brighter than 120 microJy. The decaying X-ray
afterglow, back extrapolated to 11 hr after the burst, had a flux of 7.9 10^-12
cgs (2-10 keV); the brightest detected so far. No direct redshift determination
is available yet for this GRB, but according to the empirical relationship
between the peak energy in the \nu F_\nu spectrum and the isotropic energy
output, z is constrained in the range 0.9-1.5. The reconstructed optical
afterglow light curve implies at least two breaks in the simple power-law
decay. This may be related to emergence of a SN, or refreshment of the external
shock by a variation in the circumstellar medium. By comparing the backward
extrapolation of the 2-10 keV afterglow decay it is shown that the long
duration of the prompt emission is not related to an early onset of afterglow
emission, but must be related to prolonged activity of the ``central engine''.

four new spectroscopic redshifts, bringing the total to thirteen confirmed arcs

weakly-sheared background galaxies to model the total mass distribution in the
cluster cores (R<=500kpc). These models are complemented by high-resolution
X-ray data from Chandra and used to develop quantitative criteria to classify
the clusters as relaxed or unrelaxed. Formally, (30+/-20)% of the clusters form
a homogeneous sub-sample of relaxed clusters; the remaining (70+/-20)% are
unrelaxed and are a much more diverse population. Most of the clusters
therefore appear to be experiencing a cluster-cluster merger, or relaxing after
such an event. We also study the normalization and scatter of scaling relations
between cluster mass, luminosity and temperature. The scatter in these
relations is dominated by the unrelaxed clusters and is typically sigma~0.4.
Most notably, we detect 2-3 times more scatter in the mass-temperature relation
than theoretical simulations and models predict. The observed scatter is also
asymmetric - the unrelaxed systems are systematically 40% hotter than the
relaxed clusters at 2.5 sigma significance. This structural segregation should
be a major concern for experiments designed to constrain cosmological
parameters using galaxy clusters. Overall our results are consistent with a
scenario of cluster-cluster merger induced boosts to cluster X-ray luminosities
and temperatures. [Abridged]

conclusion that the time-scale for the peak of the SNIa rate is of the order

distribution of 1612 MHz sources by means of the distance determination of
OH/IR sources from their kinematical information; 3) an analysis of near and
mid-infrared star counts and comparison with models. All the tests give the
same result: a defect of stars in the inner disc with respect to an exponential
disc (either with constant scaleheight or extrapolated from the outer disc),
but only in near plane regions. This deficit might be interpreted as a flare in
the vertical distribution. The in-plane density is almost independent of R and
not an exponential law. Further away from the plane, however, the density
increases towards the centre due to the increase of the scaleheight. Tests also
show that this result cannot be due to extinction. The deficit affects both the

($z=0.0881$) relaxed cluster of galaxies A478. We derive precise gas density,
gas temperature, gas mass and total mass profiles up to $12\arcmin$ (about half
of the virial radius $R_{200}$). The gas density profile is highly peaked
towards the center and the surface brightness profile is well fitted by a sum
of three $\beta$--models. The derived gas density profile is in excellent
agreement, both in shape and in normalization, with the published Chandra
density profile (measured within $5\arcmin$ of the center). Projection and PSF
effects on the temperature profile determination are thoroughly investigated.
The derived radial temperature structure is as expected for a cluster hosting a
cooling core, with a strong negative gradient at the cluster center. The
temperature rises from $\sim2$ keV up to a plateau of $\sim6.5$ keV beyond 2'
(i.e. $r>208\rm{kpc}=0.1 R_{200}$, $R_{200}=2.08$ Mpc being the virial radius).
  From the temperature profile and the density profile and under the hypothesis
of hydrostatic equilibrium, we derived the total mass profile of A478 down to
0.01 and up to 0.5 the virial radius. We tested different dark matter models
against the observed mass profile. The Navarro, Frenk & White
(\cite{navarro97}) model is significantly preferred to other models. It leads
to a total mass of $M_{200}=1.1\times 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ for a concentration
parameter of $c=4.2\pm0.4$. The gas mass fraction slightly increases with
radius. The gas mass fraction at a density contrast of $\delta=2500$ is
$\fgas=0.13\pm0.02$, consistent with previous results on similar hot and
massive clusters. We confirm the excess of absorption in the direction of
A478.[abridged]

We performed an accurate statistical analysis in order to assess whether GGCs
show a statistically significant spread in their initial He abundances, and
whether there is a correlation with the metallicity. We do not find any
significant dependence of the He abundance on the GC metallicity; this provides
an important constraint for models of Galaxy formation and evolution. Apart
from GGCs with the bluest HB morphology, the observed spread in the individual
He abundances is statistically compatible with the individual errors. This
means that either there is no intrinsic He spread among the GGCs, or that this
is masked by the errors. In the latter case we have estimated a firm 1$\sigma$
upper limit of 0.019 to the possible intrinsic spread. In case of the GGCs with
the bluest HB morphology we detect a significant spread towards higher
abundances inconsistent with the individual errors. In the hypothesis that the
intrinsic dispersion on the individual He abundances is zero, taking into
account the errors on the individual R-parameter estimates, as well as the
uncertainties on the GGC [M/H] scale and theoretical calibration, we have

compact binaries with the proposed LISA space interferometer. Specifically, we
estimate lower bounds on the coupling parameter \omega of scalar-tensor
theories of the Brans-Dicke type and on the Compton wavelength of the graviton
\lambda_g in hypothetical massive graviton theories. In these theories,
modifications of the gravitational radiation damping formulae or of the
propagation of the waves translate into a change in the phase evolution of the
observed gravitational waveform. We obtain the bounds through the technique of
matched filtering, employing the LISA Sensitivity Curve Generator (SCG),
available online. For a neutron star inspiralling into a 10^3 M_sun black hole
in the Virgo Cluster, in a two-year integration, we find a lower bound \omega >
3 * 10^5. For lower-mass black holes, the bound could be as large as 2 * 10^6.
The bound is independent of LISA arm length, but is inversely proportional to
the LISA position noise error. Lower bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength
ranging from 10^15 km to 5 * 10^16 km can be obtained from one-year
observations of massive binary black hole inspirals at cosmological distances
(3 Gpc), for masses ranging from 10^4 to 10^7 M_sun. For the highest-mass
systems (10^7 M_sun), the bound is proportional to (LISA arm length)^{1/2} and
to (LISA acceleration noise)^{-1/2}. For the others, the bound is independent
of these parameters because of the dominance of white-dwarf confusion noise in
the relevant part of the frequency spectrum. These bounds improve and extend
earlier work which used analytic formulae for the noise curves.

that our ``covariant symplectic'' Hamiltonian-boundary-term quasilocal

cross sections for arbitrary angular momentum of the scalar field are computed
numerically in the full range of energy by making use of the analytic
near-horizon and asymptotic solutions and their analytic continuations. The
scalar mass makes an interesting effect in the low-energy absorption cross
section for S-wave. Unlike the massless case, the cross section decreases with
increasing energy in the extremely low-energy regime. As a result the
universality, {\it i.e.} low-energy cross section for S-wave is equal to the
horizon area, is broken in the presence of mass. If the scalar mass is larger
than a critical mass, the absorption cross section becomes monotonically
decreasing function in the entire range of energy. The Hawking emission is also
calculated numerically. It turns out that the Planck factor generally
suppresses the contribution of higher partial waves except S-wave. The scalar
mass in general tends to reduce the emission rate.

it is possible to define the Dirac operator on the space of anti-symmetric

environments driven by a continuous-variable correlated field. We find the
conditions to transfer the entanglement from the driving field to the qubits
both in dynamical and steady-state cases. We see how the quantum correlations
initially present in the driving field play a critical role in the
entanglement-transfer process. The system we treat is general enough to be
adapted to different physical setups.
