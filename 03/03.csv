spiral galaxies. We discuss the structural properties, stellar populations, and
dynamical masses of the compact, luminous star cluster that is found in the
nuclei of most late-type spiral galaxies. Although preliminary, our results
strongly indicate that many galaxies of our sample experience repeated periods
of nuclear star formation. While the exact mechanism that leads to the required
high gas densities in the galaxy nucleus remains unclear, results from our
recent CO survey of late-type spirals demonstrate that in most cases, the
central kpc contains enough molecular gas to support repetitive nuclear
starbursts.

halo of the Andromeda galaxy. Taken with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph
on the Keck2 telescope, these data display a narrow velocity dispersion of
11+/-3 km/s, with a steady radial velocity gradient of 245 km/s over the 125
kpc radial extent of the stream studied so far. This implies that the Andromeda
galaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream
in different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge,
disk and halo, where the halo follows a ``universal'' profile that is
compressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the
kinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of
7.5^(+2.5)_(-1.3) x 10^{11} M_Sun, or more than 5.4 x 10^{11} M_Sun at the 99%
confidence level. This is the first galaxy in which it has been possible to
measure the halo mass distribution by such direct dynamical means over such a
large distance range. The resulting orbit shows that if M32 or NGC 205 are
connected with the stream, they must either trail or lag the densest region of
the stream by more than 100 kpc. Furthermore, according to the best-fit orbit,
the stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure
and producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby
confusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations. Our
data show that several recently identified planetary nebulae, which have been
proposed as evidence for the existence of a new companion of M31, are likely
members of the Andromeda Stream.

present exact evaluations of the likelihood of the low multipoles by direct
inversion of the theoretical covariance matrix for low resolution WMAP maps. We
project out the unwanted galactic contaminants rather than subtract them, which
can remove some of the cosmological signal and may lead to a suppression of
power. We find an increase in power at low multipoles. For the quadrupole the
maximum likelihood values are rather uncertain and vary between 140-220\muK^2.
On the other hand, the probability distribution away from the peak is robust
and, assuming a uniform prior between 0 an 2000\muK^2, the probability of
having the true value above 1200\muK^2 (as predicted by the simplest Lambda CDM
model) is 10%, a factor of 2.5 higher than predicted by WMAP likelihood code.
We develop a fast likelihood evaluation routine that can be used instead of
WMAP routines for low l values. We apply it to the MCMC analysis to compare the
cosmological parameters between the two cases. The new analysis of WMAP either
alone or jointly with SDSS and VSA reduces the reported 2-sigma evidence for
running to less than 1-sigma, giving \alpha_s=-0.022\pm 0.033 for the combined
case. The new analysis prefers about 1-sigma lower value of Omega_m, a
consequence of an increased ISW contribution required by the increase in the
spectrum at low l. These results suggest that the details of foreground removal
and full likelihood analysis are important for the parameter estimation from
WMAP data and these methods should be particularly useful in the analysis of
polarisation, where foreground contamination may be much more severe.

results. First, the ratio between the azimuthally averaged EUV excess emission
and the ROSAT hard X-ray flux is constant as a function of distance from the
cluster center outward. Second, a correlation analysis between the EUV excess
emission and the X-ray emission shows that on a detailed level the EUV excess
is spatially closely related to the X-ray emission. These findings contradict
previous suggestions as to the underlying source of the diffuse EUV emission in
Coma and provide important information in regards to the true source of this
emission. We propose a new explanation for the source of this emission: inverse
Compton scattering of microwave background photons by secondary electrons and
positrons. We explore this possibility in some detail and show that it is
consistent with all of the available observational evidence. The parent cosmic
ray protons may have been produced by any of a number of sources, including
supernovae, active galaxies, galactic winds, and cluster formation shocks, but
we believe that the most likely source is cluster formation shocks. If the EUV
emission in the Coma Cluster is, in fact, the result of secondary electrons,
this may be the only direct evidence for secondary electrons in the
intracluster medium of a cluster of galaxies, since recent work suggests that
secondary electrons may not be the cause of radio halos.

solar-type stars. During the circularization of their orbits, the dissipation
of tidal disturbance by their host stars heats the interior and inflates the
sizes of these planets. Based on a series of internal structure calculations
for giant planets, we examine the physical processes which determine their
luminosity-radius relation. In order for young or intensely heated gas giant
planets to attain quasi-hydrostatic equilibria, with sizes comparable to or
larger than two Jupiter radii, their interiors must have sufficiently high
temperature and low density such that degeneracy effects are relatively weak
compared to those in a mature and compact Jupiter. Consequently, the polytropic
index monotonically increases whereas the central temperature increases and
then decreases with the planets' size. These effects, along with a
temperature-sensitive opacity for the radiative surface layers of giant
planets, cause the power index of the luminosity's dependence on radius to
decrease with increasing radius. For planets larger than twice Jupiter's
radius, this index is sufficiently small that they become unstable to tidal
inflation. We make comparisons between cases of uniform heating and cases in
which the heating is concentrated in various locations within the giant planet.
Based on these results we suggest that accurate measurement of the sizes of
close-in young Jupiters can be used to probe their internal structure under the
influence of tidal heating.

overlapping region with the medium deep ROSAT survey. These candidates are
selected using the multi-color CCD imaging observations made for the T329 field
of the Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut (BATC) Sky Survey. These X-ray
sources are relatively faint (CR $<< 0.2 s^{-1}$) and thus mostly are not
included in the RBS catalog, they also remain as X-ray sources without optical
candidates in a previous identification program carried out by the Hamburg
Quasar Survey. Within their position-error circles, almost all the X-ray
sources are observed to have one or more spatially associated optical
candidates within them down to the magnitude $m_V \sim 23.1$. We have
classified 149 of 156 detected optical candidates with 73 of the 75 X-ray
sources with a SED-based Object Classification Approach (SOCA). These optical
candidates include: 31 QSOs, 39 stars, 37 starburst galaxies, 42 galaxies, and
7 ""just"" visible objects. We have also cross-correlated the positions of these
optical objects with NED, the FIRST radio source catalog and the 2MASS catalog.
Separately, we have also SED-classified the remaining 6011 objects in our field
of view. Optical objects are found at the $6.5\sigma$ level above what one
would expect from a random distribution, only QSOs are over-represented in
these error circles at greater than 4$\sigma$ frequency. We estimate redshifts
for all extragalactic objects, and find a good correspondence of our predicted
redshift with the measured redshift (a mean error of 0.04 in $\Delta z$. There
appears to be a supercluster at z $\sim$ 0.3-0.35 in this direction, including
many of the galaxies in the X-ray error circles are found in this redshift

medium in galaxies contains a molecular gas phase that may represent a
significant and even the dominant amount of its mass in metal-poor regions. In
spiral galaxies such regions are found at large galactocentric distances where
diffuse H$_2$ gas will be untraceable through its feeble $ ^{12}$CO J=1--0
emission, the very lack of it being also responsible its higher kinetic
temperatures ($\rm T_k\sim 60-100$ K). Sensitive sub-mm imaging of spiral
galaxies has demonstrated the existence of dust well inside their HI gas
distribution while recent observational work suggests a high H$_2$ formation
rate from HI association onto grains. The latter is indeed a critical unknown
and a high value can easily compensate for the reduction of the available grain
surface in the metal-poor environments giving rise to a CO-poor, diffuse H$_2$
phase that may then contribute significantly to the mass and pressure of the
interstellar medium in such environments.

explain the recent experimental data in a comprehensive fashion. At low
coverages, as shown by previous works, `Para' dimers give the lowest energy
structure. With increasing coverage beyond 0.5 ML, `Ortho' dimers become part
of low energy configurations leading toward a `Para' to `Ortho' transition at 1
ML coverage. For In mixed staggered dimers (`Ortho' and `Para') give the lowest
energy configuration. For Ga, mixed dimers are non-staggered, while for Al
`Para' to `Ortho' transition of dimers is complete. Thus at intermediate
coverages between 0.5 and 1 ML, the `Ortho' and `Para' dimers may coexist on
the surface. Consequently, this may be an explanation of the fact that the
experimental observations can be successfully interpreted using either
orientation. A supported zigzag structure at 0.5 ML, which resembles ${\rm
(CH)_x}$, does not undergo a dimerization transition, and hence stays
semi-metallic. Also, unlike ${\rm (CH)_x}$ the soliton formation is ruled out

point in the two dimensional t-J-U model with an on-site repulsion U. The
theory of low energy phase fluctuations around this saddle point is derived in
terms of the effective hard-core bosons (representing the density of spin-up
electrons and the order parameter phase), interacting with the fluctuating
density of spin-down electrons. Whereas the saddle point value of the gap is
found to monotonically increase towards half filling, the phase stiffness at
T=0 has a maximum, and then decreases with further underdoping. Right at half
filling the stiffness vanishes for large U.
  This argues that the pseudogap phenomenon of the type observed in cuprates is
in principle possible without a development of any competing order, purely as a
result of growing correlations in the superconducting state. The effects of
finite temperature and disorder are discussed qualitatively.

found that such an anomalously long collapse time is caused by the slow energy
exchange between a higher-temperature compact core and relatively cold diluted

particles and slower-moving particles of the halo is exponentially small in the

provides clear evidence for the existence of a new type of four-well tunneling

are closely linked with the fourfold split positions of Eu known from neutron
diffraction density profiles. Using a realistic potential we estimate the
tunneling frequencies and show that the energy gap between the two FLS's is of
the same order as the Einstein oscillator frequency. This explains why the
observed harmonic oscillator type specific heat is not modified by tunneling
states. In addition the quadrupolar interaction of FLS's with elastic strains
explains the pronounced depression observed in elastic constant measurements.
In the case of the Sr clathrate, we show that the shallow dip in the elastic
constant c44 is explained using the same type of quadrupolar interaction with a
soft Einstein mode instead of a FLS.

513] for granular mixtures subject to stochastic driving have shown the
validity of the Einstein relation $\epsilon\equiv D/(T_0\lambda)=1$ between the
diffusion $D$ and mobility $\lambda$ coefficients when the temperature of the
gas $T$ is replaced by the temperature of the impurity $T_0$ in the usual
Einstein relation. This problem is analyzed in this paper by solving
analytically the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation from the Chapman-Enskog method. The
gas is heated by the action of an external driving force (thermostat) which
does work to compensate for the collisional loss of energy. Two types of
thermostats are considered: (a) a deterministic force proportional to the
particle velocity (Gaussian thermostat), and (b) a white noise external force
(stochastic thermostat). The diffusion and mobility coefficients are given in
terms of the solutions of two linear integral equations, which are
approximately solved up to the second order in a Sonine polynomial expansion.
The results show that the violation of the Einstein relation ($\epsilon\neq 1$)
is only due to the non-Maxwellian behavior of the impurity velocity
distribution function (absence of the Gibbs state). At a quantitative level,
the kinetic theory results also show that the deviation of $\epsilon$ from 1 is
more significant in the case of the Gaussian thermostat than in the case of the
stochastic one, in which case the deviation of the Einstein relation is in
general smaller than 1%. This conclusion agrees quite well with the results
found in computer simulations.

temperature and ionic concentration. This model, which usually yields better
fits than others, is indirectly associated with temporal-domain
stretched-exponential response having the same beta1 parameter value. Here it
is shown that for the above conditions several different analyses yield the
important and unique value of exactly 1/3 for the beta1 of the K1 model. It is
therefore appropriate to fix the beta1 parameter of this model at the constant
value of 1/3, then defined as the U model. It fits data sets exhibiting
conductive-system dispersion that vary with both temperature and concentration
just as well as those with beta1 free to vary, and it leads to a

the UA(1) breaking Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft interaction by solving the
Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. The dynamically generated
momentum-dependent quark mass is large enough in the low momentum region to
give rise to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Due to the large
dynamical quark mass, the scalar mesons become the q bar{q} bound states. Since
the parameters have been all fixed to reproduce the light pseudoscalar meson
masses and the decay constant, there is no free parameter in the calculation of
the scalar mesons. We obtain $M_{sigma} = 667$ MeV, $M_{a_0} = 942$ MeV and
$M_{f_0} = 1336$ MeV. They are in good agreement with the observed masses of
$sigma(600)$, $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(1370)$, respectively. We therefore conclude
that these states are the members of the light scalar meson nonet. The mass of

Noting that the known perturbative corrections to two-loop order are suppressed
by a factor 1/N_c^2, relative to those for higher moments, we propose that this
suppression persists at higher orders and also applies to higher-twist effects.
Moreover, we propose that the differences between the corresponding radiative
corrections to higher non-singlet moments in charged-lepton and neutrino deep
inelastic scattering are suppressed by 1/N_c^2, in all orders of perturbation
theory. For the first moment, in the Gottfried sum rule, the substantial
discrepancy between the measured value and the valence-model expectation may be
attributed to an intrinsic isospin asymmetry in the nucleon sea, as is indeed
the case in a chiral-soliton model, where the discrepancy persists in the limit

  spacetimes","latex2e, 50 pages",,,,"hep-th gr-qc math-ph math.MP",,"  This article presents a precise description of the interplay between the
symmetries of a quantum or classical theory with spacetime interpretation, and
some of its physical properties relating to causality, horizons and positive
energy. Our major result is that the existence of static metrics on spacetimes
and that of positive energy representations of symmetry groups, are equivalent
to the existence of particular Adjoint-invariant convex cones in the symmetry
algebras. This can be used to study backgrounds of supergravity and string
theories through their symmetry groups. Our formalism is based on Segal's
approach to infinitesimal causal structures on manifolds. The Adjoint action in
the symmetry group is shown to correspond to changes of inertial frames in the
spacetime, whereas Adjoint-invariance encodes invariance under changes of
observers. This allows us to give a group theoretical description of the
horizon structure of spacetimes, and also to lift causal structures to the
Hilbert spaces of quantum theories. Among other results, by setting up the
Dirac procedure for the complexified universal algebra, we classify the
physically inequivalent observables of quantum theories. We illustrate this by
finding the different Hamiltonians for stationary observers in AdS_2.

dt $$ is identical in law with the first hitting time of a point for some other
diffusion. This phenomenon may often be explained using random time change.
Because of some potential applications in mathematical finance, we are
considering mainly the case when $X$ is a Brownian motion with drift $\mu>0,$
denoted $\{B^{(\mu)}_t: t\geq 0\},$ but it is obvious that the method presented
is more general. We also review the known examples and give new ones. In
particular, results concerning one-sided functionals $$ \int_0^\infty
f(B^{(\mu)}_t) {\bf 1}_{\{B^{(\mu)}_t<0\}} dt\quad {\rm and}\quad \int_0^\infty
f(B^{(\mu)}_t) {\bf 1}_{\{B^{(\mu)}_t>0\}} dt $$ are presented.
  This approach generalizes the proof, based on the random time change
techniques, of the fact that the Dufresne functional (this corresponds to
$f(x)=\exp(-2x)),$ playing quite an important r\^ole in the study of geometric
Brownian motion, is identical in law with the first hitting time for a Bessel
process. Another functional arising naturally in this context is %associated to
the function $$ \int_0^\infty \big(a+\exp(B^{(\mu)}_t)\big)^{-2} dt, $$ which
is seen, in the case $\mu=1/2,$ to be identical in law with the first hitting
time for a Brownian motion with drift $\mu=a/2.$
  The paper is concluded by discussing how the Feynman-Kac formula can be used
to find the distribution of a perpetual integral functional.

extensive chaos), for a sufficiently large domain, if the kinematic viscosity
and the amplitude and length scale of the forcing are held fixed. For
sufficiently small domain area, a slightly ``super-extensive'' estimate becomes
optimal. In the extensive regime, the attractor-dimension estimate is given by
the ratio of the domain area to the square of the dissipation length scale
defined, on physical grounds, in terms of the average rate of shear. This
dissipation length scale (which is not necessarily the scale at which the
energy or enstrophy dissipation takes place) can be identified with the
dimension correlation length scale, the square of which is interpreted,
according to the concept of extensive chaos, as the area of a subsystem with
one degree of freedom. Furthermore, these length scales can be identified with
a ``minimum length scale'' of the flow, which is rigorously deduced from the
concept of determining nodes.

Bethe-Salpeter equations are explored. It is argued that quenched lattice data
indicate the existence of net attraction in the colour-octet projection of the
quark-antiquark scattering kernel. This attraction affects the uniformity with
which solutions of truncated equations converge pointwise to solutions of the
complete gap and vertex equations. For current-quark masses less than the scale
set by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the dependence of the
dressed-quark-gluon vertex on the current-quark mass is weak. The study employs
a vertex model whose diagrammatic content is explicitly enumerable. That
enables the systematic construction of a vertex-consistent Bethe-Salpeter
kernel and thereby an exploration of the consequences for the strong
interaction spectrum of attraction in the colour-octet channel. With rising
current-quark mass the rainbow-ladder truncation is shown to provide an
increasingly accurate estimate of a bound state's mass. Moreover, the
calculated splitting between vector and pseudoscalar meson masses vanishes as
the current-quark mass increases, which argues for the mass of the pseudoscalar
partner of the \Upsilon(1S) to be above 9.4 GeV. The absence of
colour-antitriplet diquarks from the strong interaction spectrum is contingent
upon the net amount of attraction in the octet projected quark-antiquark
scattering kernel. There is a window within which diquarks appear. The amount
of attraction suggested by lattice results is outside this domain.

electromagnetic properties. However, their calculation was shown to be based on
a bound-state wave function which violates the localization condition in
quantum mechanics.
  There is one important lesson to be learned from the mistake made by Dashen
and Frautschi. They did not pay much attention to the fact that there are
running waves and standing waves in quantum mechanics. The S-matrix formalism
is based on running waves, while bound-state problem are based on normalizable
wave functions which are standing waves. Wave functions contained in the S
matrix are analytic continuations of running waves, and they do not in general
satisfy the localization condition for bound states.
  These days, there are very serious questions raised against string theory. Is
string theory a form of quantum field theory? Is it a physical theory or only a
mathematical exercise. Is a new new Einstein going to emerge from string
theory? It is pointed out that, if the distinction is recognized between
running and standing waves, string theory has its place in the historical
roadmap land-marked by Einstein, Heisenberg, Schr\""odinger, Dirac, Wigner, and

generalize Boolean implication among logical statements to degrees of
implication, which are manipulated using rules derived from consistency with
Boolean algebra. These rules are known as the sum rule, the product rule and
Bayes' Theorem, and the measure resulting from this generalization is
probability. In this paper, I will describe how Cox's technique can be further
generalized to include other algebras and hence other problems in science and
mathematics. The result is a methodology that can be used to generalize an
algebra to a calculus by relying on consistency with order theory to derive the
laws of the calculus. My goals are to clear up the mysteries as to why the same
basic structure found in probability theory appears in other contexts, to
better understand the foundations of probability theory, and to extend these
ideas to other areas by developing new mathematics and new physics. The
relevance of this methodology will be demonstrated using examples from
probability theory, number theory, geometry, information theory, and quantum
mechanics.

  Biosciences and Engineering",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  Noise, through its interaction with the nonlinearity of the living systems,
can give rise to counter-intuitive phenomena such as stochastic resonance,
noise-delayed extinction, temporal oscillations, and spatial patterns. In this
paper we briefly review the noise-induced effects in three different
ecosystems: (i) two competing species; (ii) three interacting species, one
predator and two preys, and (iii) N-interacting species. The transient dynamics
of these ecosystems are analyzed through generalized Lotka-Volterra equations
in the presence of multiplicative noise, which models the interaction between
the species and the environment. The interaction parameter between the species
is random in cases (i) and (iii), and a periodical function, which accounts for
the environmental temperature, in case (ii). We find noise-induced phenomena
such as quasi-deterministic oscillations, stochastic resonance, noise-delayed
extinction, and noise-induced pattern formation with nonmonotonic behaviors of
patterns areas and of the density correlation as a function of the
multiplicative noise intensity. The asymptotic behavior of the time average of
the \emph{$i^{th}$} population when the ecosystem is composed of a great number
of interacting species is obtained and the effect of the noise on the
asymptotic probability distributions of the populations is discussed.

Lett. 18(2), 107 (2005)","10.1007/s10702-005-3956-4",,"quant-ph",,"  We derive two complementarity relations that constrain the individual and
bipartite properties that may simultaneously exist in a multi-qubit system. The
first expression, valid for an arbitrary pure state of n qubits, demonstrates
that the degree to which single particle properties are possessed by an
individual member of the system is limited by the bipartite entanglement that
exists between that qubit and the remainder of the system. This result implies
that the phenomenon of entanglement sharing is one specific consequence of
complementarity. The second expression, which holds for an arbitrary state of
two qubits, pure or mixed, quantifies a tradeoff between the amounts of
entanglement, separable uncertainty, and single particle properties that are
encoded in the quantum state. The separable uncertainty is a natural measure of
our ignorance about the properties possessed by individual subsystems, and may
be used to completely characterize the relationship between entanglement and
mixedness in two-qubit systems. The two-qubit complementarity relation yields a
useful geometric picture in which the root mean square values of local
subsystem properties act like coordinates in the space of density matrices, and
suggests possible insights into the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics.

communication capacity of a quantum channel with correlated noise. The channel
is modelled by a fiber optic link exhibiting random birefringence that
fluctuates on a time scale much longer than the temporal separation between
consecutive uses of the channel. In this setting, introducing entanglement
between two photons travelling down the fiber allows one to encode reliably up
to one bit of information into their joint polarization degree of freedom. When
no quantum correlations between two separate uses of the channel are allowed,
this capacity is reduced by a factor of more than three. We demonstrated this
effect using a fiber-coupled source of entagled photon pairs based on
spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and a linear-optics Bell state
measurement.

one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state $\rho$, which should be regarded as a
parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which $\rho$ universal
quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this
question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of
$\rho$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The
protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain ""magic""
directions. If the polarization of $\rho$ along a magic direction exceeds a
threshold value (about 65%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure
state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations
combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection
of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.

investigate this using a model quantum clock to measure the time of flight of a
