HST/ACS Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF). Since the majority of these sources are
likely to be z~6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the F775W i'-band and
F850LP z'-band arises from Lyman-alpha absorption, the number of detected
candidates provides a valuable upper limit to the unextincted star formation
rate at this redshift. We demonstrate that the increased depth of UDF enables
us to reach an 8-sigma limiting magnitude of z'(AB)=28.5 (equivalent to
1.5/h{70}^2 M_sun/yr at z=6, or 0.1 L*(UV) for the z~3 U-drop population),
permitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved form
of the luminosity function. We identify 54 galaxies (and only one star) at
z'(AB)<28.5 with (i'-z')>1.3 over the deepest 11arcmin^2 portion of the UDF
field. The characteristic luminosity (L*) is consistent with values observed at
z~3. The faint end slope (alpha) is less well constrained, but is consistent
with only modest evolution. The main change appears to be in the number density
(Phi*). Specifically, and regardless of possible contamination from cool stars
and lower redshift sources, the UDF data support our previous result that the
star formation rate at z~6 was at least x6 LESS than at z~3 (Stanway, Bunker &
McMahon 2003). This declining comoving star formation rate (0.005
h{70}M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 at z~6 for a Salpeter IMF) poses an interesting challenge
for models which suggest that L>0.1L* star forming galaxies at z~6 reionized
the universe. The
  short-fall in ionizing photons might be alleviated by galaxies
  fainter than our limit, or a radically different IMF.
  Alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have occurred at z>>6.

microlensing activity above expectations for the stellar lenses alone in M31

distribution in timescale and across the face of M31 indicates a microlensing
dark matter halo fraction consistent with that seen in our Galaxy towards the
LMC (Alcock et al. 2000). For a nearly singular isothermal sphere model, we
find a microlensing halo mass fraction f=0.29 +0.30/-0.13 of total dark matter,

between them there is significant evidence for asymmetry in the distribution of

9/8 to 2.8 Schwarzschild radii. For the more compact models, we included the
important effect of self-irradiation of the atmosphere. Because of the
extremely low column density to J1118, we obtained very strong limits on a
hypothetical thermal source: kT(infinity) < 0.011 keV and L(infinity) < 9.4E30

possible sources of thermal radiation from a hypothetical surface of J1118:
deep crustal heating and accretion in quiescence. We conclude that if J1118

thermal radiation from this surface. The absence of thermal radiation indicates
that J1118 is a true black hole with an event horizon.

well-known from recent MACHO, EROS and OGLE observations that the corresponding
optical depth for the Galactic halo and the Galactic bulge is lower than
$10^{-6}$. Cosmologically distributed gravitational microlenses could be
localized in galaxies (or even in bulge or halo of gravitational macrolenses)
or could be distributed in a uniform way. We have analyzed both cases of such
distributions. As a result of our analysis, we obtained that an optical depth
for microlensing caused by stellar mass objects is usually small for quasar

reach $10^{-2} - 0.1$ at $z\sim 2$. It means that cosmologically distributed
deflectors may significantlly contribute to the X-ray variability of
high-redshifted QSOs ($z>2$). Considering that upper limit of the optical depth

distributed deflectors, therefore observations of X-ray variations of unlensend

provide reliable estimates of nuclear black hole masses and errors when
constructed from adequate orbit libraries and kinematic data. We thus rebut two
recent papers that argue that BH masses obtained from this method are
unreliable. These papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable BH
masses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result of
an inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamical
models. This is an elementary error that is easily avoided. We describe a
method to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. We
provide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sense
that the range of allowable BH masses is not artificially narrowed by use of
too few orbits. A second point raised by critics is that kinematic data are
generally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliable
mass. We make the distinction between unreliable determinations and imprecise
ones. We show that there are several different properties of a kinematic
dataset that can lead to imprecise BH determinations, but none of the
attributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. In short,
the degree to which the BH radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopic
observations is already reflected in the BH-mass error envelope, and is not a
hidden source of error. The BH masses published by our group and the Leiden
group are reliable.

the brighter of this spatially resolved system's two components as an intense
starburst that is remarkably old, massive, and metal-rich for the early epoch
at which it is observed. We see a strong Balmer break implying a > 100 Myr
timescale for continuous star formation, as well as nebular emission line
ratios implying a supersolar oxygen abundance on large spatial scales. Overall,
the system is rapidly converting a large baryonic mass into stars over the
course of only a few hundred Myr. Our study thus adds new arguments to the
growing evidence that submillimeter galaxies are more massive than Lyman break
galaxies, and more numerous at high redshift than predicted by current
semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.

Bayesian analysis presented in this brief report is restricted to the minimal
number of parameters. Yet it is useful for two reasons. It confirms the results
of Pogosian et al (2003) using an alternative statistical method. Secondly, it
justifies the more costly multi-parameter analysis. Already, varying only three
parameters -- the spectral index and the amplitudes of the adiabatic and string

The advantages of this approach are (i) X-ray emitting clusters tend to trace
the deepest potential wells and therefore have the greatest effect on the
dynamics of the Local Group and (ii) our all-sky sample provides data for
nearly a quarter of the sky that is largely incomplete in optical cluster
catalogues. We find that the direction of the Local Group's peculiar velocity
is well aligned with the CMB as early as the Great Attractor region 40 h^-1 Mpc
away, but that the amplitude of its dipole motion is largely set between 140
and 160 h^-1 Mpc. Unlike previous studies using galaxy samples, we find that
without Virgo included, roughly ~70% of our dipole signal comes from mass
concentrations at large distances (>60 h^-1 Mpc) and does not flatten,
indicating isotropy in the cluster distribution, until at least 160 h^-1 Mpc.
We also present a detailed discussion of our dipole profile, linking observed
features to the structures and superclusters that produce them. We find that
most of the dipole signal can be attributed to the Shapley supercluster
centered at about 150 h^-1 Mpc and a handful of very massive individual
clusters, some of which are newly discovered and lie well in the Zone of

near-IR excess emission observed from brown dwarfs is indeed due to
circumstellar disks, then the large scaleheights we find could have a
significant impact on the optical and near-IR detectability of such systems.
Our radiation transfer calculations show that such highly flared disks around
brown dwarfs will result in a large fraction of obscured sources due to
extinction of direct starlight by the disk over a wide range of sightlines. The
obscured fraction for a 'typical' CTTS is less than 20%. We show that the
obscured fraction for brown dwarfs may be double that for CTTS, but this
depends on stellar and disk mass. We also comment on possible confusion in
identifying brown dwarfs via color-magnitude diagrams: edge-on CTTS display
similar colors and magnitudes as a face-on brown dwarf plus disk systems.

similar to the ones seen in V Sge, V617 Sgr and in Compact Binary Supersoft
Sources - CBSS. The He II Pickering series decrement shows that the system has
significant amount of hydrogen. The He II 4686 emission lines became weaker
between the 1991 and 2000/2002 observations, indicating distinct levels of
activity. The Balmer lines show variable features with V = -2900 km/s in
absorption and with V = +/- 3500 km/s in emission. These highly variable events
remind the satellites in emission of CBSS. We estimate the color excess as
E(B-V)=0.63. Given the distance-color excess relation in the direction of WX
Cen, this implies a distance of 2.8 kpc. Interstellar absorption of the Na I D
lines show components at -4.1 km/s, which corresponds to the velocity of the
Coalsack, and three other components a -23.9, -32.0 and -39.0 km/s. These
components are also seen with similar strengths in field stars that have
distances between 1.8 and 2.7 kpc. The intrinsic color of WX Cen is (B-V)0=-0.2
and the absolute magnitude, Mv = -0.5. Extended red wings in the strong
emission lines are seen. A possible explanation is that the system has a
spill-over stream similar to what is seen in V617 Sgr. We predict that when
observed in opposite orbital phase, blue wings would be observed. The velocity
of the satellite-like feature is consistent with the idea that the central star

under consideration, the star may become a SN Ia in a time-scale of 5 X 10^6

seaweed (dense branching morphology) or doublon growth depending on
experimental parameters. We find selection of doublons to be strongly dependent
on solute concentration and sample orientation. Doublons are selected at low
concentrations (low solutal undercooling) in contrast to the prediction of
doublons at large thermal undercooling in pure materials. Doublons also exhibit
preferred growth directions and changing the orientation of a specific
doublonic grain changes the character and stability of the doublons. We observe
transitions between seaweed and doublon growth with changes in concentration
and sample orientation.

of intermediate conductances, $g\sim 1$. Interpretation of the experimental
results obtained for a 2D electron gas in GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs single

of higher orders in $1/g$, stemming from both the interference contribution and
the mutual effect of weak localization (WL) and Coulomb interaction. We
demonstrate that at intermediate conductances the negative MR is described by
the standard WL ""digamma-functions"" expression, but with a reduced prefactor
$\alpha$. We also show that at not very high $g$ the second-loop corrections
dominate over the contribution of the interaction in the Cooper channel, and
therefore appear to be the main source of the lowering of the prefactor,
$\alpha\simeq 1-2/\pi g$. We further analyze the regime of a ""weak insulator"",
when the zero-$B$ conductance is low $g(B=0)<1$ due to the localization at low
$T$, whereas the Drude conductance is high, $g_0>>1.$ In this regime, while the
MR still can be fitted by the digamma-functions formula, the experimentally
obtained value of the dephasing rate has nothing to do with the true one. The
corresponding fitting parameter in the low-$T$ limit is determined by the
localization length and may therefore saturate at $T\to 0$, even though the

2-point function of Polyakov lines. The 2-point functions agree with a
universal wave function renormalization. The large N double scaling limit
corresponds to the continuum limit of non-commutative gauge theory, so the
observed large N scaling demonstrates the non-perturbative renormalizability of
this non-commutative field theory. The area law for the Wilson loops holds at
small physical area as in commutative 2d planar gauge theory, but at large
areas we find an oscillating behavior instead. In that regime the phase of the
Wilson loop grows linearly with the area. This agrees with the Aharonov-Bohm
effect in the presence of a constant magnetic field, identified with the
inverse non-commutativity parameter. Next we investigate the 3d \lambda \phi^4
model with two non-commutative coordinates and explore its phase diagram. Our
results agree with a conjecture by Gubser and Sondhi in d=4, who predicted that
the ordered regime splits into a uniform phase and a phase dominated by stripe
patterns. We further present results for the correlators and the dispersion
relation. In non-commutative field theory the Lorentz invariance is explicitly
broken, which leads to a deformation of the dispersion relation. In one loop

all moduli to roll when searching for inflationary solutions and find that
inflation is not generic inasmuch as special choices must be made for the

for a reasonably wide range of initial conditions for the brane and antibrane.
We find that D-terms associated with the orbifold blowing-up modes play an
important role in the inflationary dynamics. Since the models contain a
standard-model-like sector after inflation, they open up the possibility of
addressing reheating issues. We calculate predictions for the CMB temperature
fluctuations and find that these can be consistent with observations, but are
generically not deep within the scale-invariant regime and so can allow
appreciable values for $dn_s/d\ln k$ as well as predicting a potentially

one is able to provide non-trivial quantitative checks of the AdS/CFT duality.
A string rotating in S^5 with two angular momenta J_1,J_2 is dual to an
operator in N=4 SYM theory whose conformal dimension can be computed by
diagonalizing a (generalization of) spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain Hamiltonian. It
was recently argued and verified to lowest order in a large J=J_1+J_2
expansion, that the Heisenberg chain can be described using a non-relativistic
low energy effective 2-d action for a unit vector field n_i which exactly
matches the corresponding large J limit of the classical AdS_5 x S^5 string
action. In this paper we show that this agreement extends to the next order and
develop a systematic procedure to compute higher orders in such large angular
momentum expansion. This involves several non-trivial steps. On the string
side, we need to choose a special gauge with a non-diagonal world-sheet metric
which insures that the angular momentum is uniformly distributed along the
string, as indeed is the case on the spin chain side. We need also to implement
an order by order redefinition of the field n_i to get an action linear in the
time derivative. On the spin chain side, it turns out to be crucial to include
the effects of integrating out short wave-length modes. In this way we gain a
better understanding of how (a subsector of) the string sigma model emerges
from the dual gauge theory, allowing us to demonstrate the duality beyond
comparing particular examples of states with large J.

divisibilty when censored in certain ways even if all moments are arbitrarily
close to those of the uncensored distribution. The moments of a composition of
k copies of $\mu$ are expressed as combinatorial compositions of the $\mu_n$.
We express the moments of the compositions in the context of occupancy
problems, arranging n balls in k cells; the classical convolution is described
by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and is multinomial. For certain non-infinitely
divisible measures with moments increasing fast enough the indexing of a k-cell
combinatorial composition is extended to indexing by non-negative real t and we
construct classical convolution measure semigroups from amongst the t-indexed
classes. We prove also that when a random variable with infinitely divisible
distribution is embedded in a L\'evy process $(Y_t)$ then the t-indexed
Maxwell-Boltzmann is the law of $Y_t$. In order to get moment-based multinomial
compositions indexed by a continuum we use random measures and random
distributions rather than random variables. An alternative approach to
embeddability of a non-infinitely divisible $\mu$ is by considering
non-classical convolution measure semigroups; for example embedding $\mu$ in a
Boolean convolution measure semigroup and retaining the multinomial character

exceed expectations from a model of equilibrated events with fluctuating global

remnants of initial-state semi-hard collisions. Lower-$p_t$ correlations
exhibit a saddle structure varying with centrality. Variations in the forms and
strengths of low and high $p_t$ correlations with centrality suggest transport
of semi-hard collision products into the lower $p_t$ region as a manifestation
of in-medium dissipation of minijets. Correlations on $p_t$ can be associated
with angular correlations on ($\eta$,$\phi$), using analysis methods (1), (2)
or (3). In particular, wavelet analysis (3) is performed in the ($\eta$,$\phi$)
space in bins of $p_t$ ($<2$ GeV/$c$). Observed angular correlation structures
include those attributed to quantum correlations and elliptic flow, as well as
a localized structure, increasing in amplitude with $p_t$, and presumed to
originate with minijets. That structure evolves with increasing centrality in a
way which also suggests dissipation, including an increased correlation length
on $\eta$ which may be related to the influence of a longitudinally expanding

0.8 V/pC. The output from the preamplifier is received by a shaper
(main-amplifier) with a gain of 7. A baseline restoration circuit is

restoration is 5-times smaller than that of the TGC-ASD. The threshold voltage
for the discriminator section is common to the 4 channels and their digital
output level is LVDS-compatible. The ASD IC also has an analog output of the
preamplifier. The equivalent noise charge at the input capacitance of 50 pF is
around 2000 electrons. The power dissipation with LVDS outputs (100 $\Omega$
load) is 57 mW/ch. Using this ASD, the analog output voltage from the signal of
the $\mu$-PIC is about 2-times higher than the case of using the TGC-ASD.As a

modulation within a slice of the electron bunch. Following the energy modulator
the electron beam enters the first part of the baseline gap-adjustable X-ray
undulator and produces SASE radiation with 100 MW-level power. Due to energy
modulation the frequency is correlated to the longitudinal position within the
few-cycle-driven slice of the SASE radiation pulse. The largest frequency
offset corresponds to a single-spike pulse in the time domain which is confined
to one half-oscillation period near the central peak electron energy. After the
first undulator the electron beam is guided through a magnetic delay which we
use to position the X-ray spike with the largest frequency offset at the
""fresh"" part of the electron bunch. After the chicane the electron beam and the
radiation produced in the first undulator enter the second undulator which is
resonant with the offset frequency. In the second undulator the seed radiation
at reference frequency plays no role, and only a single (300 as duration) spike
grows rapidly. The final part of the undulator is a tapered section allowing to
achieve maximum output power 100-150 GW in 0.15 nm wavelength range. Attosecond
X-ray pulse is naturally synchronized with its fs optical pulse which reveals
unique perspective for pump-probe experiments with sub-femtosecond resolution.

effective modeling of the quantum modular adder which is needed for Shor's and

near-resonant transitions with small detunings are completely suppressed, which
allows us to decrease errors by several orders of magnitude and to model a
1000-qubit full adder. (We add a 1000-bit number using 2001 spins.) (ii) We
construct the full adder gates directly as sequences of radio-frequency pulses,
rather than breaking them down into generalized logical gates, such as
Control-Not and one qubit gates. This substantially reduces the number of
pulses needed to implement the full adder. [The maximum number of pulses
required to add one bit (F-gate) is 15]. (iii) Full adder is realized in a
homogeneous spin chain. (iv) The phase error is minimized: the F-gates generate
approximately the same phase for different states of the superposition. (v)
Modeling of the full adder is performed using quantum maps instead of
differential equations. This allows us to reduce the calculation time to a
