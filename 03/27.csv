Hydrodynamics'' method. Realistic stellar structure models for evolved MS stars
were used. In order to sample an extended domain of initial parameters space
(masses of the stars, relative velocity and impact parameter), more than 15000
simulations were carried out. We considered stellar masses ranging between 0.1

computational burden, a resolution of 2000-30000 particles per star was used.
The primary goal of this study was to build a complete database from which the
result of any collision can be interpolated. This allows us to incorporate the
effects of stellar collisions with an unprecedented level of realism into
dynamical simulations of galactic nuclei and other dense stellar clusters. We
make the data describing the initial condition and outcome (mass and energy
loss, angle of deflection) of all our simulations freely available on the

stellar structure and that, in most cases, using polytropic models is
inappropriate. Published fitting formulas for the collision outcomes,
established from a limited set of collisions, prove of limited use because they
do not allow robust extrapolation to other stellar structures or relative

hadronic jet models to fit the observed broadband spectra and spectral
variability patterns. We start out with global spectral models. Subsequently,
we investigate various flaring scenarios for comparison with the observed
short-term variability. For our leptonic jet model, we find that the short-term
variability, in particular the optical and X-ray spectral variability, can be
best represented with a flaring scenario dominated by a spectral-index change
of the spectrum of ultrarelativistic electrons injected into the jet. Based on
this result, a detailed model simulation, reproducing the observed optical and
X-ray spectral variability and broadband SED of BL Lacertae simultaneously, is
presented. Our leptonic modeling results are compared to fits using the
hadronic synchrotron-proton blazar (SPB) model. That model can reproduce the
observed SEDs of BL Lacertae in a scenario with muon-synchrotron dominated
high-energy emission. It requires a significantly higher magnetic field than
the leptonic model (~ 40 G vs. ~ 2 G in the leptonic model) and a lower Doppler
factor associated with the bulk motion of the emission region (D ~ 8 vs. D ~ 18
in the leptonic model). The hadronic model predicts a significantly larger >
100 GeV flux than the leptonic models, well within the anticipated capabilities

properties of a sample of elliptical-like objects (ELOs) identified in four
hydrodynamical, self-consistent simulations run with the DEVA code (Serna et
al. 2003). Star formation has been implemented in the code through a simple
phenomenological parameterization, that takes into account stellar physics
processes only implicitly through the values of a threshold gas density,
$\rho_{\rm g,thres}$, and an efficiency parameter, $c_*$. The four simulations
operate in the context of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model consistent with
observations, resolve ELO mass assembly at scales up to $\simeq$ 2 kpc, and
differ in the values of their star formation parameters. Stellar masses,
projected half-mass radii and central l.o.s. velocity dispersions, $\sigma_{\rm
los, 0}$, have been measured on the ELO sample and their values compared with
data from the Sloan digital sky survey. For the first time in self-consistent
simulations, a good degree of agreement has been shown, including the
Faber-Jackson and the $D_n - \sigma_{\rm los, 0}$ relations, among others, but
only when particular values of the $\rho_{\rm g,thres}$ and $c_*$ parameters
are used. This demostrates the effect that the star formation parameterization
has on the ELO mass distribution. Additionally, our results suggest that it is
not strictly necessary, at the scales resolved in this work, to appeal to
energy sources other than gravitational (as for example supernovae feedback
effects) to account for the structure and kinematics of large ellipticals.

Specifically, we examine how the triaxiality of CDM halos affects the overall
lensing probabilities and the relative numbers of different image
configurations (double, quadruple, and naked cusp lenses). We find that
triaxiality significantly enhances lensing probabilities by a factor of ~2-4,
so it cannot be ignored. If CDM halos have central density slopes alpha<~1.5,
we predict that a significant fraction (>~20%) of large-separation lenses
should have naked cusp image configurations; this contrasts with lensing by
isothermal (\alpha~2) galaxies where naked cusp configurations are rare. The
image multiplicities depend strongly on the inner density slope \alpha: for
\alpha=1, the naked cusp fraction is >~60%; while for \alpha=1.5, quadruple
lenses are actually the most probable. Thus, the image multiplicities in
large-separation lenses offer a simple new probe of the inner density profiles
of dark matter halos. We also compute the expected probabilities and image
multiplicities for lensed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and argue
that the recent discovery of the large-separation quadruple lens SDSS

observed radial velocity variations are in anti-phase to the disk, the
absorption lines strengthen at mid-eclipse when the donor star is expected to
contribute its maximum percentage of the total flux, and the line widths are
consistent with lines created in an A supergiant photosphere. We discuss and
cast doubt on the possibility that these lines represent a shell spectrum

between 2000 October and 2003 May to cover its 2001 periastron passage. The WC7
+ O4-5 spectroscopic binary WR 140 is the prototype of colliding-wind, episodic
dust-making Wolf-Rayet systems which also show strong variations in radio and
X-ray emission. The JHK spectra showed changes in continuum and in the
equivalent widths of the WC emission lines, consistent with formation of dust
starting between 2001 January 3 and March 26 (orbital phases 0.989 and 0.017)
and its subsequent fading and cooling. The 1.083-micron He I line has a P-Cygni
profile which showed variations in both absorption and emission components as
WR 140 went through periastron passage. The variation of the absorption
component yielded tight constraints on the geometry of the wind-collision
region, giving theta = 50 +/- 8 degrees for the opening semi-angle of the
interaction `cone', indicating a wind-momentum ratio of the O to the WR
star=0.1, about three times larger than previously believed. As the system
approached periastron, the emission component showed the appearance of a
significant sub-peak, movement of which across the profile was seen to be
consistent with its formation in wind material flowing along the contact
discontinuity between the two stellar winds and the changing orientation of the
colliding wind region. The flux carried in the sub-peak exceeded the X-ray
fluxes measured at previous periastron passages. This additional source of
radiative cooling of the shock-heated gas probably causes it to depart from
being adiabatic around periastron passage, thereby accounting for the departure
of the X-ray flux from its previously expected $1/d$-dependency.

this natural evolution pattern the extra dimensions tend to be stabilized
automatically without resorting to artificial mechanisms in both the

building models with extra dimensions. In addition, the naturalness of this

the quantum creep of charges at zero temperature and the linear conductivity at

range interacting electrons acquires the same form as for noninteracting
particles if the one-particle density of states is replaced by the
compressibility. In the present paper we extend the calculation to dissipative
systems and give a discussion of the physics after the particles materialize
behind the tunneling barrier. It turns out that dissipation is crucial for
tunneling to happen. Contrary to pure systems the new metastable state does not
propagate through the system but is restricted to a region of the size of the
tunneling region. This corresponds to the hopping of an integer number of
charges over a finite distance. A global current results only if tunneling
events fill the whole sample. We argue that rare events of extra low tunneling
probability are not relevant for realistic systems of finite length. Finally we
show that an additional Coulomb interaction only leads to small logarithmic

function of intertrade times may be fit by a Weibull distribution; (ii) when
appropriately rescaled the probability densities of all companies collapse onto
a single curve implying a universal functional form; (iii) the intertrade times
exhibit power-law correlated behavior within a trading day and a consistently
greater degree of correlation over larger time scales, in agreement with the
correlation behavior of the absolute price returns for the corresponding
company, and (iv) the magnitude series of intertrade time increments is
characterized by long-range power-law correlations suggesting the presence of
nonlinear features in the trading dynamics, while the sign series is
anti-correlated at small scales. Our results suggest that independent of
industry sector, market capitalization and average level of trading activity,
the series of intertrade times exhibit possibly universal scaling patterns,
which may relate to a common mechanism underlying the trading dynamics of
diverse companies. Further, our observation of long-range power-law
correlations and a parallel with the crossover in the scaling of absolute price

of temperature. Two coherence peaks were observed in the sigma_1 versus
temperature curve at temperatures of ~0.5 Tc and ~0.9 Tc, respectively,
providing a direct evidence for the two-gap nature of MgB2. The film appeared
to have a pi-band gap energy of 1.8 meV. For the MgB2 film ion-milled down to

  Calculations based on the gap energies from the weak coupling
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and the strong coupling theory suggest that
both the sigma-band and the pi-band contribute to sigma_1 of the
polycrystalline MgB2 films significantly. Our results are in contrast with the
observation of single coherence peak at ~0.6 Tc and dominant role of the
pi-band in the microwave conductivity of c-axis oriented MgB2 films as reported
by Jin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 127006 (2003)].
  Variations in the inter-band coupling constants with the level of disorder
can account for the different Tc and sigma_1 behavior for the as-grown and

improve microwave properties of MgB2 filims at low temperatures due to the
larger pi-band gap despite the reduction of Tc.

quarks in these samples was based on the semileptonic decay channels b/c -> X +
mu and b/c -> X + e combined with charge flow information from the hemisphere
opposite to the lepton. Combining the A_{FB}^{b bbar} and A_{FB}^{c cbar}
measurements presented in this paper with published results based on 1991 and
1992 DELPHI data samples, the following pole asymmetries were obtained:
  A_{FB}^{0,b} = 0.1021 +/- 0.0052 (stat) +/- 0.0024 (syst)
  A_{FB}^{0,c} = 0.0728 +/- 0.0086 (stat) +/- 0.0063 (syst)
  The effective value of the weak mixing angle derived from these measurements
is sin^2 theta_{W,eff}^{lept} = 0.23170 +/- 0.00097 .

of late domination and the absence of damping of the perturbations pick out
essentially a unique candidate for the MSSM curvaton. One must also require
that inflation takes place in a hidden sector. If the inflaton energy density
can be radiated into extra dimensions, many constraints can be relaxed, and the
simplest flat direction consisting of the Higgses H_u and H_d would provide a
working example of an MSSM curvaton.

notion of a flag of subspaces in a vector space), and to give a geometric
realization of homogeneous spaces of the ind--groups $SL(\infty)$, $SO(\infty)$
and $Sp(\infty)$ in terms of generalized flags. Generalized flags in $V$ are
chains of subspaces which in general cannot be enumerated by integers. Given a
basis $E$ of $V$, we define a notion of $E$--commensurability for generalized
flags, and prove that the set $\cFl (\cF, E)$ of generalized flags
E$--commensurable with a fixed generalized flag $\cF$ in $V$ has a natural
structure of an ind--variety. In the case when $V$ is the standard
representation of $G = SL(\infty)$, all homogeneous ind--spaces $G/P$ for
parabolic subgroups $P$ containing a fixed splitting Cartan subgroup of $G$,
are of the form $\cFl (\cF, E)$. We also consider isotropic generalized flags.
The corresponding ind--spaces are homogeneous spaces for $SO(\infty)$ and
$Sp(\infty)$. As an application of the construction, we compute the Picard
group of $\cFl (\cF, E)$ (and of its isotropic analogs) and show that $\cFl

As a result the systematic behavior of the odd-even staggering effect and some
general characteristics of the spectrum such as the mutual disposition of the
bands, the interaction strength and the band structures is explained as the
manifestation of respective changes in collective dynamics of the system.

the string becomes elliptic as the amplitude of the vibration increases. The
fundamental resonance frequency depends on the amplitude of the vibration. At
sufficient high amplitudes the system exhibits hysterisis: the resonance
frequency is different when measured increasing the driving frequency or
decreasing it. The experimental results are well understood in the framework of
a 2-dimensional model assuming that the string tension is not constant due to
the varying length of the string throughout the oscillation.

is to decide which and how many genes should be selected for further studies.
For discriminant microarray data analyses based on statistical models, such as
the logistic regression models, gene selection can be accomplished by a
comparison of the maximum likelihood of the model given the real data,
$\hat{L}(D|M)$, and the expected maximum likelihood of the model given an
ensemble of surrogate data with randomly permuted label, $\hat{L}(D_0|M)$.
Typically, the computational burden for obtaining $\hat{L}(D_0|M)$ is immense,
often exceeding the limits of computing available resources by orders of
magnitude. Here, we propose an approach that circumvents such heavy
computations by mapping the simulation problem to an extreme-value problem. We
present the derivation of an asymptotic distribution of the extreme-value as
well as its mean, median, and variance. Using this distribution, we propose two
gene selection criteria, and we apply them to two microarray datasets and three
classification tasks for illustration.

different cells at different times, all from the same gene. In a cell that uses
alternative splicing, the total length of all the exons is much shorter than in
a cell that encodes the same set of proteins without alternative splicing. This
economical use of exons makes genes more stable during reproduction and
development because a genome with a shorter exon length is more resistant to
harmful mutations. Genomic stability may be the reason why higher vertebrates
splice alternatively. For a broad class of alternatively spliced genes, a
formula is given for the increase in their stability.

corresponds to a distinct ``patch''. A self-organizing hierarchical food web
describes the prey-predator relations in the eco-system. The same species at
different patches have identical food habits but differ from each other in
their reproductive characteristic features. By carrying out computer
simulations up to $10^9$ time steps, we found that, depending on the values of
the set of parameters, the distribution of the lifetimes of the species can be
either exponential or a combination of power laws. Some of the other features
of our ``unified'' model turn out to be robust against migration of the

either through simultaneous measurements of the chirality and particle
position, or as a result of broken links. Both mechanisms drive the system to a
classical diffusive behavior. In the case of measurements, we show that the
diffusion coefficient is proportional to the variance of the initially
localized quantum random walker just before the first measurement. When links
between neighboring sites are randomly broken with probability $p$ per unit
time, the evolution becomes decoherent after a characteristic time that scales
as $1/p$. The fact that the quadratic increase of the variance is eventually
lost even for very small frequencies of disrupting events, suggests that the
implementation of a quantum walk on a real physical system may be severely
limited by thermal noise and lattice imperfections.

"quant-ph/0403194","Docteur Peter Wolf","Peter Wolf, Christian J. Borde","Recoil Effects in Microwave Ramsey Spectroscopy","to be submitted to Phys. Rev. A",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a theory of recoil effects in two zone Ramsey spectroscopy,
particularly adapted to microwave frequency standards using laser cooled atoms.
We describe the atoms by a statistical distribution of Gaussian wave packets
which enables us to derive and quantify effects that are related to the
coherence properties of the atomic source and that have not been considered
previously. We show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the
expected recoil frequency shift can be partially cancelled by these effects
which can be significant at microwave wavelengths whilst negligible at optical
ones. We derive analytical expressions for the observed interference signal in
the weak field approximation, and numerical results for realistic caesium
fountain parameters. In the near future Cs and Rb fountain clocks are expected
to reach uncertainties which are of the same order of magnitude (10^{-16}) as
first estimates of the recoil shift at microwave frequencies. We show, however,
that the partial cancellation predicted by the complete theory presented here
leads to frequency shifts which are up to an order of magnitude smaller.
Nonetheless observation of the microwave recoil shift should be possible under
particular experimental conditions (increased microwave power, variation of
atomic temperature and launching height etc.). We hope that the present paper
can provide some guidance for such experiments that would test the underlying
theory and its assumptions, which in turn is essential for the next generation
of microwave frequency standards.
