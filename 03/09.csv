extended emitting region inside the galaxy well aligned with the radio
synchrotron jet-emission. The spectrum of the extended X-ray emission can best
be fitted with a thermal model with $kT = (0.4-0.5)$ keV, while the compact

The total ensemble is consistent with a phase that is constant over the

0.0102+/-0.0012 period in phase, or 344+/-40 us in time. The error estimate is
dominated by a systematic error of 40 us in the radio data, arising from
uncertainties in the variable amount of pulse delay due to interstellar
scattering and instrumental calibration. The statistical error is 0.00015

unchanging at time scales of a year or less, with an average value of
0.4001+/-0.0002 period. There is no apparent variation in these values with
energy over the 2-30 keV range. The lag between the radio and X-ray pulses may
be constant in phase (rotational) or constant in time (linear pathlength). We

the ionization and chemical equilibria of H, H+, H-, H2, H2+, and H3+ are
coupled with the equations of ionization and thermal balance for a photoionized
atomic gas. Forty different reactions related to the formation or the
destruction of these species are included. The presence of dust is taken into
account, since grains act as catalysts for the production of H2, as well as
shield the molecules against the stellar ionizing radiation. We analyze the
effect of the stellar ionizing continuum, as well as of the gas and grain
properties on the calculated H2 mass. It is shown that a significant
concentration of H2 can survive inside the ionized region of planetary nebulae,
mostly in the inner region of the recombination zone. The total H2 to total
hydrogen mass ratio inside the ionized region increases with the central star
temperature, and, depending on the PN physical conditions, it can be of the
order of 10^-6 or even higher. The increase of the recombination zone with the
stellar temperature can account for such correlation. This can explain why the
H2 emission is more frequently observed in bipolar planetary nebulae (Gatley's
rule), since this kind of object has typically hotter stars. Applying our
results for the planetary nebula NGC 6720, we obtain an H2 to hydrogen mass
ratio similar to the value obtained from the observed H2 line emission.

predicted the redshift of SMMJ16359+6612 to be z=2.6+/-0.4. We confirm this

z=2.516. SMMJ16359+6612 is the faintest submm-selected galaxy so far identified

seen in the NIRSPEC data, arguing for either a strong dust (lane) absorption or
a merger. Interestingly, there are 2 other highly-amplified galaxies at almost

key for the understanding of accreting X-ray pulsars -- the ability to
accumulate high quality spectra in a limited observing time. For the accreting
X-ray pulsars, with their relatively modest spin frequencies, this translates
into an ability to study broad band spectra as a function of pulse phase. This
is a critical tool, as pulsar spectra are strong functions of the geometry of
the ""accretion mound"" and the observers' viewing angle to the ~10^12 G magnetic

important, as they give us our only direct measure of neutron star magnetic
fields. Furthermore, they carry a great deal of information as to the geometry
and physical conditions in the accretion mound. In this paper, we review the

natural solutions to the horizon, flatness, and lambda problems, (2) the

over million years old if the effect of magnetic inclination angle as well as
the average properties of the outer gap are considered. The mature $\gamma$-ray
pulsars, whose ages are between 0.3 to 3 million years old, are able to move up
to high galactic latitude. Moreover, their $\gamma$-ray luminosity are weaker
and their spectra are softer than those of younger $\gamma$-ray pulsars in the
galactic plane significantly. We use a Monte Carlo method to simulate the
statistical properties of $\gamma$-ray pulsars in the Galaxy as well as in the
Gould Belt. We find that $\gamma$-ray pulsars located at $\mid b \mid <
5^{\circ}$ and located at $\mid b \mid > 5^{\circ}$ have very different
properties. High galactic latitude $\gamma$-ray pulsars are dominated by mature
pulsars with longer periods, weaker fluxes and softer spectra. If the pulsar
birth rate in the Galaxy and the Gould Belt are $\sim 10^{-2}yr^{-1}$ and $\sim
2\times 10^{-5}yr^{-1}$ respectively, there are 42 and 35 radio-quiet
$\gamma$-ray pulsars for $\mid b \mid < 5^{\circ}$ and $\mid b \mid >
5^{\circ}$ respectively. Radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsars from the Gould Belt
are 2 and 13 for $\mid b \mid < 5^{\circ}$ and $\mid b \mid > 5^{\circ}$
respectively. We suggest that a good fraction of unidentified EGRET
$\gamma$-ray sources may be these radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsars. Furthermore
$\gamma$-ray pulsars located at $\mid b \mid > 5^{\circ}$ satisfies $L_{\gamma}
\propto L^{\beta}_{sd}$ whereas $L_{\gamma} \propto L^{\delta}_{sd}$ for
$\gamma$-ray pulsars in the galactic plane, where $\beta \sim 0.6$ and $\delta
\sim 0.3$ respectively.

  Understanding Evolution of Cataclysmic Variable Stars",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  We report extensive photometry of frequently outbursting dwarf nova IX
Draconis. During five months of observations the star went into three
superoutbursts and seven ordinary outbursts. This allowed us to determine its
supercycle and cycle lengths as equal to 54 +/- 1 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 days,
respectively. During the Sep 2003 superoutburst, which had the best
observational coverage, IX Dra displayed clear superhumps with a period of
Psh=0.066968(17) days. This period was constant during the whole superoutburst.
Another period, which was clearly present in the light curve of IX Dra in
superoutburst, had a value of 0.06646(6) days and we interpret it as the
orbital period of the binary. Thus IX Dra is the first SU UMa star showing
orbital modulation during the entire superoutburst. The beat between these two
periods is the main cause of an unusual phase reversal of superhumps - a
phenomenon which was previously observed in ER UMa. If our interpretation of
the second periodicity is correct, IX Dra has an extremely low period excess
$\epsilon$ equal to only 0.76% +/- 0.03%. This implies very low mass ratio
q=0.035 +/- 0.003, which strongly suggests that the system contains a brown
dwarf-like degenerate secondary of mass ~0.03 Mo and that IX Dra is the most
evolved dwarf nova known. Such a very low mass ratio results in the outer edge
of the accretion disk reaching 80% of the distance between the components of
the system. In turn, this allows the disk particles to enter a 2:1 resonance
and leads to the appearance of the orbital period in the light curve of the
entire superoutburst.The high level of activity and brightness of IX Dra
indicate that very old cataclysmic variables go through episodes of increased
activity leading to loss of angular momentum through mass loss from the system.

this fact as another indication for illumination of a distant and cold material

moving through narrow pores are solved for a number of one-dimensional models
of single ion transport. Ions move through pores of length $L$, under the
action of a constant external field and of a concentration gradient. The
interaction of single ions with the confining pore surface and with water
molecules inside the pore are modelled by a Fokker-Planck term in the kinetic
equation, or by uncorrelated collisions with thermalizing centres distributed
along the pore. The temporary binding of ions to polar residues lining the pore
is modelled by stopping traps or energy barriers. Analytic expressions for the
stationary ion current through the pore are derived for several versions of the
model, as functions of key physical parameters. In all cases, saturation of the
current at high fields is predicted. Such simple models, for which results are
analytic, may prove useful in the study of the current/voltage relations of ion

into the rotating frame of reference for the spin dynamics. The ferromagnetic
damping in this case grows linearly with the spin-flip rate when the latter is
smaller than the exchange field and is inversely proportional to the spin-flip
rate in the opposite limit. These two regimes are analogous to the

magnetization can be efficiently relaxed to the itinerant-carrier degrees of
freedom due to the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence bands.

with a periodicity of 2.8A, and a third having a periodicity that is about 10%
larger (3.1A). The subtle difference in the atomic periodicities between the
three areas results from the modulation of intrinsic strain developed along the
surface. The superstructure results from electronic effects rather than being a
mosaic of different iron oxide terminations. The onset of the superstructure is
sensitive to the surface stoichiometry. From our results we could estimate the
critical density of defects leading to the disappearance of the superstructure.
We have modelled the experimental results and calculated the electron density
using a DFT algorithm. The model clearly shows the development of strain along
the surface.

``kernel'', then the obtained weighting factors at each \mc step from the \clsq
method builds up a relaxation time spectrum. When the analysis is repeated for

obtained relaxation are analyzed using the Lorentz (Cauchy) distribution, which

relaxations to those earlier reported in the literature indicate that the

empirical formulas. The distribution of relaxation times analysis is especially
useful to probe the crossover region where the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-
relaxations merge and the results show that the relaxation after the crossover
region at higher temperatures is Arrhenius-type as the $\beta$-relaxation.
Moreover, this relaxation is more likely to be the continuation of the

an optimal evaluation strategy which constitutes the basis of modern

fundamentals of partial evaluation in such languages. We provide correctness
results for partial evaluation based on needed narrowing and show that the nice
properties of this strategy are essential for the specialization process. In
particular, the structure of the original program is preserved by partial
evaluation and, thus, the same evaluation strategy can be applied for the
execution of specialized programs. This is in contrast to other partial
evaluation schemes for lazy functional logic programs which may change the
program structure in a negative way. Recent proposals for the partial

it has been well established that the removal of the center vortices from the
lattice configurations results in the loss of confinement. The running coupling
constant, the gluon and the ghost form factors are studied in Landau gauge for
both cases, the full and the vortex removed theory. In the latter case, a
strong suppression of the running coupling constant and the gluon form factor
at low momenta is observed. At the same time, the singularity of the ghost form
factor at vanishing momentum disappears. This observation establishes an
intimate correlation between the ghost singularity and confinement. The result
also shows that a removal of the vortices generates a theory for which
Zwanziger's horizon condition for confinement is no longer satisfied.

out that there was a discrepancy in previous discussions. The expected tension
of the cosmic string calculated from the four-dimensional effective Lagrangian
did not match the one obtained in the brane analysis. In the previous analysis,
the cosmic string is assumed to correspond to the lower-dimensional daughter
brane, which wraps the same compactified space as the original mother brane. In
this case, however, the tension of the daughter brane cannot depend on the
angle (\theta). On the other hand, from the analysis of the effective
Lagrangian for tachyon condensation, it is easy to see that the tension of the
cosmic string must be proportional to \theta, when \theta << 1. This is an
obvious discrepancy that must be explained by consideration of the explicit
brane dynamics. In this paper, we will solve this problem by introducing a
simple idea. We calculate the tension of the string in the two cases, which
matches precisely. The cosmological constraint for angled inflation is relaxed,
because the expected tension of the cosmic string becomes smaller than the one
obtained in previous arguments, by a factor of \theta.

un-excited color flux tubes between the five quarks bind them into a stable and
narrow color-singlet. Such a configuration allows the lowest state having the
negative parity naturally. The decay of the $\Theta_5$ pentaquark into the
nucleon and kaon requires the breakup of the non-planar diamond configuration
into two conventional planar hadrons, which involves some kind of structural
phase transition as in the condensed matter physics. Hence the width of the

strength tensor is $H_{LMN}$), which appears in the massless sector of a
heterotic string theory, is assumed to coexist with the gravity in the bulk.
The third rank field strength corresponding to the Kalb-Ramond field has a
well-known geometric interpretation as the spacetime torsion. The only
non-trivial classical solutions corresponding to the effective four-dimensional
action are found to be self-dual or anti-selfdual Kalb-Ramond fields. This
ensures that the four-dimensional effective action on the brane is
parity-conserving. The massive modes for both cases, lying in the TeV range,
are related to the fundamental parameters of the theory. These modes can be
within the kinematic reach of forthcoming TeV scale experiments. However, the
couplings of the massless as well as massive Kalb-Ramond modes with matter on
the visible brane are found to be suppressed vis-a-vis that of the graviton by
the warp factor, whence the conclusion is that both the massless and the
massive torsion modes appear much weaker than curvature to an observer on the

in any way that is based upon the braiding of V. The exception that they
mention is the case in which V is symmetric, which leads to V-Cat being
symmetric as well. The symmetry in V-Cat is based upon the symmetry of V. The
motivation behind this paper is in part to describe how these facts relating V
and V-Cat are in turn related to a categorical analogue of topological
delooping. To do so I need to pass to a more general setting than braided and
symmetric categories -- in fact the k-fold monoidal categories of Balteanu et
al in [Iterated Monoidal Categories, Adv. Math. 176(2003) 277-349]. It seems
that the analogy of loop spaces is a good guide for how to define the concept
of enrichment over various types of monoidal objects, including k-fold monoidal
categories and their higher dimensional counterparts. The main result is that
for V a k-fold monoidal category, V-Cat becomes a (k-1)-fold monoidal
2-category in a canonical way. In the next paper I indicate how this process
may be iterated by enriching over V-Cat, along the way defining the 3-category
of categories enriched over V-Cat. In future work I plan to make precise the
n-dimensional case and to show how the group completion of the nerve of V is
related to the loop space of the group completion of the nerve of V-Cat.

scrutiny of time-dependent flows, highly non-linear in nature. Often this
motion is self-similar in nature, such that it can in fact be mapped onto a
pseudo-stationary problem, amenable to mathematical analysis.

"quant-ph/0403065","David Pearson","David Pearson and Chip Elliott","On the Optimal Mean Photon Number for Quantum Cryptography","19 pages, 4 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The optimal mean photon number (mu) for quantum cryptography is the average
photon number per transmitted pulse that results in the highest delivery rate
of distilled cryptographic key bits, given a specific system scenario and set
of assumptions about Eve's capabilities. Although many experimental systems
have employed a mean photon number (mu) of 0.1 in practice, several research
teams have pointed out that this value is somewhat arbitrary. In fact, various
optimal values for mu have been described in the literature.
  In this paper we offer a detailed analytic model for an experimental,
fiber-based quantum cryptographic system, and an explicit set of reasonable
assumptions about Eve's current technical capabilities. We explicitly model
total system behavior ranging from physical effects to the results of quantum
cryptographic protocols such as error correction and privacy amplification. We
then derive the optimal photon number (mu) for this system in a range of
scenarios. One interesting result is that mu of approximately 1.1 is optimal
for a wide range of realistic, fiber-based QKD systems; in fact, it provides
nearly 10 times the distilled throughput of systems that employ a more
conventional mu = 0.1, without any adverse affect on system security, as judged
against a set of reasonable assumptions about Eve's current capabilities.

semi-infinite lines to a general finite graph, which we call tails. On the
tails, the particle making the walk simply advances one unit at each time step,
so that its behavior there is analogous to free propagation We are interested
in how many steps it will take the particle, starting on one tail and
propagating through the graph (where its propagation is not free), to emerge
onto the other tail. The probability to make such a walk in n steps and the
hitting time for such a walk can be expressed in terms of the transmission
amplitude for the graph, which is one element of its S matrix. Demonstrating
this necessitates a study of the analyticity properties of the transmission and
reflection amplitudes of a graph. We show that the graph can have bound states
that cannot be accessed by a particle entering the graph from one of its tails.
Time-reversal invariance of a quantum walk is defined and used to show that the
transmission amplitudes for the particle entering the graph from different
directions are the same if the walk is time-reversal invariant.

quantum states as a new cryptographic problem to design a quantum cryptographic
scheme that is ""secure"" against any polynomial-time quantum adversary. Our
problem, QSCDff, is to distinguish between two types of random coset states
with a hidden permutation over the symmetric group of finite degree. This
naturally generalizes the commonly-used distinction problem between two
probability distributions in computational cryptography. As our major
contribution, we show that QSCDff has three properties of cryptographic
interest: (i) QSCDff has a trapdoor; (ii) the average-case hardness of QSCDff
coincides with its worst-case hardness; and (iii) QSCDff is computationally at
least as hard as the graph automorphism problem in the worst case. These
cryptographic properties enable us to construct a quantum public-key
cryptosystem, which is likely to withstand any chosen plaintext attack of a
polynomial-time quantum adversary. We further discuss a generalization of
QSCDff, called QSCDcyc, and introduce a multi-bit encryption scheme that relies
on similar cryptographic properties of QSCDcyc.

the framework of unitary evolution. A canonical one-form is defined whose line
integral gives the geometric phase which is gauge invariant. It reduces to the
Aharonov and Anandan phase in the pure state case. Our definition is consistent
with the phase shift in the proposed experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{85},

parallel transport condition. A comprehensive geometric interpretation is also
given. It shows that the geometric phases for mixed states share the same
geometric sense with the pure states.

quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) provides a suitable replacement for the
regular QFT in many quantum algorithms. Since the AQFT is less accurate by
definition, polynomially many more applications of the AQFT are required to
achieve the original accuracy. However, in many quantum algorithms, the smaller
size of the AQFT circuit yields a net improvement over using the QFT.
  This paper presents a more thorough analysis of the AQFT circuit, which leads
to the surprising conclusion that for sufficiently large input sizes, the
difference between the QFT and the logarithmic-depth AQFT is negligible. In
effect, the AQFT can be used as an direct replacement for the QFT, yielding
improvements in any application which does not require exact quantum
computation.
