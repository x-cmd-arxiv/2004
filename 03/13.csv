of the cosmologically recent accelerated expansion of the Universe and of the
evolution of energy density perturbations. This dark energy - dark matter
unification is achieved through a rather exotic background fluid whose equation
of state is given by $p = - A/\rho^{\alpha}$, where $A$ is a positive constant.
Observational constraints arising from bounds on the locations of the first few
peaks and troughs of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) power
spectrum from recent WMAP and BOOMERanG experiments are consistent with the
model for $\alpha \lsim 0.6$ assuming that $0 < \alpha \le 1$. Most recent
Type-Ia Supernova data indicates however, that the range $\alpha > 1 $ must be
considered.

oxygen rich AGB stars. The study is based on a sample of 30 sources distributed
along the IRAS colour-colour diagram. The sources were chosen to trace the
Miras with thick shells and the whole range of OH/IR stars. The Miras exhibit a
1665 MHz emission strength comparable to that at 1667 MHz. Even though the
Miras of the study have quite thick shells, their spectral characteristics in
both main lines attest to a strong heterogeneity in their OH shell with, in
particular, the presence of significant turbulence and acceleration. The
expansion velocity has been found to be about the same at 1665 and 1667 MHz,
taking into account a possible velocity turbulence of 1-2km/s at the location
of the main-line maser emission. An increase in the intensity ratio 1667/1665
with shell thickness has been found. A plausible explanation for such a
phenomenon is that competitive gain in favour of the 1667 MHz line increases
when the shell is getting thicker. There is an evolution in the spectral
profile shape with the appearance of a substantial inter-peak signal when the
shell is getting thicker. Also, inter-peak components are found and can be as
strong as the external standard peaks when the shell is very thick. This trend
for an increase of the signal in between the two main peaks is thought to be
the result of an increase of the saturation with shell thickness. All sources
but two - a Mira and an OH/IR star from the lower part of the colour-colour
diagram - are weakly polarized. The strong polarization observed for those two
particular objects is thought to be the result of perturbations in their
shells.

(rms) by nearly a factor of two, compared to the original data. The POSS I
magnitudes can be improved to ~0.15 mag accuracy, and POSS II magnitudes to
\~0.10 mag accuracy. We use the recalibrated catalogs for the ~2,000 deg2 of

variable on time scales 10-50 years. A series of statistical tests based on the
morphology of SDSS color-color diagrams, as well as visual comparison of images
and comparison with repeated SDSS observations, demonstrate the robustness of
the selection methods. We quantify the distribution of variable sources in the
SDSS color-color diagrams, and the variability characteristics of quasars. We
detect a turn-over in quasar structure function which suggests that the
characteristic time scale for quasar variability is of the order one year. The
long-term (>1 year) quasar variability decreases with luminosity and rest-frame
wavelength similarly to the short-term (<1 year) behavior. We also demonstrate
that candidate RR Lyrae stars trace the same halo structures, such as the Sgr
dwarf tidal stream, that were discovered using repeated SDSS observations. We
utilize the POSS-SDSS selected candidates to constrain the halo structure in
the parts of sky for which repeated SDSS observations do not exist. (abridged)

active galaxies, and BL Lac objects shows highly collimated relativistic motion
with apparent transverse velocities typically between zero and about 15c, with
a tail extending up to about 34c. Within individual jets, different features
appear to move with a similar characteristic velocity which may represent an
underlying continuous jet flow, but we also see some stationary and even
apparently inward moving features which co-exist with the main features.
Comparison of our observations with published data at other wavelengths
suggests that there is a systematic decrease in apparent velocity with
increasing wavelength, probably because the observations at different
wavelengths sample different parts of the jet structure. The observed
distribution of linear velocities is not consistent with any simple ballistic
model. Either there is a rather broad range of Lorentz factors, a significant
difference between the velocity of the bulk relativistic flow and the pattern
speed of underlying shocks, or a combination of these options. Assuming a
ballistic flow, comparison of observed apparent velocities and Doppler factors
computed from the time scale of flux density variations is consistent with a
steep power law distribution of intrinsic Lorentz factors, an isotropic
distribution of orientations of the parent population, and intrinsic brightness
temperatures about an order of magnitude below the canonical inverse Compton
limit. It appears that the parent population of radio jets is not dominated by
highly relativistic flows (abridged).

The first part of this paper focusses on issues pertaining to dark matter
including observational evidence for its existence, current constraints and the
`abundance of substructure' and `cuspy core' issues which arise in CDM. I also
briefly describe MOND. The second part of this review focusses on dark energy.
In this part I discuss the significance of the cosmological constant problem
which leads to a predicted value of the cosmological constant which is almost
$10^{123}$ times larger than the observed value $\la/8\pi G \simeq
10^{-47}$GeV$^4$. Setting $\la$ to this small value ensures that the
acceleration of the universe is a fairly recent phenomenon giving rise to the
`cosmic coincidence' conundrum according to which we live during a special
epoch when the density in matter and $\la$ are almost equal. Anthropic
arguments are briefly discussed but more emphasis is placed upon dynamical dark
energy models in which the equation of state is time dependent. These include
Quintessence, Braneworld models, Chaplygin gas and Phantom energy. Model
independent methods to determine the cosmic equation of state and the
Statefinder diagnostic are also discussed. The Statefinder has the attractive
property $\atridot/a H^3 = 1 $ for LCDM, which is helpful for differentiating
between LCDM and rival dark energy models. The review ends with a brief
discussion of the fate of the universe in dark energy models.

using analytical and numerical methods. We study perturbatively the ground
state phase space for weak interactions, and find that in an anharmonic trap
the rotational ground states are vortex or center of mass rotational states;
the crossover line separating these two phases is calculated. We further show
that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a valid description of such a gas in the
rotating frame and calculate numerically the phase space structure using this
equation. It is found that the transition between vortex and center of mass
rotation is gradual; furthermore the perturbative approach is valid only in an
exceedingly small portion of phase space. We also present an intuitive picture
of the physics involved in terms of correlated successive measurements for the
center of mass state.

much lower hyperfine field with considerable broadening and quadrupole features

result, the time-dependent upper bound leads us to choose naturally a set of

dominated by the paradigm that nature is basically translation invariant.
Deviations from translation invariance are described by the action of forces.
General relativity is based on a different paradigm: There is no translation
invariance in general. Interaction is a consequence of the geometry of
spacetime, formed by the presence of matter, rather than of forces.
  In recent years the formation of spacetime on a quantum mechanical level, has
been intensively studied within the framework of spin foams, following an old
idea from R. Penrose. In this connection it would be appropriate to reconsider
the meaning of those paradigms and attempt to apply the paradigm of general
relativity to particle physics.
  A spin foam model with underlying SO(3,2) symmetry is well-suited for this
purpose. It represents a purely geometric model in the sense of the second
paradigm. By applying perturbative methods, starting from a translation
invariant first approximation, this model is reformulated in the sense of the
first paradigm. It will be shown that the model then defines a spacetime
manifold equipped with a particle theory in the form of locally interacting
quantized fields. This includes all four types of interaction: electromagnetic,
weak, chromodynamics and gravitation together with realistic numerical values
of the corresponding coupling constants.

is drastically affected by the dynamic reorganization of inter- and intra-

freedom [Cina et. al, J. Chem Phys. {118}, 46 (2003)]. The dynamics of the
electronic population and nuclear coherence is analyzed by solving the chain of
coupled differential equations for %mean coordinate, population inversion,
electron-vibrational correlation, etc. [Prezhdo, Pereverzev, J. Chem. Phys.
{113} 6557 (2000)]. Intriguing results are obtained in the approximation of a
small change of the nuclear equilibrium upon photoexcitation. In the limiting
case of resonance between the electronic energy gap and the frequency of the
nuclear mode these results are justified by comparison to the exactly solvable
Jaynes-Cummings model. It is found that the photoinduced processes in the model
dimer are arranged according to their time scales: (i) fast scale of nuclear
motion, (ii) intermediate scale of dynamical redistribution of electronic
population between excited states as well as growth and dynamics of
electron-nuclear correlation, (iii) slow scale of electronic population
approach to the quasi-equilibrium distribution, decay of electron-nuclear
correlation, and decrease of the amplitude of mean coordinate oscillation. The
latter processes are accompanied by a noticeable growth of the nuclear
coordinate dispersion associated with the overall nuclear wavepacket width. The
demonstrated quantum relaxation features of the photoinduced vibronic dynamics
in molecular dimers are obtained by a simple method, applicable to systems with

be the set of its vertices. Denote the adjacency matrix of T(d,h) by A and
consider the modified Laplacian matrix D:=dI-A. Let the rows of D span the
