inhomogeneities of any light scalars. Assuming the coupling constants at the
time of inflation depend on some light moduli fields, we encounter the
generation of modulated cosmological fluctuations from (p)reheating. This is an
alternative mechanism to generate observable (almost) scale free adiabatic
metric perturbations. We extend this idea to the class of hybrid inflation,
where the bifurcation value of the inflaton is modulated by the spatial
inhomogeneities of the couplings. As a result, the symmetry breaking after
inflation occurs not simultaneously in space but with the time laps in
different Hubble patches inherited from the long-wavelength moduli
inhomogeneities. To calculate modulated fluctuations we introduce techniques of
general relativistic matching conditions for metric perturbations at the time
hypersurface where the equation of state after inflation undergoes a jump,
without evoking the detailed microscopic physics, as far as it justifies the
jump. We apply this theory to the modulated fluctuations from the hybrid and
chaotic inflations. We discuss what distinguish the modulated from the
inflation-driven fluctuations, in particular, their spectral index,
modification of the consistency relation and the issue of weak non-Gaussianity.

the gravitational lensing cluster A1835. If this detection is confirmed and the
detection rate turns out to be typical, then the volume averaged ultraviolet
emissivity must be rising rapidly with increasing redshift. For a magnification
due to gravitational lensing by a factor M>25 estimated by Pell'o et al., the
inferred star formation rate density at z=10 would be about one order of
magnitude higher than estimates of the star formation rate density at z=6.
Objects at z=10 would contribute substantially to the total source counts at
1.6 micronm and the estimated space density of sources may exceed the space
density of dark matter haloes in a LCDM model. We therefore argue that if
A1835#1916 is indeed at z=10 then either the magnification factor may have been
overestimated or the galaxy has a top-heavy initial mass function. Sources with
the ultraviolet flux and space density of A1835#1916 may be sufficient to
reionise most of the diffuse hydrogen in the Universe at z=10. We further use a
correlation between the equivalent width and the redshift of the Ly-alpha
emission line with respect to the systemic redshift observed in Lyman break
galaxies to obtain constraints on the ionisation state of the surrounding
intergalactic medium (IGM) from the Gunn-Peterson absorption. These constraints
also argue in favour of the surrounding IGM being partially or fully ionised.

0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), believed to be the product of a
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The remnant is very round in shape, with a distinct
clumpy shell-like structure. Our Chandra data reveal the remnant to be rich in
silicon, sulfur, and iron. The yields of our fits to the global spectrum
confirm that 0509-67.5 is the remnant of an SN Ia and show a clear preference
for delayed detonation explosion models for SNe Ia. We study the spectrum of
the single brightest isolated knot in the remnant and find that it is enhanced
in iron by a factor of roughly two relative to the global remnant abundances.
This feature, along with similar knots seen in Tycho's SNR, argues for the
presence of modest small-scale composition inhomogeneities in SNe Ia. The
presence of both Si and Fe, with abundance ratios that vary from knot to knot,
indicates that these came from the transition region between the Si- and
Fe-rich zones in the exploded star, possibly as a result of energy input to the
ejecta at late times due to the radioactive decay of 56Ni and 56Co. Two cases
for the continuum emission from the global spectrum were modeled: one where the
continuum is dominated by hydrogen thermal bremsstrahlung radiation; another
where the continuum arises from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The former
case requires a relatively large value for the ambient density (~1 cm^-3).
Another estimate of the ambient density comes from using the shell structure of
the remnant in the context of dynamical models. This requires a much lower
value for the density (<0.05 cm^-3) which is more consistent with other
evidence known about 0509-67.5. We therefore conclude that the bulk of the
continuum emission from 0509-67.5 has a non-thermal origin.

been generated by a mean field dynamo. In order to have generated the fields
observed, the dynamo would have had to have operated for a sufficiently long
period of time. However, magnetic fields of similar intensities and scales to
the one in our galaxy, are observed in high redshift galaxies, where a mean
field dynamo would not have had enough time to produce the observed fields.
Instead of a mean field dynamo, we study the emergence of strong large scale
magnetic fields in the first objects formed in the universe due to the action
or a turbulent, helical stochastic dynamo, for redshifts $5 \leq z \leq 10$.
Ambipolar drift plays an important role in this process due to the low level of
ionization of the gas, allowing a large scale stochastic dynamo to operate. We
take into account the uncertainties in the physics of high redshift objects by
examining a range of values for the parameters that characterize the turbulent
plasma. By numerically integrating the nonlinear evolution equations for the
magnetic field correlations, we show that for reasonable values of the
parameters in the time interval considered, fields can grow to high intensities
($\sim 10^{-6}$ G), with large coherence lengths ($\sim 2-6$ kpc), essentially

hole with a spin axis that is tilted (not aligned) with the angular momentum
vector of the disk. We initialize the problem with the solution for an aligned,
constant angular momentum, accreting thick disk, which is then allowed to
respond to the Lense-Thirring precession of the tilted black hole. The
precession causes the disk to warp, beginning at the inner edge and moving out
on roughly the Lense-Thirring precession timescale. The propagation of the warp
stops at a radius in the disk at which other dynamical timescales, primarily
the azimuthal sound-crossing time, become shorter than the precession time. At
this point, the warp effectively freezes into the disk and the evolution
becomes quasi-static, except in cases where the sound-crossing time in the bulk
of the disk is shorter than the local precession timescale. We see evidence
that such disks undergo near solid-body precession after the initial warping
has frozen in. Simultaneous to the warping of the disk, there is also a
tendency for the midplane to align with the symmetry plane of the black hole
due to the preferential accretion of the most tilted disk gas. This alignment
is not as pronounced, however, as it would be if more efficient angular
momentum transport (e.g. from viscosity or magneto-rotational instability) were

stars. Of all these mechanisms, the only one giving satisfactory results is the
passage of a star. Indeed, our simulations show that the passage of a solar
mass star at about 800 AU only perturbs objects with semi-major axes larger
than roughly 200 AU to large perihelion distances. This is in good agreement
with the fact that 2000 CR105 has a semi-major axis of 230AU and no other
bodies with similar perihelion distances but smaller semi-major axes have yet
been discovered. The discovery of 2003 VB12, (a=450AU, q=75AU) announced a few
days before the submission of this paper, strengthen our conclusions.

Due to the low metallicity, the stars are allowed to form with large initial

metallicity, therefore, may lead to the formation of massive remnants. In
particular, black holes of intermediate-mass (100-500 Msun) are expected to
have formed in early Universe, in contrast to the much lower mass stellar black
holes (10 Msun) being formed at present. Following a natural assumption, that
some of these Population III stars have formed in binaries, the physical
properties of first stellar binary black holes are presented. We find that a
significant fraction of such binary black holes coalesces within the Hubble

coalescences and the following ringdown of these binary black hole mergers can
be observed in the interferometric detectors. We estimate that advanced LIGO

powerful high-redshift radio sources observed previously in the submillimetre,
these radio sources are typical of those dominating the radio luminosity
density of the population. We detect just two of the TOOT/7CRS targets at 850
microns, and one of these detections is probably due to synchrotron emission
rather than dust. The population represented by the other six objects is
detected in a statistical sense with their average 850-micron flux density
implying that they are similar to low-redshift, far-infrared-luminous quasars
undergoing at most moderate (< 200 solar masses per year) starbursts. By
considering all the SCUBA data available for radio sources, we conclude that
positive correlations between rest-frame far-infrared luminosity, 151-MHz
luminosity and redshift, although likely to be present, are hard to interpret
because of subtle selection and classification biases, small number statistics
and uncertainties concerning synchrotron contamination and K-correction. We

escape mechanism at intermediate temperatures at which the exobase reaches the
Roche lobe. From an energy balance, we can estimate plausible values for the
planetary exospheric temperatures, and thus obtain typical life times of

mapping reveals that this difference is almost entirely due to the changes in
the accretion disc radius: from ~0.5RL1 in the intermediate state to ~0.75RL1
in the high state (RL1 is the distance from the white dwarf to the first
Lagrangian point). In the intermediate state, the entire disc is eclipsed while
in the high state, its outer part remains visible. We also find that the
central intensity of the disc is nearly the same in the two luminosity states

final rise from the 1999/2000 low state. We find that the intensity profile of
the disc is rather flat and suggest a possible explanation. We also discuss the

long as the neutron stars are not too massive relative to the black hole mass,

the stable transfer ends before the minimum neutron star mass is reached. For a
strange star, mass transfer does not result in an appreciable enlargement of
the orbital separation, and the stable transfer continues until the strange

modulations in underdoped cuprates via scanning tunelling microscopy. These

to such an order will induce modulations at the same ordering wavevector. Such
modulations are a signature of the real or incipient order. We construct ground
state wavefunctions that include strong fluctuations of the competing order
without having ordered. They exhibit deep roton minima at wavevectors of the
reciprocal lattice of the incipient order due to proximity to the phase
transition into the charge ordered state. Such minima, in turn, produce strong
modulations. Moreover, the effects are generic and are present whenever an
electronic system is near a crystalline phase. This leads to experimental
signatures even if the electronic system has not solidified. The signatures
will be ubiquitous near the dopings that stabilize the electronic order.

dealing with these dynamical phenomena, we analyze the dynamical stability of a
front between vortices and antivortices. In particular we focus on the question
of whether an instability of the vortex front can occur in the absence of a
coupling to the temperature. Borrowing ideas developed for singular bacterial
growth fronts, we perform an explicit linear stability analysis which shows
that, for sufficiently large front velocities and in the absence of coupling to

anisotropy. This result differs from previous conclusions drawn on the basis of
approximate calculations for stationary fronts. As our method extends to more
complicated models, which could include coupling to the temperature or to other

the hole concentration on the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature in the quantum conductance
staircase of the quantum wire prepared inside the p-type silicon quantum well
using the split-gate technique. The 1D channel is demonstrated to be
spin-polarized at the linear concentration of holes lower than the critical
linear concentration, because the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature is close to the value of
0.5 (2e2/h) that indicates the spin degeneracy lifting for the first step of
the quantum conductance staircase. The 0.7 (2e2/h) feature is found to take
however its normal magnitude when the linear concentration of holes attains the
critical value corresponding to the spin depolarization. The variations in the
height of the 0.7 (2e2/h) feature observed in the hole quantum conductance
staircase that is revealed by the p-type silicon quantum wire seem to be
related to the evidences of the quantum conductance staircase obtained by
varying the concentration of electrons in the 1D channel prepared inside the
GaAs-AlGaAs heterojunction.

stochastic dependence of categorical random variables. In order to address
questions such as the reliability of the descriptive value, one must consider
sample-to-population inferential approaches. This paper deals with the
posterior distribution of mutual information, as obtained in a Bayesian
framework by a second-order Dirichlet prior distribution. The exact analytical
expression for the mean, and analytical approximations for the variance,
skewness and kurtosis are derived. These approximations have a guaranteed
accuracy level of the order O(1/n^3), where n is the sample size. Leading order
approximations for the mean and the variance are derived in the case of
incomplete samples. The derived analytical expressions allow the distribution
of mutual information to be approximated reliably and quickly. In fact, the
derived expressions can be computed with the same order of complexity needed
for descriptive mutual information. This makes the distribution of mutual
information become a concrete alternative to descriptive mutual information in
many applications which would benefit from moving to the inductive side. Some
of these prospective applications are discussed, and one of them, namely
feature selection, is shown to perform significantly better when inductive
mutual information is used.

have reached substantial levels of maturity. Each of these two disciplines is
now well represented with respect to most computer science (CS) curricula. But,
the two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing oppurtunities
to collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and
thereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several
ingredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user
interface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of
the human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model
to integrate the UI experts' UE development efforts with that of SE. This in
turn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of
education and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration
and coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the
current approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and
analyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having
substantial interactive components. We then propose four major themes of
learning for a comprehensive computing curriculum integrating SE, UE, and
system architectures in a project environment.

it is formed or when the geometry is perturbed. The state of a black hole when
the quasi-normal modes are excited is called the gravitational ringing, and
detections of it will be a direct confirmation of the existence of black holes.
To detect it, a method based on matched filtering needs to be developed.
Generically, matched filtering requires a large number of templates, because
one has to ensure a proper match of a real gravitational wave with one of
template waveforms to keep the detection efficiency as high as possible. On the
other hand, the number of templates must be kept as small as possible under
limited computational costs. In our previous paper, assuming that the
gravitational ringing is dominated by the least-damped (fundamental) mode with
the least imaginary part of frequency, we constructed an efficient method for
tiling the template space. However, the dependence of the template space metric
on the initial phase of a wave was not taken into account. This dependence
arises because of an unavoidable mismatch between the parameters of a signal
waveform and those given discretely in the template space. In this paper, we
properly take this dependence into account and present an improved, efficient
search method for gravitational ringing of black holes.

these models is that the entire parameter space will be tested at near future

information is obtained using the fact that the B' -> M1' M2' amplitude is

scale, can we conclude that neutrinos are Dirac particles? 3) If neutrinoless
double beta decay is observed with a large neutrino mass element, what is the

next generation beta decay searches for a neutrino mass only set a mass upper
limit, can we establish whether the mass hierarchy is normal or inverted? We
base our answers on the expected performance of next generation neutrinoless

dimensions. We start by reviewing in a pedagogical way the computation of the
standard perturbative gauge and gravitational anomalies on non-compact spaces,
using Fujikawa's approach and functional integral methods, and discuss the
available mechanisms for their cancellation. We then generalize these analyses
to the case of orbifold field theories with compact internal dimensions,
emphasizing the new aspects related to the presence of orbifold singularities
and discrete Wilson lines, and the new cancellation mechanisms that are
becoming available. We conclude with a very brief discussion on global and
parity anomalies.

numbers of a finite CW-complex with fundamental group G are integers if G is
torsion-free and are rational with denominators determined by the finite
subgroups of G in general. Here we establish conditions under which the Atiyah
conjecture for a group G implies the Atiyah conjecture for every finite
extension of G. The most important requirement is that the cohomology
$H^*(G,\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of the p-adic completion
of G for every prime p. An additional assumption is necessary, e.g. that the
quotients of the lower central series or of the derived series are
torsion-free. We prove that these conditions are fulfilled for a class of
groups which contains Artin's pure braid groups, free groups, surfaces groups,
certain link groups and one-relator groups. Therefore every finite, in fact
every elementary amenable extension of these groups satisfies the Atiyah
conjecture. In the course of the proof we prove that if these extensions are
torsion-free, then they have plenty of non-trivial torsion-free quotients which
are virtually nilpotent. All of this applies in particular to Artin's full
braid group, therefore answering question B6 on http://www.grouptheory.info .
Our methods also apply to the Baum-Connes conjecture. This is discussed in

  dynamics in complex systems""",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  We first review how to determine the rate of vibrational energy relaxation
(VER) using perturbation theory. We then apply those theoretical results to the
problem of VER of a CD stretching mode in the protein cytochrome c. We model
cytochrome c in vacuum as a normal mode system with the lowest-order anharmonic
coupling elements. We find that, for the ``lifetime'' width parameter $\gamma=3
\sim 30$ cm$^{-1}$, the VER time is $0.2 \sim 0.3$ ps, which agrees rather well
with the previous classical calculation using the quantum correction factor
method, and is consistent with spectroscopic experiments by Romesberg's group.
We decompose the VER rate into separate contributions from two modes, and find
that the most significant contribution, which depends on the ``lifetime'' width
parameter, comes from those modes most resonant with the CD vibrational mode.

they will never meet again, is a long-standing evolutionary puzzle with
profound implications. Cooperation is linked to altruism, the capacity to
perform costly acts that confer benefits on others. Theoretical approaches had
so far disregarded costly acts that do not yield future benefits for the
altruist, either directly or indirectly. Recently, strong reciprocity, i.e.,
the predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish non-cooperators at
personal cost, has been proposed as a schema for understanding altruism in
humans. While behavioral experiments support the existence of strong
reciprocity, its evolutionary origins remain unclear: group and cultural
selection are generally invoked to compensate for the negative effects that
reciprocity is assumed to have on individuals. Here we show, by means of an
agent-based model inspired on the Ultimatum Game, that selection acting on
individuals capable of other-regarding behavior can give rise to strong
reciprocity. The results, consistent with the existence of neural correlates of
fairness, are in good agreement with observations on humans and monkeys.

  Protein-coding Sequence","Submitted to Genome Research, 16 pages and 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.GN",,"  Background: Exonic splice enhancers are sequences embedded within exons which
promote and regulate the splicing of the transcript in which they are located.
A class of exonic splice enhancers are the SR proteins, which are thought to
mediate interactions between splicing factors bound to the 5' and 3' splice
sites. Method and results: We present a novel strategy for analysing
protein-coding sequence by first randomizing the codons used at each position
within the coding sequence, then applying a motif-based machine learning
algorithm to compare the true and randomized sequences. This strategy
identified a collection of motifs which can successfully discriminate between
real and randomized coding sequence, including -- but not restricted to --
several previously reported splice enhancer elements. As well as successfully
distinguishing coding exons from randomized sequences, we show that our model
is able to recognize non-coding exons. Conclusions: Our strategy succeeded in
detecting signals in coding exons which seem to be orthogonal to the sequences'
primary function of coding for proteins. We believe that many of the motifs
detected here may represent binding sites for previously unrecognized proteins
which influence RNA splicing. We hope that this development will lead to
improved knowledge of exonic splice enhancers, and new developments in the
field of computational gene prediction.

  (2005).","10.1117/12.542767",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum-mechanical phenomena are playing an increasing role in information
processing, as transistor sizes approach the nanometer level, and quantum
circuits and data encoding methods appear in the securest forms of
communication. Simulating such phenomena efficiently is exceedingly difficult
because of the vast size of the quantum state space involved. A major
complication is caused by errors (noise) due to unwanted interactions between
the quantum states and the environment. Consequently, simulating quantum
circuits and their associated errors using the density matrix representation is
potentially significant in many applications, but is well beyond the
computational abilities of most classical simulation techniques in both time
and memory resources. The size of a density matrix grows exponentially with the
number of qubits simulated, rendering array-based simulation techniques that
explicitly store the density matrix intractable. In this work, we propose a new
technique aimed at efficiently simulating quantum circuits that are subject to
errors. In particular, we describe new graph-based algorithms implemented in
the simulator QuIDDPro/D. While previously reported graph-based simulators
operate in terms of the state-vector representation, these new algorithms use
the density matrix representation. To gauge the improvements offered by
QuIDDPro/D, we compare its simulation performance with an optimized array-based
simulator called QCSim. Empirical results, generated by both simulators on a
set of quantum circuit benchmarks involving error correction, reversible logic,
communication, and quantum search, show that the graph-based approach far
outperforms the array-based approach.

formulated through time-local master equations which are not in Lindblad form.
It is shown that such processes can be embedded in a Markovian dynamics which
involves a time dependent Lindblad generator on an extended state space. If the
state space of the open system is given by some Hilbert space ${\mathcal{H}}$,
the extended state space is the triple Hilbert space
${\mathcal{H}}\otimes{\mathbb C}^3$ which is obtained by combining the open
system with a three state system. This embedding is used to derive an
unraveling for non-Markovian time evolution by means of a stochastic process in
the extended state space. The process is defined through a stochastic
Schr\""odinger equation which generates genuine quantum trajectories for the
state vector conditioned on a continuous monitoring of an environment. The
construction leads to a continuous measurement interpretation for non-Markovian
