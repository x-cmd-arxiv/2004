30 keV with unprecedented positional accuracy for a high-energy emission; a
sharp spectral drop is evident beyond this energy. Significant variability is
seen in the 20-30 keV light curve. Comparison with previous observations

classical ADAF approach, i.e. the inner hot flow develops whenever it can exist
(ii) disk evaporation model of Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister (2002) (iii)
generalized disk evaporation model of Rozanska & Czerny (2000b). For each of
the models, we determine the minimum value of the Eddington ratio and the
maximum value of the broad line widths as functions of the viscosity parameter
alpha and the magnetic field parameter beta. We compare the predicted parameter
space with observations of several AGN. Weak dependence of the maximum value of
the FWHM and minimum value of the Eddington ratio on the black hole mass in our
sample is noticeable. It seems to favor the description of the cold disk/hot
inner flow transition as in the classical ADAF approach than with the model of
disk evaporation due to conduction between the disk and accreting corona.

explosions is to explain the diversity of these events and the empirically
established correlation between their peak luminosity and light curve shape. In
the framework of the so-called Chandrasekhar mass models, the progenitor's
carbon-to-oxygen ratio has been suggested to be a principal source of peak
luminosity variations due to a variation in the production of radioactive
$^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The underlying idea is that an enhanced carbon
mass fraction should result in a more vigorous explosion since here the energy
release from nuclear reactions is increased. It was suspected that this would
produce a higher amount of $^{56}$Ni in the ejecta. In this letter we describe
a mechanism resulting from an interplay between nucleosynthesis and turbulent
flame evolution which counteracts such an effect. Based on three-dimensional
simulations we argue that it is nearly balanced and only minor differences in
the amount of synthesized $^{56}$Ni with varying carbon mass fraction in the
progenitor can be expected. Therefore this progenitor parameter is unlikely to
account for the observed variations in Type Ia supernova luminosity. We discuss
possible effects on the calibration of cosmological measurements.

$10^{6}M_{\odot}$, we find that dark matter accretion can boost the mass of
seed black holes from about $\sim 5M_{\odot}$ to $10^{3-4}M_{\odot}$ black

supermassive black holes of $10^{6 - 9}M_{\odot}$. We then show that the

J114816.64+525150.3 could be understood if the black hole completely consumes
the degenerate Fermi ball and then grows by Eddington - limited baryonic

masses to be within the range from 12 ${\rm keV/c}^{2}$ to about 450 ${\rm

formation time of the seed BH and on the mass of the seed BH. We find that in
order to fit the observed data point of $M_{BH} \sim 3 \times 10^{9}M_{\odot}$

alpha/beta absorption-line systems. We concentrate on the distribution and
physical properties of the WHIM as sampled by OVI and intrinsically broad Ly
alpha lines. The number of intervening OVI absorbers for equivalent widths W>24
mA is 3-6 over an unobscured redshift path of dz=0.368. This implies a number
density of OVI systems, dN/dz, of ~8-16 along this sight line. This range is
consistent with estimates from other sight lines, supporting the idea that
intervening intergalactic OVI absorbers contain an substantial fraction of the
baryonic mass in the low-redshift Universe. We identify a number of broad Ly
alpha absorbers with large Doppler parameters (b~40-200 km/s) and low column
densities (N(HI)<10^14 cm^-2). For pure thermal broadening, these widths
correspond to temperatures of ~1x10^5 to 3x10^6 K. While these broad absorbers
could be caused by blends of multiple, unresolved lines, continuum undulations,
or by kinematic flows and Hubble broadening, we consider the possibility that
some of these features are single-component, thermally broadened Ly alpha
lines. These systems could represent WHIM absorbers that are too weak, too
metal-poor, and/or too hot to be detected in OVI. If so, their widths and their
frequency in the PG1259+593 spectrum imply that these absorbers trace an even
larger fraction of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe than the OVI
absorbing systems (abridged version).

It is shown that the steady versions of these structures differ from their
nonrelativistic counterparts because they do not permit transformation to a de
Hoffmann/Teller reference frame, in which the electric field vanishes. Instead,
their generic form is that of a true neutral sheet: one in which the linking
magnetic field component normal to the sheet is absent. Taken together with
Alfven's limit on the total cross-field potential, this suggests plasma is
ejected from the sheet in the cross-field direction rather than along it. The
maximum energy to which such structures can accelerate particles is derived,
and used to compute the maximum frequency of the subsequent synchrotron
radiation. This can be substantially in excess of standard estimates. In the
magnetically driven gamma-ray burst scenario, acceleration of electrons is
possible to energies sufficient to enable photon-photon pair production after
an inverse Compton scattering event.

similar to the pre-stellar core L1544. However, the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) column
density ratio is ~0.1, a factor of about 2 lower than that found in L1544. The
observed relation between the deuterium fractionation and the integrated CO
depletion factor across the core can be reproduced by chemical models if N2H+

found to be 11.5{+1.1}{-0.9}keV, the highest X-ray temperature of any cluster
at z>0.6. In contrast to MS1054-0321, the only other very hot cluster currently
known at z>0.8, ClJ1226.9+3332 features a relaxed X-ray morphology, and its
high overall gas temperature is not caused by one or several hot spots. The
system thus constitutes a unique example of a high redshift, high temperature,
relaxed cluster, for which the usual hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, and
the X-ray mass is most reliable. A temperature profile is constructed (for the
first time at this redshift) and is consistent with the cluster being
isothermal out to 45% of the virial radius. Within the virial radius
(corresponding to a measured overdensity of a factor of 200), a total mass of
(1.4+/-0.5)*10^15 M_solar is derived, with a gas mass fraction of 12+/-5%. The
bolometric X-ray luminosity is (5.3+/-0.2)*10^45 erg/s. The probabilities of
finding a cluster of this mass within the volume of the discovery X-ray survey
are 8*10^{-5} for Omega_M=1 and 0.64 for Omega_M=0.3, making Omega_M=1 highly
unlikely. The entropy profile suggests that entropy evolution is being
observed. The metal abundance (of Z=0.33{+0.14}{-0.10} Z_solar), gas mass

infra-red (UIR) band emissions. The spectrum of this newly discovered BL is
most likely fluorescence from small neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) molecules. PAH molecules are thought to be widely present in many
interstellar and circumstellar environments in our galaxy as well as in other
galaxies, and are considered likely carriers of the UIR-band emission. However,
no specific PAH molecule has yet been identified in a source outside the solar
system, as the set of mid-infra-red emission features attributed to these
molecules between the wavelengths of 3.3 micron and 16.4 micron is largely
insensitive to molecular sizes. In contrast, near-UV/blue fluorescence of PAHs
is more specific as to size, structure, and charge state of a PAH molecule. If
the carriers of this near-UV/blue fluorescence are PAHs, they are most likely
neutral PAH molecules consisting of 3-4 aromatic rings such as anthracene
(C14H10) and pyrene (C16H10). These small PAHs would then be the largest
molecules specifically identified in the interstellar medium.

the onset of the first outburst, the source was found in a spectrally low/hard

high/soft state. The source flux (in 2$-$10 keV) reached $\sim$100 mCrab on
2002 April 6, then decayed rapidly. In power spectra, we detect strong
band-limited noise and varying low-frequency quasi periodic oscillations that

with experimental observations, and serves to highlight important deviations
from simple theory. We show that measurements of transverse resistance along
the channel permits establishing the position and the shape of the DW contained

an angle theta_i with respect to the helical axis, while the projection of

destabilization regime was well-developed and acted as the precursor of an
inevitable collapse fueled by raising expectations of investors to maintain
strong herding pressures. We have adapted Weidlich's theory of opinion
formation to describe the formation of buy or sell decisions among investors,
based on a competition between the mechanisms of herding and of personal
opinion opposing the herd. Among four typical patterns of stock price
evolution, we have identified a ``critical zone'' in the model characterized by
a strong sensitivity of the price trajectory on the herding and personal
inclination parameters. The critical zone describes the maturation of a
systemic instability forewarning of an inevitable crash. Classification and
recognition of the spontaneous emergence of patterns of stock market evolution
based on Weidlich's theory of complex systems, and in particular our discovery
of the post-bubble destabilization regime which acts as a precursor to a
subsequent crash or antibubble, not only presents the possibility of developing
early warning signals but also suggests to top management ways of dealing with
the coming crisis.

  Logic programming (TPLP)",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL",,"  Computer Aided Design systems provide tools for building and manipulating
models of solid objects. Some also provide access to programming languages so
that parametrised designs can be expressed. There is a sharp distinction,
therefore, between building models, a concrete graphical editing activity, and
programming, an abstract, textual, algorithm-construction activity. The
recently proposed Language for Structured Design (LSD) was motivated by a
desire to combine the design and programming activities in one language. LSD
achieves this by extending a visual logic programming language to incorporate
the notions of solids and operations on solids. Here we investigate another
aspect of the LSD approach; namely, that by using visual logic programming as
the engine to drive the parametrised assembly of objects, we also gain the
powerful symbolic problem-solving capability that is the forte of logic
programming languages. This allows the designer/programmer to work at a higher
level, giving declarative specifications of a design in order to obtain the
design descriptions. Hence LSD integrates problem solving, design synthesis,
and prototype assembly in a single homogeneous programming/design environment.
We demonstrate this specification-to-final-assembly capability using the
masterkeying problem for designing systems of locks and keys.

minimizes the norm of the gauge field, and measured the running coupling by
using the gluon propagator and the ghost propagator. In view of ambiguity in
the vertex renormalization factor \tilde Z_1 in the lattice, we adjust the
normalization of the running coupling by the perturbative QCD results near the
highest momentum point. It has a maximum \alpha_s(q)~ 2.1(3) at around q=0.5
GeV and decreases as q approaches 0, and the Kugo-Ojima parameter reached
-0.83(2). The infrared exponent of the ghost propagator at 0.4GeV region is
\alpha_G=0.20 but there is an exceptional Gribov copy with \alpha_G=0.27. The
features of the exceptional Gribov copy are investigated by measuring four
one-dimensional Fourier transform(1-d FT) of the gluon propagator transverse to
each lattice axis. We observe, in general, correlation between absolute value
of the Kugo-Ojima parameter and the degree of reflection positivity violation
in the 1-d FT of the gluon propagator. The 1-d FT of the exceptional Gribov
copy has an axis whose gluon propagator manifestly violates reflection
positivity, and the average of the Cartan subalgebra components of the
Kugo-Ojima parameter along this axis is consistent to -1. The running coupling
of the enemble average shows a suppression at 0 momentum, but when the ghost
propagator of the exceptional Gribov copy is adopted, the suppression
disappears and the data implies presence of the infrared fixed point

whether the ground-state heavy pentaquark lies above or below the strong-decay

transition form factors can be expressed in terms of three Isgur-Wise
functions: two of them are found to be normalized to unity at zero recoil,
while the third one is equal to 1/2 at the maximum momentum transfer, in
accordance with the prediction of the large-Nc approach or the quark model.
Therefore, the light-front model calculations are consistent with the
requirement of heavy quark symmetry. Numerical results for form factors and
Isgur-Wise functions are presented. Decay rates of the weak decays Theta_b+ to

illustrated by presenting a novel way to generate deviations from exact
bimaximal neutrino mixing. In type II see-saw mechanism with dominance of the
non-canonical SU(2)_L triplet term, the conventional see-saw term can give a
small contribution to the neutrino mass matrix. If the triplet term corresponds
to the bimaximal mixing scheme in the normal hierarchy, the small contribution
of the conventional see-saw term naturally generates non-maximal solar neutrino
mixing. Atmospheric neutrino mixing is also reduced from maximal, corresponding
to 1 - \sin^2 2 \theta_{23} of order 0.01. Also, small but non-vanishing U_{e3}
of order 0.001 is obtained. It is also possible that the \Delta m^2 responsible
for solar neutrino oscillations is induced by the small conventional see-saw
term. Larger deviations from zero U_{e3} and from maximal atmospheric neutrino
mixing are then expected. This scenario links the small ratio of the solar and
atmospheric \Delta m^2 with the deviation from maximal solar neutrino mixing.
We comment on leptogenesis in this scenario and compare the contributions to
the decay asymmetry of the heavy Majorana neutrinos as induced by themselves
and by the triplet.

that cosmic censorship can be violated in the AdS/CFT context. They argue that
for certain initial data there is insufficient energy available to make a black
hole whose horizon is big enough to cloak the singularity that forms. We have
investigated this proposal in the models HHM discuss and have thus far been
unable to find initial data that provably satisfy this criterion, despite our
development of an improved lower bound on the size of the singular region. This
is consistent with recent numerical results (hep-th/0402109). For certain
initial data, the energies of our configurations are not far above the lower
bound on the requisite black hole mass, and so it is possible that in the exact
time development naked singularities do form. We go on to argue that the finite
radius cut-off AdS_5 situation discussed by HHM displays instabilities when the
full 10D theory is considered. We propose an AdS_3 example that may well be
free of this instability.

Minkowski and de Sitter solutions localize gravity to the intersection, leading
to 4D Newtonian gravity at large distances. We show this explicitly in the case
of Minkowski origami by finding the zero-mode graviton, and computing the
couplings of the bulk gravitons to the matter on the intersection. In de Sitter
case, this follows from the finiteness of the bulk volume. The effective 4D

boundary terms depend on the exact boundary conditions one takes. We will check
two possible boundary conditions i.e. fixed bolt metric and fixed surface
gravity. In the case of fixed metric the the action acquires a boundary term
associated to the bifurcation but this is canceled in the Legendre
transformation and so absent in the canonical generator and so in this case the
possibility of a nontrivial central extension is ruled out. In the case of
fixed surface gravity the boundary term in the action is absent but present in
the Hamiltonian. Also in this case we will see that there is no nontrivial
central extension, also if there exist a boundary term in the generator.

presentation of the latters as quantum function algebras. When g = gl(n) these
Borel quantum function algebras are generated by the entries of a triangular
q-matrix, thus eventually U_q(gl(n)) is generated by the entries of an upper
triangular and a lower triangular q-matrix, which share the same diagonal. The
same elements generate over the ring of Laurent polynomials the unrestricted
integer form of U_q(gl(n)) of De Concini and Procesi, which we present
explicitly, together with a neat description of the associated quantum
Frobenius morphisms at roots of 1. All this holds, mutatis mutandis, for g =

  at the Winter School in Theoretical Physics, Schladming, Austria, March 2004",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In the lectures we will be concerned with some aspects of physical
implementations of quantum gate operations which are necessary for quantum
information processing. We will discuss two possible realizations. One of them
is based on qubits being encoded in atomic degrees of freedom where the atoms
are manipulated in optical lattices above atom chips. The other realization is
based on photonic qubits and measurement-induced nonlinearities in linear
optics. Both implementations have in common that their main decoherence
mechanism is absorption in dielectric materials. The quantum theory of light in
absorbing media and its implications to decoherence will form the last part of
the lectures.

called ""quantum walk"", in which the particle moves macroscopically correlating
to the inner states. It has been well known that a particle in the ``Hadamard
walk"" with two inner states spreads away quickly on a line. In contrast, we
find one-dimensional quantum walk with multi-state in which a particle stays at
the starting point entirely with high positive probability. This striking
difference is explained from difference between degeneration of eigenvalues of
the time-evolution matrices.

quantum information of an unknown state of a 2-level particle is faithfully
transmitted from a sender (Alice) to a remote receiver (Bob) via an initially
shared triplet of entangled particles under the control of the supervisor
Charlie. The distributed entangled particles shared by Alice, Bob and Charlie
function as a quantum information channel for faithful transmission. We also
propose a controlled and secure direct communication scheme by means of this
teleportation. After insuring the security of the quantum channel, Alice
encodes the secret message directly on a sequence of particle states and
transmits them to Bob supervised by Charlie using this controlled quantum
teleportation. Bob can read out the encoded message directly by the measurement
on his qubit. In this scheme, the controlled quantum teleportation transmits
Alice's message without revealing any information to a potential eavesdropper.
Because there is not a transmission of the qubit carrying the secret message
between Alice and Bob in the public channel, it is completely secure for
controlled and direct secret communication if perfect quantum channel is used.
The feature of this scheme is that the communication between two sides depends
on the agreement of the third side.
