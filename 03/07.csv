(B_{435}, V_{606}, i_{775}, and z_{850} with 10 sigma limits of 28.8, 29.0,
28.5, and 27.8, respectively) taken in parallel with the UDF NICMOS
observations. Using an i-z>1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin^2 down
to z_AB=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin^{-2}, with significant field-to-field
variation (as expected from cosmic variance). This extends i-dropout searches
some ~0.9^m further down the luminosity function than was possible in the GOODS
field, netting a ~7x increase in surface density. An estimate of the size
evolution for UV bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radial
flux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z<27.2) with scaled versions of the
HDF-N + HDF-S U-dropouts. The best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-1.57_{-0.53}
^{+0.50}} scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift
(1<z<5) trends to z~6. Adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts from
both GOODS fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z~6 LF in
the rest-frame continuum UV (~1350 A) over a 3.5 magnitude baseline, finding a
shape consistent with that found at lower redshift. To evaluate the evolution
in the LF from z~3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lower
redshift B-dropout sample. Though a strong degeneracy is found between
luminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)^{-2.8} in
number and (1+z)^0.1 in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum UV
luminosity density at z~6 which is just 0.38_{-0.07} ^{+0.09}x that at z~3.8.
Our inclusion of size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previous
z~6 estimates.

production and synchrotron self-absorption. The observed hard spectra suggest
heavy pair-loading in GRBs. The re-emission of the generated pairs results in
the energy transmission from high-energy gamma-rays to long-wavelength
radiation. Due to strong self-absorption, the synchrotron radiation by pairs is
in optically thick regime, showing a thermal-like spectral bump in the
extreme-ultraviolet/soft X-ray band, other than the peak from the main burst.
Recently, the prompt soft X-ray emission of GRB 031203 was detected thanks to
the discovery of a delayed dust echo, and it seems to be consistent with the
model prediction of a double-peak structure. The confirmation of the
thermal-like feature and the double-peak structure by observation would
indicate that the dominant radiation mechanism in GRBs is synchrotron rather
than inverse-Compton radiation.

tuning the photon energy and polarization, emission from the bonding or the
antibonding states can be enhanced. Moreover, at low photon energies (below 25
eV), the Fermi surface (FS) emission is dominated by transitions from just the
O-atoms in the CuO$_2$ planes. In connection with strong correlation effects,
we consider the evolution with doping of the FS of

computer science. A vertex cover of a graph is a subset of vertices such that
for each edge at least one of the two endpoints is contained in the subset.
When studied on Erdos-Renyi random graphs (with connectivity c) one observes a
threshold behavior: In the thermodynamic limit the size of the minimal vertex
cover is independent of the specific graph. Recent analytical studies show that
on the phase boundary, for small connectivities c<e, the system is replica
symmetric, while for larger connectivities replica symmetry breaking occurs.
This change coincides with a change of the typical running time of algorithms
from polynomial to exponential.
  To understand the reasons for this behavior and to compare with the
analytical results, we numerically analyze the structure of the solution
landscape. For this purpose, we have also developed an algorithm, which allows
the calculation of the backbone, without the need to enumerate all solutions.
We study exact solutions found with a Branch-and-Bound algorithm as well as
configurations obtained via a Monte Carlo simulation.
  We analyze the cluster structure of the solution landscape by direct
clustering of the states, by analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum of correlation
matrices and by using a hierarchical clustering method. All results are
compatible with a change at c=e. For small connectivities, the solutions are
collected in a finite small number of clusters, while the number of cluster
diverges slowly with system size for larger connectivities and replica symmetry
breaking, but not 1-RSB, occurs.

with proton number $Z$=100 - 140 and neutron number $N$= ($Z$+30) - (2$Z$+32)
by the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory with
interactions NL1, NL3, NLSH, TM1, TW99, DD-ME1, PK1, and PK1R. Based on the
two-nucleon separation energies $S_{2p}$ and $S_{2n}$, the two-nucleon gaps
$\delta_{2p}$ and $\delta_{2n}$, the shell correction energies $E_{shell}^{p}$
and $E_{shell}^{n}$, the pairing energies $E_{pair}^{p}$ and $E_{pair}^{n}$,
and the pairing gaps $\Delta_{p}$ and $\Delta_{n}$, $Z$=120, 132, and 138 and
$N$=172, 184, 198, 228, 238, and 258 are suggested to be the magic numbers
within the present approach. The $\alpha$-decay half-lives are also discussed.
In addition, the potential energy surfaces of possible doubly magic nuclei are
obtained by the deformation-constrained relativistic mean field (RMF) theory,
and the shell effects stabilizing the nuclei are investigated. Furthermore, the
formation cross sections of $^{292}_{172}$120 and $^{304}_{184}$120 at the
optimal excitation energy are estimated by a phenomenological cold fusion
reactions model with the structure information extracted from the constrained
RMF calculation.

complex domain, to a number of complex Hamiltonians, characterized by discrete
parity and time reversal (PT) symmetries and obtain their eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions. Examples of both quasi-exactly and exactly solvable potentials
are analyzed and the subtle differences, in the singularity structures of their
quantum momentum functions, are pointed out. The role of the PT symmetry in the
complex domain is also illustrated.

  Reconsideration of Foundations - 2', Vaexjoe, Sweden, June 2003",,,,"quant-ph",,"  I review the formalism of classical extensions of quantum mechanics
introduced by Beltrametti and Bugajski, and compare it to the classical
representations discussed e.g. by Busch, Hellwig and Stulpe and recently used
by Fuchs in his discussion of quantum mechanics in terms of standard quantum
measurements. I treat the problem of finding Bayesian analogues of the state
transition associated with measurement in the canonical classical extension as
well as in the related 'uniform' classical representation. In the classical
extension, the analogy is extremely good.

oracles out of $2^{N}$ ones, to determine which oracle in $S$ is the current
black-box oracle. We can exploit the information that candidates of the current
oracle is restricted to $S$. The OIP contains several concrete problems such as
the original Grover search and the Bernstein-Vazirani problem. Our interest is
in the quantum query complexity, for which we present several upper and lower
bounds. They are quite general and mostly optimal: (i) The query complexity of
OIP is $O(\sqrt{N\log M \log N}\log\log M)$ for {\it any} $S$ such that $M =
|S| > N$, which is better than the obvious bound $N$ if $M < 2^{N/\log^{3}N}$.
(ii) It is $O(\sqrt{N})$ for {\it any} $S$ if $|S| = N$, which includes the
upper bound for the Grover search as a special case. (iii) For a wide range of
oracles ($|S| = N$) such as random oracles and balanced oracles, the query
complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{N/K})$, where $K$ is a simple parameter determined
by $S$.
