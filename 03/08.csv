its PDF v(f) in an N-body system. It is based on Delaunay tessellation,
yielding v(f) with a fixed smoothing window over a wide f range, independent of
the sampling resolution. It is found that in a gravitationally relaxed halo
built by hierarchical clustering, v(f) is a robust power law, v(f) f^{-2.5 \pm
0.05}, over more than 4 decades in f, from its virial level to the current
resolution limit. This is valid for halos of different sizes in the LCDM
cosmology, indicating insensitivity to the initial-fluctuation power spectrum
as long as the small-scale fluctuations were not completely suppressed. By
mapping f in position space, we find that the high-f contributions to v(f) come
from the ""cold"" subhalos within the parent halo rather than the halo central
region and its global spherical profile. The f in subhalos near the halo virial
radius is more than 100 times higher than at the halo center, and it decreases
gradually with decreasing radius. This indicates phase mixing due to mergers
and tidal effects involving puffing up and heating. The phase-space structure
provides a sensitive tool for studying the evolution of subhalos during the
buildup of halos. One wishes to understand why the substructure adds up to the
universal power law in v(f). It seems that the f^{-2.5} behavior is related to
the hierarchical clustering process and is not a general result of violent
relaxation.

(ii) for $n \agt 3.01$, the nondimensional angular momentum parameter $q \equiv

gravitational collapse of rigidly rotating and marginally stable massive stars

that solar axions of the Kaluza-Klein type should result in the emission of
X-rays from the Sun direction beyond the limb with a characteristic radial
distribution. These X-rays should be observed more easily during periods of
quiet Sun. An additional signature is the observed emission of hard X-rays by
SMM, NEAR and RHESSI. The recent observation made by RHESSI of a continuous

targeted observations with present and upcoming (solar) X-ray telescopes, which
can provide the final answer on the nature of the signals considered here. Such
measurements become more promising during the forthcoming solar cycle minimum

fitted to the data which also solves for the distance to the LMC and SMC. When

quadratic term in log P is found, as previously observed and also predicted in

Although there are peaks in the X-ray periodograms at periods less than 5000 s,
we attribute them to red noise effects and assign significance to them using a
novel approach. The variability in the UV and optical bands can also be
modelled as a result of aperiodic variability (red noise) in the system. There
is evidence that the UV and X-ray fluxes are anti-correlated with a time delay
of about 100 s, with the UV lagging behind the X-ray emission. This
anti-correlation is intriguing, but is only present on two occasions lasting
several 1000 s each. The X-ray spectrum shows similar emission features to
other dwarf novae and is well fitted using a multi-temperature emission model.
We measure a relatively high X-ray luminosity of ~1.4x10^{32} ergs/s, although
this is consistent with a low binary inclination. Finally, we find evidence for
a possible -1200km/s blue shift in the fitted Fe K line energies, possibly
indicating the presence of an outflow in this low inclination system.

propose, that knotty morphology of the discussed jet, which is observed now

dominated by self-gravity. We have computed the gravitational stress tensor and
compared our results with expectations based on a local theory of transport. We

impurity concentration and phase shift. Although the thermoelectric effect
vanishes identically in the strict Born and unitary limits, even a small
deviation of the phase shift from these limits leads to a large response,
especially in clean systems. We also discuss possibilities of measuring
counter-flowing supercurrents in a SQUID-setup. The non-quantized
thermoelectrically induced flux can easily be of the order of a percent of the

from the Rouse-Zimm (RZ) theory, the Boussinesq friction force acts on the
monomers (beads) instead of the Stokes force, and the motion of the solvent is
governed by the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained generalized
RZ equation is solved approximately. It is shown that the time correlation
functions describing the polymer motion essentially differ from those in the RZ
model. The mean-square displacement (MSD) of the polymer coil is at short times
\~ t^2 (instead of ~ t). At long times the MSD contains additional (to the
Einstein term) contributions, the leading of which is ~ t^(1/2). The relaxation
of the internal normal modes of the polymer differs from the traditional
exponential decay. It is displayed in the long-time tails of their correlation
functions, the longest-lived being ~ t^(-3/2) in the Rouse limit and t^(-5/2)
in the Zimm case, when the hydrodynamic interaction is strong. It is discussed
that the found peculiarities, in particular an effectively slower diffusion of
the polymer coil, should be observable in dynamic scattering experiments.

non-BPS D-branes on the basis of boundary string field theory. We calculate the
finite temperature effective potential of N D-brane-anti-D-brane pairs in a
non-compact background and in a toroidal background. In the non-compact
background case, a phase transition occurs slightly below the Hagedorn
temperature, and the D9-anti-D9 pairs become stable. Moreover, the total energy
at the critical temperature is a decreasing function of N as long as the 't
Hooft coupling is very small. This leads to the conclusion that a large number
N of D9-anti-D9 pairs are created simultaneously near the Hagedorn temperature.
In the toroidal background case (M_{1,9-D} * T_{D}), a phase transition occurs
only if the Dp-anti-Dp pair is extended in all the non-compact directions, as
long as the 't Hooft coupling is very small. The total energy at the critical
temperature also decreases as N increases. We also calculate the finite
temperature effective potential of non-BPS D-branes, and we obtain similar
results. Then, we consider the thermodynamic balance between open strings on
these branes and closed strings in the bulk in the ideal gas approximation, and
conclude that the total energy is dominated by the open strings.

formulation complementing these two is presented in this work. It is an
indirect method which studies resonances in a complex charge plane (Z-plane).
The complex scaling (rotation) method is employed in the development of this
formulation. Bound states spectrum and resonance energies are mapped onto a
discrete set of poles of a resolvent operator on the real line of the Z-plane.
These poles move along trajectories as we vary the energy. A finite L2 basis is
used in the numerical implementation of the method. Stability of poles and
trajectories against variations in all computational parameters is
demonstrated. Resonances for a given potential example are calculated and
compared with those obtained elsewhere. In this presentation, modest effort
will be devoted to mathematical rigor.

Kamada","On the usefulness of the spectral function concept","27 pages, 25 fugures",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.70.034005",,"nucl-th",,"  The usefulness of the spectral function S in the process 3He(e,e'N) has been
investigated in a kinematical regime constrained by the conditions that the
three-nucleon center-of-mass energy is less than 150 MeV and the magnitude of
the three-momentum transfer smaller than 600 MeV/c. Results based on a full
treatment of the final state interaction are compared to the spectral function
approximation. In the case of proton knockout in the direction of the photon
kinematical conditions have been identified where both response functions, RL
and RT, can be well approximated by S. These conditions occur for certain low
missing momenta and missing energies but not in all cases. So care is required.
In case of neutron knockout only RT is a candidate for an approximate treatment
by S. In the case of RL the concept of using S is not valid in the studied
kinematical regime. This does not exclude the possibility that beyond that
regime it might be useful. Possible applications using S for the extraction of
electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons are pointed out.

In this paper we attempt to lay out such a basic mechanism, namely intrinsic
plasticity. Important empirical observations with theoretical significance are
time-layering of neural plasticity mediated by additional constraints to enter
into later stages, various manifestations of intrinsic neural properties, and
conditional gating of synaptic connections. An important consequence of the
proposed mechanism is that it can explain the usually latent nature of
memories.

scattering by saturated atoms. We consider the scattering of a
quasi-monochromatic laser pulse by two distant atoms in free space. By
restricting ourselves to scattering of two photons, we employ a perturbative
approach, valid up to second order in the incident laser intensity. The
backscattering enhancement factor is found to be smaller than two (after
excluding single scattering), indicating a loss of coherence between the doubly
scattered light emitted by both atoms. Since the undetected photon carries
information about the path of the detected photon, the coherence loss can be
explained by a which-path argument, in analogy with a double-slit experiment.

means that a parameter $x$ is changed in time. More generally, $x$ may be a
dynamical variable. In such case the interaction of $(x,p)$ with the
environmental degrees of freedom $(Q,P)$ leads to dephasing as well as to
dissipation. We introduce a general framework for the analysis of dissipation
and dephasing, and we clarify the tight connection to recent studies of quantum
irreversibility (also referred to as ""Loschmidt echo"" or as the ""fidelity"" of
quantum computation). Specific model systems that will be presented are:
particle in a box driven by moving a wall, and particle in a box/ring driven by
electro-motive-force. These two examples are related to studies of nuclear
friction and mesoscopic conductance.

of robust error-correcting schemes, has fuelled extensive efforts to build a
quantum computer. The requirements for realizing such a device are confounding:
scalable quantum bits (two-level quantum systems, or qubits) that can be well
isolated from the environment, but also initialized, measured and made to
undergo controllable interactions to implement a universal set of quantum logic
gates. The usual set consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate, which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control
qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental
demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT operation in
an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell states as a function of
only the input qubits' logical values, for a single operating condition of the
gate. The gate is probabilistic (the qubits are destroyed upon failure), but
with the addition of linear optical quantum non-demolition measurements, it is
equivalent to the CNOT gate required for scalable all-optical quantum
computation.
