thermal electrons in the magnetic field of accretion flow. For typical

the new contributions from the modified background expansion and fluctuations.
We show how the lensing equation gets modified by the cosmic expansion as well
as by the presence of the anisotropic stress, which is non-null at the linear
level both in scalar-tensor gravity and in theories where the gravitational
Lagrangian term features a non-minimal dependence on the Ricci scalar. Starting
from the geodesic deviation, we derive the generalized expressions for the
shear tensor and projected lensing potential, encoding the spacetime variation
of the effective gravitational constant and isolating the contribution of the
anisotropic stress, which introduces a correction due to the spatial
correlation between the gravitational potentials. Finally, we work out the

find that the chance to reach consensus is much higher as compared to other
models; if the number of possible opinions Q<=7, in fact, consensus is always
reached, which might explain the stability of political coalitions with more
than three or four parties. For Q>7 the number S of surviving opinions is
approximately the same independently of the size N of the population, as long

states having a fully polarization, can produce intrinsic decoherence by
unitary evolution. This effect can give an understanding of recent experiments
on mesoscopic devices as quantum point contacts showing the 0.7 conductance
anomaly and the wide number of data about saturation of dephasing time observed
at very low temperatures, as a fully polarized two dimensional electron gas.
But similar effects can be seen in different area of physics as for example the
Dicke model describing the interaction of two-level systems with a radiation
mode. In this case one can show that decoherence is intrinsic and remove a
Schr\""odinger cat state leaving a single coherent state, collapsing the wave
function in the thermodynamic limit. So, saturation of dephasing time at low
temperatures in mesoscopic devices can be understood by a fully polarized two
dimensional electron gas that, by an exchange model, can be reduced to a
generalized form of the Dicke Hamiltonian and where the quasiparticles are spin
excitations interacting with magnons. In this way, one can see that several
experiments on nanowires and quantum dots can be satisfactorily explained. The
existence of intrinsic decoherence in the thermodynamic limit could have deep
implications in fundamental problems like quantum measurement and
irreversibility. Recent experiments with cavities with a large number of
photons and with nuclear magnetic resonance in organic molecular crystals give
a first strong support to this view.

demonstrate that their interaction results in a {\em large} and {\em rapid}

(two-valued) logic. Quantum logic was proposed by Birkhoff and von Neumann as a
logic of quantum mechanics more than sixty years ago. The major difference
between Boolean logic and quantum logic is that the latter does not enjoy
distributivity in general. The rapid development of quantum computation in
recent years stimulates us to establish a theory of computation based on
quantum logic. The present paper is the first step toward such a new theory and
it focuses on the simplest models of computation, namely finite automata. It is
found that the universal validity of many properties of automata depend heavily
upon the distributivity of the underlying logic. This indicates that these
properties does not universally hold in the realm of quantum logic. On the
other hand, we show that a local validity of them can be recovered by imposing
a certain commutativity to the (atomic) statements about the automata under
consideration. This reveals an essential difference between the classical
theory of computation and the computation theory based on quantum logic.

rise to certain non-abelian symmetries known as Yangians. Analogously
`boundary' symmetries arise when general but still integrable boundary
conditions are implemented, as originally argued by Delius, Mackay and Short
from the field theory point of view, in the context of the principal chiral
model on the half line. In the present study we deal with a discrete quantum
mechanical system with boundaries, that is the $N$ site $gl(n)$ open quantum
spin chain. In particular, the open spin chain with two distinct types of
boundary conditions known as soliton preserving and soliton non-preserving is
considered. For both types of boundaries we present a unified framework for
deriving the corresponding boundary non-local charges directly at the quantum
level. The non-local charges are simply coproduct realizations of particular
boundary quantum algebras called `boundary' or twisted Yangians, depending on
the choice of boundary conditions. Finally, with the help of linear
intertwining relations between the solutions of the reflection equation and the
generators of the boundary or twisted Yangians we are able to exhibit the
symmetry of the open spin chain, namely we show that a number of the boundary
non-local charges are in fact conserved quantities

scintillation characteristics under irradiation with gamma-quanta at the
uniformly distributed absorbed dose up to 3700 rad. The sample set consisted of
25 crystals of 30 cm long having a truncated pyramid shape and 30 rectangular
crystals of the same length. A large difference in the light output
deterioration caused by the radiation was observed for the samples of the same
shape. A substantial dependence of the average light output loss from the
sample shape is seen as well. On the other hand, the crystals from the same
ingot behave very similarly under irradiation.

tuning activity of cytotoxic cells on the triggered immune response in a
growing cancerous tissue. The immune response is assumed to be primarily
mediated by effector cells that develop a cytotoxic activity against the
abnormal tissue. The kinetics of such a reaction is represented by an
enzymatic-like Michaelis-Menten two step process. Effective free-energy surface
for the process is further parametrized by the fluctuating energy barrier
between the states of high and low concentration of cancerous cells. By
analyzing the far from equilibrium escape problem across the fluctuating
potential barrier, we determine condtions of the most efficient decay kinetics
of the cancer cell-population in the presence of dichotomously fluctuating
concentration of cytotoxic cells.

theoretical foundations of high-precision spectroscopy using the resonance
fluorescence light of strongly laser-driven atoms. Specifically, we evaluate
the leading relativistic and radiative corrections to the Mollow spectrum, up
to the relative orders of (Z alpha)^2 and alpha(Z alpha)^2, respectively, and
Bloch-Siegert shifts as well as stimulated radiative corrections involving
off-resonant virtual states. Complete results are provided for the hydrogen

allow for a sensitive test of the validity of the dressed-state basis as the
natural description of the combined atom-laser system.

and the third of a strong, continuous coupling. Decoherence is shown to be
suppressed only if the frequency N of the measurements/pulses is large enough

but not extremely large, all these control procedures accelerate decoherence.

practical examples, relevant for quantum computation.
