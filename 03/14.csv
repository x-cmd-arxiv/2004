will deliver the first unresolved image of an extrasolar planet. The emitted
thermal infrared light from the planet should show no phase effect assuming the
planet is in thermal equilibrium. But the reflected visible light will vary
versus the phase angle. Here, we study the photometric variation of the
reflected light versus the orbital phase of a ringed extrasolar planet. We show
that a ring around an extrasolar planet, both obviously unresolved, can be
detected by its specific photometric signature. A simple quantitative model is
discussed, taking into account the basic optical and geometrical properties of
the ringed planet.

an increasing trend with age. We propose that this trend is a dynamical effect
resulting from the accumulation of massive stars and stellar-mass black holes
at the cluster centers. The black holes are remnants of stars with initial
masses exceeding 20-25 solar masses; as their orbits decay by dynamical
friction, they heat the stellar background and create a core. Using analytical
estimates and N-body experiments, we show that the sizes of the cores so
produced and their growth rates are consistent with what is observed. We
propose that this mechanism is responsible for the formation of cores in all
globular clusters and possibly in other systems as well.

variability of six Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies observed at 172
epochs. We searched for microvariability on 33 nights. Strong evidence for
microvariability was found only for our lowest luminosity object, NGC 4051, on
one night. Weaker evidence suggests such variability on a few other nights for
two other objects, but the data are not as convincing. Intra-night variability
in NLS1s is thus concluded to be rare and of low amplitude. We give
illustrations of how variable image quality can produce spurious variability.
We find that for well-studied non-NLS1s there is a spread in the amplitude of
seasonal variability (i.e., in some years an AGN is more variable than in
others). We find that the means of the variability amplitudes of non-NLS1s over
several seasons vary from object to object (i.e., some AGNs are, on average,
more variable than others). NLS1s also show a spread in seasonal variabilities.
The best-studied NLS1, Ark 564, shows a range of amplitudes of variability from
season to season that is comparable to the range found in BLS1s, and in one
season Ark 564 was as variable as the most variable non-NLS1. The seasonal
amplitudes of variability for NLS1s are mostly in the lower half of the range
of non-BLS1 seasonal amplitudes, but the absence of a suitable control sample
makes a precise comparison difficult. However, on long timescales (weeks to
years), NLS1s as a class are not more variable than non-NLS1s. The extreme
variability seen in the X-rays was not seen in the optical. This has
consequences for the models of AGNs in general as well as NLS1s in particular.

at 250 K in Raman scattering (RS) experiments by the simultaneous onset of

of the superconducting gap manifests itself as a redistribution of electronic
Raman scattering below the superconducting transition temperature, T_c = 24K. A
pronounced temperature-dependent suppression of the intensity of the (100)

a change of relative volume fraction of superconducting and antiferromagnetic

show that the RD admixture acts as a dilatation mechanism to the fundamental
time and height scales, but leaves the KPZ correlations intact. This
observation is generalized to other growth models. It is shown that the
flat-substrate initial condition is responsible for the existence of an early
non-scaling phase in the interface evolution. The length of this initial phase
is a non-universal parameter, but its presence is universal. In application to
parallel and distributed computations, the important consequence of the derived

conservative update algorithm for parallel discrete-event simulations. It is
shown that such algorithms are generally scalable in a ring communication

finite, and involves the positron velocity. The calculation of the outer part
is straightforward, but that of the inner part requires a scrutiny concerning
the continuation of the long-distance hadronic calculation to the
short-distance quark treatment and the dependence on the model of hadron
structure. We show that the logarithmically divergent parts do not depend on
the structure of hadrons not only for the Fermi part, but also for the
Gamow-Teller part. This observation enables us to deal with the inner part for
the Gamow-Teller transition nearly parallel to that for the Fermi transition.

quark matter the color SU(3) symmetry is spontaneously broken down to SU(2). If
the usual counting of Goldstone bosons would apply, five Nambu-Goldstone (NG)
bosons corresponding to the five broken color generators should appear in the
mass spectrum. Unlike that expectation, we find only three gapless diquark
excitations of quark matter. One of them is an SU(2)-singlet, the remaining two
form an SU(2)-(anti)doublet and have a quadratic dispersion law in the small
momentum limit. These results are in agreement with the Nielsen-Chadha theorem,
according to which NG-bosons in Lorentz-noninvariant systems, having a
quadratic dispersion law, must be counted differently. The origin of the
abnormal number of NG-bosons is shown to be related to a nonvanishing
expectation value of the color charge operator Q_8 reflecting the lack of color
neutrality of the ground state. Finally, by requiring color neutrality, two
massive diquarks are argued to become massless, resulting in a normal number of
five NG-bosons with usual linear dispersion laws.

(or an exact operator space $E\subset A$) to $\ell_2$ equipped with the
operator space structure of $(C,R)_\theta$ ($0<\theta<1$) obtained by complex
interpolation between the column and row Hilbert spaces. More precisely, if $F$
denotes $\ell_2$ equipped with the operator space structure of $(C,R)_\theta$,
then $u: A \to F$ is completely bounded iff there are states $f,g$ on $A$ and
$C>0$ such that \[ \forall a\in A\quad \|ua\|^2\le C
f(a^*a)^{1-\theta}g(aa^*)^{\theta}.\] This extends the case $\theta=1/2$
treated in a recent paper with Shlyakhtenko. The constants we obtain tend to 1
when $\theta \to 0$ or $\theta\to 1$. We use analogues of ""free Gaussian""
families in non semifinite von Neumann algebras. As an application, we obtain
that, if $0<\theta<1$, $(C,R)_\theta$ does not embed completely isomorphically
into the predual of a semifinite von Neumann algebra. Moreover, we characterize
the subspaces $S\subset R\oplus C$ such that the dual operator space $S^*$
embeds (completely isomorphically) into $M_*$ for some semifinite von neumann
algebra $M$: the only possibilities are $S=R$, $S=C$, $S=R\cap C$ and direct
sums built out of these three spaces. We also discuss when $S\subset R\oplus C$
is injective, and give a simpler proof of a result due to Oikhberg on this
question. In the appendix, we present a proof of Junge's theorem that $OH$
embeds completely isomorphically into a non-commutative $L_1$-space. The main
idea is similar to Junge's, but we base the argument on complex interpolation
and Shlyakhtenko's generalized circular systems (or ``generalized free

  First, we study a class of conformally invariant operators $P$ and their

manifolds. When the manifold is locally conformally flat(LCF) and compact
without boundary, $Q$-curvature is naturally related to the integrand in the
classical Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula, i.e., the Pfaffian curvature. For a class
of even-dimensional complete LCF manifolds with integrable $Q$% -curvature, we
establish a Gauss-Bonnet-Chern inequality.
  Second, a finiteness theorem for certain classes of complete LCF four-fold
with integrable Pfaffian curvature is also proven. This is an extension of the
classical results of Cohn-Vossen and Huber in dimension two. It also can be
viewed as a fully non-linear analogue of results of Chang-Qing-Yang in
dimension four.
