  Unless the orbital inclination is $\leq 86 ^\circ$, the duration of eclipses

We propose that eclipses occur due to synchrotron absorption by mildly

evolutionary process that gives rise to the formation of the white dwarf or its
helium-star progenitor: dynamically stable Roche-lobe overflow (Algol-type

evolution), or stellar winds (single star evolution). We examine the
sensitivity of the population to changes in the amount of mass lost from the
system during stable Roche-lobe overflow, the common-envelope ejection
efficiency, and the initial mass ratio or initial secondary mass distribution.
In the case of a flat initial mass ratio distribution, the local space density
of WDMS binaries is of the order of 10^{-3}/pc^3. This number decreases to
10^{-4}/pc^3 when the initial mass ratio distribution is approximately
proportional to the inverse of the initial mass ratio. More than 75% of the
WDMS binary population stems from wide systems in which both components evolve
as if they were single stars. The remaining part of the population is dominated
by systems in which the white dwarf is formed in a common-envelope phase. The
birthrate of WDMS binaries forming through a common-envelope phase is about 10
times larger than the birthrate of WDMS binaries forming through a stable
Roche-lobe overflow phase. The ratio of the number of helium white dwarf

recently, with the advent of large scale imaging of its $^{3}P_{1}\to

been fully revealed. In the present work we show that under {\it typical} ISM

processes are more intense in star-forming environments where a larger ambient
cosmic ray flux will also play an important role in boosting [C]/[$ ^{12}$CO].
The resulting CI lines can be bright and effective H$_2$ mass tracers
especially for diffuse ($\sim 10^2-10^3\rm cm^{-3}$) gas while in UV-intense
and/or metal-poor environments their H$_2$-tracing capability diminishes
because of large scale CII production but nevertheless remains superior to that

H$_2$ is not in the low-$z$ Universe, where large atmospheric absorption at 492

significant number of stable multiple systems, with components separations in
the range 1-1000 AU. At the end of the hydrodynamical evolution (0.5 Myr) we
find that ~60% of stars and brown dwarfs are members of multiples systems, with
about a third of these being low mass, weakly bound outliers in wide eccentric
orbits. Our results imply that in the stellar regime most stars are in
multiples (~80%) and that this fraction is an increasing function of primary
mass. After Nbody integration to 10.5 Myr, the percentage of bound objects has
dropped to ~40%, as most very low mass stars and brown dwarfs have been
released to the field. Brown dwarfs are never found to be very close companions
to stars (brown dwarf desert at very small separations), but one case exists of
a brown dwarf companion at intermediate separations (10 AU). Our simulations
can accommodate the existence of brown dwarf companions at large separations,

which affects the diffuse spectrum is the separation between sources. In the
case of a uniform distribution of sources with a separation between them much
smaller than all characteristic propagation lengths, the diffuse spectrum of
UHE particles has a {\em universal} form, independent of the mode of
propagation. This statement has a status of theorem. The proof is obtained
using the particle number conservation during propagation, and also using the
kinetic equation for the propagation of UHE particles. This theorem can be also
proved with the help of the diffusion equation. In particular, it is shown
numerically, how the diffuse fluxes converge to this universal spectrum, when
the separation between sources diminishes. We study also the analytic solution
of the diffusion equation in weak and strong magnetic fields with energy losses
taken into account. In the case of strong magnetic fields and for a separation
between sources large enough, the GZK cutoff can practically disappear, as it

a new type of all-sky monitor in this energy regime based on water Cherenkov
technology (Milagro). To fully understand the universe at these extreme
energies requires a highly sensitive detector capable of continuously

emission from gamma-ray bursts and probe the limits of Lorentz invariance at
high energies. With sufficient sensitivity it could detect short transients
($\sim$15 minutes) from active galaxies and study the time structure of flares

care must be taken both in implementation, and in a detailed understanding of
limitations caused by residual foregrounds which can still affect cosmological
results. As a first step we demonstrate how to compute the ILC weights both
accurately and efficiently by means of Lagrange multipliers, and apply this
method to the observed data to produce a new version of the ILC map. Next we
describe how to generate Monte Carlo simulations of the ILC map, and find that
these agree well with the observed map on angular scales up to l~200. Finally
we make two comments to the on-going debates concerning the large-scale
properties of the WMAP data. First, we note that the Galactic south-eastern
quadrant is associated with notably different ILC weights than the other three
quadrants, possibly indicating a foreground related anisotropy. Second, we
study the properties of the quadrupole and octopole (amplitude, alignment and
planarity), and confirm the previously reported anomalies. Even more
interestingly, we find that the l=5 mode is spherically symmetric at about 3
sigma, and that the l=6 mode is planar at the 2 sigma level. However, we also
assess the impact of residual foregrounds on these statistics, and find that

Space Telescope has been very successful, attempts to detect its atmospheric
absorption features using ground-based telescopes have so far been fruitless.
Here we present a new method for probing the atmospheres of transiting
exoplanets which may be more suitable for ground-based observations, making use
of the Rossiter effect. During a transit, an exoplanet sequentially blocks off
light from the approaching and receding parts of the rotating star, causing an
artificial radial velocity wobble. The amplitude of this signal is directly
proportional to the effective size of the transiting object, and the wavelength
dependence of this effect can reveal atmospheric absorption features, in a
similar way as with transmission spectroscopy. The advantage of this method
over conventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy is that it does not
rely on accurate photometric comparisons of observations on and off transit,
but instead depends on the relative velocity shifts of individual stellar
absorption lines within the same on-transit spectra. We used an archival
VLT/UVES data set to apply this method to HD209458. The amplitude of the
Rossiter effect is shown to be 1.7+-1.2 m/sec higher in the Sodium D lines than
in the weighted average of all other absorption lines in the observed
wavelength range, corresponding to an increment of 4.3+-3% (1.4 sigma). The
uncertainty in this measurement compares to a photometric accuracy of 5e-4 for
conventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy, more than an order of
magnitude higher than previous attempts using ground-based telescopes.
Observations specifically designed for this method could increase the accuracy
further by a factor 2-3.

in the halo, suggesting more effective gas removal on the side of the galaxy
which is rotating into the ICM wind. The galaxy is 3.3 degrees ~800 kpc from
M87, somewhat outside the region of strongest cluster X-ray emission. The ram
pressure may be significantly stronger than standard values, due to large bulk
motions and local density enhancements of the ICM gas, which may occur in a
dynamic, shock-filled ICM experiencing subcluster merging. The HI and H-alpha
distributions are similar, implying that the star-forming molecular ISM has
been effectively stripped from the outer disk of the galaxy along with the HI.

of dark matter halos, to predict the number of radio-loud quasars as a function
of redshift and luminosity. Simple models in which the central BH mass scales
with the velocity dispersion of its host halo as M(bh) sigma(halo)^5 have been
previously found to be consistent with a number of observations, including the
optical and X-ray quasar luminosity functions. We find that similar models,
when augmented with an empirical prescription for radio emission, overpredict
the number of faint (10 micro-Jy) radio sources by 1-2 orders of magnitude.
This translates into a more stringent constraint on the low-mass end of the
quasar black hole mass function than is available from the Hubble and Chandra
Deep Fields. We interpret this discrepancy as evidence that black holes with
masses below 10^7 Msun are either rare or are not as radio-loud as their more
massive counterparts. Models that exclude BHs with masses below 10^7 Msun are
in agreement with the deepest existing radio observations, but still produce a
significant tail of high-redshift objects. In the 1-10GHz bands, at the
sensitivity of 10 micro-Jy, we find surface densities of 100, 10, and 0.3
deg^-2 for sources located at z>6, 10, and 15, respectively. The discovery of
these sources with instruments such as the Allen Telescope Array (ATA),
Extended Very Large Array (EVLA), and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) would
open a new window for the study of supermassive BHs at high redshift. We also
find surface densities of 0.1 deg^-2 at z > 6 for mJy sources that can be used
to study 21 cm absorption from the epoch of reionization. We suggest that,
although not yet optically identified, the FIRST survey may have already
detected 10^3-10^4 such sources.

this high Iron abundance is fully consistent with the predictions of stellar

The spatially resolved, high quality XMM spectra provide enough statistics to
formally require at least three emission components: two soft thermal

found to be super-solar. The a-elements to Fe abundance ratio is close to the
solar ratio, suggesting that ~70% of the Iron mass in the hot ISM was
originated from SNe Type Ia. The a-element to Fe abundance ratio remains
constant out to at least 100 kpc, indicating that SNe Type II and Ia ejecta are
well mixed in a scale much larger than the extent of the stellar body.

located within 20"" (the telescope half beamwidth) of the program objects. The
detection rate of 48 percent is comparable to that obtained in Bulge IRAS
source surveys. Among the SiO detections, five stars have radial velocities
greater than 200 km/s. The SiO detection rate increases steeply with the period
of light variation, particularly for stars with P>500 d, where it exceeds 80%.
We found that, at a given period, the SiO detection rate is approximately three
times that for OH. These facts suggest that the large-amplitude variables in
the Nuclear Disk region are AGB stars similar in their overall properties to
the inner and outer Bulge IRAS/SiO sources. From the set of radial velocity
data, the mass distribution within 30 pc of the galactic center is derived by a
new method which is based on the collisionless Boltzmann equation integrated
along the line of sight. The mass within 30 pc is about 6.4 [\pm 0.7] \times

its potential energy leads to the conclusion that the five high-velocity stars
come from galactocentric distances as high as 300 pc. The high-velocity

brighter K magnitudes than the subsample of stars with positive velocities. The
origin of these high-velocity stars is discussed.

The results exemplify the excellent WFC capability to detect brief X-ray
transients. Firstly, the WFCs expanded the known population of Galactic
thermonuclear X-ray bursters by 50%. At least half of all LMXBs are now
established to burst and, thus, to contain a neutron star as compact accretor
rather than a black hole candidate. We provide a complete list of all 76

luminosities up to ~10^37 erg/s and durations from days to weeks. One is the
first accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. Thirdly, the WFCs
contributed considerably towards establishing that nearly all (12 out of 13)
luminous low-mass X-ray binaries in Galactic globular clusters contain neutron
stars rather than black holes. Thus, the neutron star to black hole ratio in
clusters differs from that in the Galactic disk at a marginal confidence level

This system gives rise to a partial Lyman limit break and absorption in MgII,
SiII, CII, SiIII, SiIV, CIV, and OVI. The lower ionization transitions arise in
two kinematic subsystems with a separation of ~150 km/s. Each subsystem is
resolved into several narrow components, having Doppler widths of 3-10 kms. For
both subsystems, the OVI absorption arises in a separate higher ionization
phase, in regions dominated by bulk motions in the range of 30-40 km/s. The two
OVI absorption profiles are kinematically offset by ~50 km/s with respect to
each of the two lower ionization subsystem. In the stronger subsystem, the
SiIII absorption is strong with a distinctive, smooth profile shape and may
partially arise in shock heated gas. Moreover, the kinematic substructure of
SiIV traces that of the lower ionization MgII, but may be offset by ~3 km/s.
Based upon photoionization models, constrained by the partial Lyman limit
break, we infer a low metallicity of ~0.03 solar for the low ionization gas in
both subsystems. The broader OVI phases have a somewhat higher metallicity, and
they are consistent with photoionization; the profiles are not broad enough to
imply production of OVI through collisional ionization. Various models,
including outer disks, dwarf galaxies, and superwinds, are discussed to account
for the phase structure, metallicity, and kinematics of this absorption system.
We favor an interpretation in which the two subsystems are produced by
condensed clouds far out in the opposite extremes of a multi-layer dwarf galaxy
superwind.

show the self-consistent formation of shock fronts of fast magnetosonic type.
They carry density perturbations far away from the wake's center. Shock
formation conditions are identified in sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach number
parameter space. Depending on the wake velocity contrast and magnetic field
magnitude, as well as on the initial perturbation, the emerging shock patterns
can be plane-parallel as well as fully three-dimensionally structured. Similar
large-scale transients could therefore originate at distances far above coronal
helmet streamers or at the location of the ecliptic current sheet.

configuration that is embedded in a uniform flow-aligned magnetic field, is
revisited by means of high resolution two-dimensional (2D) magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations. First, the calculations extend previous studies of
magnetized shear flows to a higher compressibility regime. The nonlinear
evolution of an isolated KH billow emerging from the fastest growing linear
mode for a convective sonic Mach number $M_{cs}=0.7$ layer is in many respects
similar to its less compressible counterpart (Mach $M_{cs}=0.5$). In
particular, the disruptive regime where locally amplified, initially weak
magnetic fields, control the nonlinear saturation process is found for Alfv\'en
Mach numbers $4\simlt M_A \simlt 30$. The most notable difference between
$M_{cs}=0.7$ versus $M_{cs}=0.5$ layers is that higher density contrasts and
fast magnetosonic shocklet structures are observed. Second, the use of adaptive
mesh refinement allows to parametrically explore much larger computational
domains, including up to 22 wavelengths of the linearly dominant mode. A strong
process of large-scale coalescence is found, whatever the magnetic field
regime. It proceeds through continuous pairing/merging events between adjacent
vortices up to the point where the final large-scale vortical structure reaches
the domain dimensions. This pairing/merging process is attributed to the growth
of subharmonic modes and is mainly controlled by relative phase differences
between them. These grid-adaptive simulations demonstrate that even in very
weak magnetic field regimes ($M_A \simeq 30$), the large-scale KH coalescence
process can trigger tearing-type reconnection events previously identified in
cospatial current-vortex sheets.

modern societies and the survival of biological species. Biological evolution
has generated a rich variety of successful solutions, which have inspired
engineers to design optimized artificial systems. Foraging ants, for example,
form attractive trails that support the exploitation of initially unknown food
sources in almost the minimum possible time. However, can this strategy cope
with bottleneck situations, when interactions cause delays that reduce the
overall flow? Here, we present an experimental study of ants confronted with
two alternative routes. We find that pheromone-based attraction generates one
trail at low densities, whereas at a high level of crowding, another trail is
established before traffic volume is affected, which guarantees that an optimal
rate of food return is maintained. This bifurcation phenomenon is explained by
a nonlinear modelling approach. Surprisingly, the underlying mechanism is based
on inhibitory interactions. It implies capacity reserves, a limitation of the
density-induced speed reduction, and a sufficient pheromone concentration for
reliable trail perception. The balancing mechanism between cohesive and
dispersive forces appears to be generic in natural, urban and transportation
systems.

large number of fine-tunings we seem to have, and how they may be clues,
focusing on how the fine-tuning of M$_{Z}$ and m$_{h}$ suggest the MSSM needs
to be extended as the low scale theory, and on how flavor physics may be a
powerful probe of string theory. Finally we examine using benchmark models to

naturally in the context of wave equations in the black hole background. For a
given black hole there are two closely related surfaces. One is the Riemann
surface of complexified ``tortoise'' coordinate. The other Riemann surface
appears when the radial wave equation is interpreted as the Fuchsian
differential equation. We study these surfaces in detail for the BTZ and
Schwarzschild black holes in four and higher dimensions. Topologically, in all
cases both surfaces are a sphere with a set of marked points; for BTZ and 4D
Schwarzschild black holes there is 3 marked points. In certain limits the
surfaces can be characterized very explicitly. We then show how properties of
the wave equation (quasi-normal modes) in such limits are encoded in the
geometry of the corresponding surfaces. In particular, for the Schwarzschild
black hole in the high damping limit we describe the Riemann surface in
question and use this to derive the quasi-normal mode frequencies with the
log(3) as the real part. We then argue that the surfaces one finds this way
signal an appearance of an effective string. We propose that a description of
this effective string propagating in the black hole background can be given in
terms of the Liouville theory living on the corresponding Riemann surface. We
give such a stringy description for the Schwarzschild black hole in the limit
of high damping and show that the quasi-normal modes emerge naturally as the
poles in 3-point correlation function in the effective conformal theory.

with regular boundary $\Gamma=\partial M$. The space $\CM$ of self-adjoint
extensions of the covariant Laplacian on $M$ is shown to have interesting
geometrical and topological properties which are related to the different
topological closures of $M$. In this sense, the change of topology of $M$ is
connected with the non-trivial structure of $\CM$. The space $\CM$ itself can
be identified with the unitary group $\CU(L^2(\Gamma,\C^N))$ of the Hilbert
space of boundary data $L^2(\Gamma,\C^N)$. A particularly interesting family of
boundary conditions, identified as the set of unitary operators which are
singular under the Cayley transform, $\CC_-\cap \CC_+$ (the Cayley manifold),
turns out to play a relevant role in topology change phenomena. The singularity
of the Cayley transform implies that some energy levels, usually associated
with edge states, acquire an infinity energy when by an adiabatic change the
boundary condition reaches the Cayley submanifold $\CC_-$. In this sense
topological transitions require an infinite amount of quantum energy to occur,
although the description of the topological transition in the space $\CM$ is
smooth. This fact has relevant implications in string theory for possible
scenarios with joint descriptions of open and closed strings. In the particular
case of elliptic self--adjoint boundary conditions, the space $\CC_-$ can be
identified with a Lagrangian submanifold of the infinite dimensional
Grassmannian. The corresponding Cayley manifold $\CC_-$ is dual of the Maslov
class of $\CM$.

In regime of the fermion densities typical for normal particle physics, the
primordial fermions split into three families identified with regular fermions.
When fermion energy density becomes comparable with dark energy density, the
theory allows new type of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy
Physics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of solutions of the field theory
equations describing FRW universe filled by homogeneous scalar field and
uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Neutrinos in CLEP state are
drawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their own
parameters. One of the features of the fermions in CLEP state is that in the
late time universe their masses increase as a^{3/2} (a=a(t) is the scale
factor). The energy density of the cold dark matter consisting of neutrinos in
CLEP state scales as a sort of dark energy; this cold dark matter possesses
negative pressure and for the late time universe its equation of state
approaches that of the cosmological constant. The total energy density of such
universe is less than it would be in the universe free of fermionic matter at
all. The (quintessence) scalar field is coupled to dark matter but its coupling
to regular fermionic matter appears to be extremely strongly suppressed.

further interesting models were found to lead to orthogonal polynomial

substantial technical machinery and heavy tools from various parts of
mathematics, in particular complex analysis, combinatorics and variational

developed to rationalize the intuitive methods that are constantly employed. It
is shown that unlike mechanical units that appear in the basis of the space,
the reduced temperature and Boltzmann parameter cannot be described by the
basis set individually and can only be described as a product. Further, the
definition and determination of temperature is dependent on theory and not on
standard mechanical units. It is shown that there is no reason to reduce the
number of degrees of freedom in temperature determination via equipartition
since stochastic variables are involved, and this observation is significant in
that the temperature variable reported in simulation studies would have a
discrepancy to the extent of using the decreased number of freedom, which is
most cases is not large nor significant. The standard assignments used in
reduced units do not lead to errors because operationally the resulting reduced
temperature parameter represents the reduced product of the temperature and
Boltzmann parameters. The non-independence of these quantities explains why
entropy and other associated functions cannot be calculated directly, but are
always scaled in dimensionless increments of the Boltzmann parameter.

has been a notorious theoretical/mathematical problem. In this paper we report
our successful calculation on the properties of this gene regulatory network.
We believe it is of its first kind. Our success is of course built upon
numerous previous theoretical attempts, but following 3 features make our
modeling uniqu:
  1) A new modeling method particular suitable for stability and robustness
study;
  2) Paying a close attention to the well-known difference of in vivo and in

  3) Allowing more important role for noise and stochastic effect to play.

into a cancer cell through the acquisition of mutations. We reduce the
complexities of cancer progression to a simple set of underlying rules that

derive an ordinary differential equation model that explores how the balance of
angiogenesis, cell death rates, genetic instability, and replication rates give
rise to different kinetics in the development of cancer. The key predictions of
the model are that cancer develops fastest through a particular ordering of
mutations and that mutations in genes that maintain genomic integrity would be
the most deleterious type of mutations to inherit. In addition, we perform a
sensitivity analysis on the parameters included in the model to determine the
probable contribution of each. This paper presents a novel approach to viewing

edges of the stairs in the universal ladder of rapid mortality adjustment to

demonstrate new kind of stepwise adaptation. The law proves that universal
mortality is an evolutionary byproduct, which at any age is reversible,
independent of previous life history, and may be disposable. Recent experiments
verify these predictions. Life expectancy may be extended, arguably to
immortality, by relatively small and universal biological amendments in the
animals. Indeed, it doubled with improving conditions in humans; increased
2.4-fold with genotype change in Drosophila, and 6-fold (to 430 years in human

optical pumping and spontaneous emission of a photon by the atom. Spontaneous
emission in a random direction is the dissipative mechanism required to remove
entropy from the atom. However, alternative cooling methods have been proposed
for a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity; the role of
spontaneous emission is replaced by the escape of a photon from the cavity.
Application of such cooling schemes would improve the performance of atom
cavity systems for quantum information processing. Furthermore, as cavity
cooling does not rely on spontaneous emission, it can be applied to systems
that cannot be laser-cooled by conventional methods; these include molecules
(which do not have a closed transition) and collective excitations of Bose
condensates, which are destroyed by randomly directed recoil kicks. Here we
demonstrate cavity cooling of single rubidium atoms stored in an intracavity
dipole trap. The cooling mechanism results in extended storage times and
improved localization of atoms. We estimate that the observed cooling rate is
at least five times larger than that produced by free-space cooling methods,
for comparable excitation of the atom.

notion of generalized entanglement [Barnum et al. Phys. Rev. A 68, 032308
(2003)] by focusing on a simple Lie-algebraic measure of purity of a quantum
state relative to an observable set. For the algebra of local observables on
multi-qubit systems, the resulting local purity measure is equivalent to a
recently introduced global entanglement measure [Meyer and Wallach, J. Math.
Phys. 43, 4273 (2002)]. In the condensed-matter setting, the notion of
Lie-algebraic purity is exploited to identify and characterize the quantum
phase transitions present in two exactly solvable models: the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, and the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY model in a
transverse magnetic field. For the latter, we argue that a natural fermionic
observable-set arising after the Jordan-Wigner transformation, better
characterizes the transition than alternative measures based on qubits. This
illustrates the usefulness of going beyond the standard subsystem-based
framework while providing a global disorder parameter for this model. Our
results show how generalized entanglement leads to useful tools for
distinguishing between the ordered and disordered phases in the case of broken
symmetry quantum phase transitions. Additional implications and possible
extensions of concepts to other systems of interest in condensed matter physics
are also discussed.
