information on their atmospheres and evolution. As part of an ongoing program
to investigate this, projected rotation speeds, vsini, are presented for 16
field UCDs (M9V-L7.5V). This doubles the number of L dwarfs for which vsini has
been measured. All targets are found to have vsini between 10 and 40 km/s,
confirming that L dwarfs are rapid rotators. From the random distribution of
the rotation axes, i, one-sided confidence intervals are placed on the rotation
periods of individual object. These are compared with published period data
obtained from photometric monitoring. From this, the period of 31 hrs for the
L0.5 dwarf 2M0746+2000 published by Gelino et al. (2002) may be ruled out as
the rotation period. The period of 11.2 +/- 0.8 hrs for the L1.5 dwarf
2M1145+2317 obtained by Bailer-Jones & Mundt (2001) is plausibly the rotation
period. The inclination of the rotation axis is i = 62-90 deg with an
expectation value of 76 deg. Alternatively the data set a lower limit on the
radius of 0.1 Rsol. Similarly, the period of 2.7 +/- 0.1 hrs for 2M1334+1940 is
the likely rotation period; the inclination is i = 27-44 deg (mean i = 34 deg).
Where no variability or period was detected by the monitoring programs the
likely reason is low contrast surface features. However, in three cases
variability but no period was detected, despite sensitivity to the likely
rotation periods inferred from vsini. This reinforces the `masking hypothesis',
the idea that the evolution of photospheric features obscures regular
modulation of the light curve. As has been previously discussed, a likely
candidate for such features is inhomogeneous dust clouds.

of a precessing neutron star. First, we find that a hydromagnetic (MHD)
coupling between the crust and the core strongly modifies the star's
precessional modes when $t_a\le\sim (T_s\times T_p)^{1/2}$; here $t_a$ is the
Alfven crossing timescale, and $T_s$ and $T_p$ are the star's spin and
precession periods, respectively. We argue that in a precessing pulsar PSR
B1828-11 the restoring MHD stress prevents a free wobble of the crust relative
to the non-precessing core. Instead, the crust and the proton-electron plasma
in the core must precess in unison, and their combined ellipticity determines
the period of precession. Link has recently shown that the neutron superfluid
vortices in the core of PSR B1828-11 cannot be pinned to the plasma; he has
also argued that this lack of pinning is expected if the proton Fermi liquid in
the core is type-I superconductor. In this case, the neutron superfluid is
dynamically decoupled from the precessing motion. The pulsar's precession
decays due to the mutual friction between the neutron superfluid and the plasma
in the core. The decay is expected to occur over tens to hundreds of precession
periods and may be measurable over a human lifetime. Such a measurement would
provide information about the strong n-p interaction in the neutron-star core.
Second, we consider the effect of gravitomagnetic coupling between the neutron
superfluid in the core and the rest of the star and show that this coupling
changes the rate of precession by about 10%. The general formalism developed in
this paper may be useful for other applications.

time dependent, photons move with unit speed along spatial geodesics and the
sideways force experienced by a particle following a spatially straight line is
independent of the velocity. Also gyroscopes moving along spatial geodesics do
not precess (relative to the forward direction). Gyroscopes that follow a

class of heterotic M-theory vacua with SO(10) grand unification group.
Compactification to four dimensions with N = 1 supersymmetry is achieved on a
torus fibered Calabi-Yau 3-fold Z = X / tau_{X} with first homotopy group
pi_{1}(Z) = Z_{2}. Here X is an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau 3-fold which
admits two global sections and tau_{X} is a freely acting involution on X. The
vacua in this class have net number of three generations of chiral fermions in
the observable sector and may contain M5-branes in the bulk space which wrap
holomorphic curves in Z. Vacua with nonvanishing and vanishing instanton
charges in the observable sector are considered. The latter case corresponds to
potentially viable matter Yukawa couplings. Since pi_{1}(Z) = Z_{2}, the grand
unification group can be broken with Z_{2} Wilson lines.
  Realistic free-fermionic models preserve the SO(10) embedding of the Standard
Model spectrum. These models have a stage in their construction which
corresponds to Z_{2} x Z_{2} orbifold compactification of the weakly coupled
10-dimensional heterotic string. This correspondence identifies associated
Calabi-Yau 3-folds which possess the structure of the above Z and X. This, in
turn, allows the above formalism to be used to study heterotic M-theory vacua
associated with realistic free-fermionic models. It is argued how the top quark
Yukawa coupling in these models can be reproduced in the heterotic M-theory
limit.

polarized) abelian varieties A_g and of the moduli space of curves M_g in the
projective space under the theta constant embedding are equal to the top
self-intersection numbers of one half the first Hodge class on them. This
allows us to obtain an explicit formula for the degree of A_g, and an explicit
upper bound for the degree of M_g.
  Knowing the degree of A_g allows us to effectively determine the subvariety
itself, i.e. to effectively obtain all polynomial equations satisfied by theta
constants. Furthermore, combining the bound on the degree of M_g with effective
Nullstellensatz allows us to rewrite the Kadomtsev-Petvsiashvili (KP) partial
differential equation as a system of algebraic equations for theta constants,
and thus obtain an effective algebraic solution to the Schottky problem.

2A-involutions of the Monster simple group to the extended E_8 diagram, using
the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOAs). We first consider the
sublattices L of the E_8 lattice obtained by removing one node from the
extended E_8 diagram at each time. We then construct a certain coset (or
commutant) subalgebra U associated with L in the lattice VOA V_{\sqrt{2}E_8}.
There are two natural conformal vectors of central charge 1/2 in U such that
their inner product is exactly the value predicted by Conway. The Griess
algebra of U coincides with the algebra described in Conway's paper. There is a
canonical automorphism of U of order |E_8/L|. Such an automorphism can be
extended to the Leech lattice VOA V_\Lambda and it is in fact a product of two
Miyamoto involutions. In the sequel [LYY] to this article we shall develop the
representation theory of $U$. It is expected that if U is actually contained in
the Moonshine VOA V^\natural, the product of two Miyamoto involutions is in the
desired conjugacy class of the Monster simple group.

There are methods of determining which genes have a high probability of

probability densities. Theoretical results have shown such estimation to be
unreliable when high-probability genes are identified.
  The genes that are probably differentially expressed can be found using
decision theory instead of density estimation. Simulations show that the
proposed decision-theoretic method is much more reliable than a
density-estimation method. The proposed method is used to determine which genes
to consider differentially expressed between patients with different types of

  The proposed method determines which genes have a high probability of

microarrays in each of two or more groups of patients or experiments.

This leads to the multiple testing problem: when the number of null hypotheses
is large, the probability of accepting at least one false alternative
hypothesis is often much greater than the significance level of the tests,
which tends to mislead investigators. Software called HighProbability provides
a simple, fast, reliable solution to the multiple testing problem, with
applications to many areas of bioinformatics. For example, in a microarray
study, HighProbability can determine which genes are probably differentially
expressed. Given a set of p-values not adjusted for multiple testing,
HighProbability determines which ones are low enough to imply a high
probability of the truth of their alternative hypotheses. The set of p-values
may be determined by conventional hypothesis testing or by random permutations
using existing R or S-PLUS software. HighProbability is freely available under

currently requires an installation of R or S-PLUS, but the algorithm is short

  paragraph",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP physics.class-ph",,"  The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics constructs the propagator
by evaluating the action S for all classical paths in coordinate space. A
corresponding momentum path integral may also be defined through Fourier
transforms in the endpoints. Although these momentum path integrals are
especially simple for several special cases, no one has, to my knowledge, ever
formally constructed them from all classical paths in momentum space. I show
that this is possible because there exists another classical mechanics based on
an alternate classical action R. Hamilton's Canonical equations result from a
variational principle in both S and R. S uses fixed beginning and ending
spatial points while R uses fixed beginning and ending momentum points. This
alternative action's classical mechanics also includes a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. I also present some important points concerning the beginning and
ending conditions on the action necessary to apply a Canonical transformation.
These properties explain the failure of the Canonical transformation in the
phase space path integral. It follows that a path integral may be constructed
from classical position paths using S in the coordinate representation or from
classical momentum paths using R in the momentum representation. Several
example calculations are presented that illustrate the simplifications and
practical advantages made possible by this broader view of the path integral.
In particular, the normalized amplitude for a free particle is found without
using the Schrodinger equation, the internal spin degree of freedom is simply
and naturally derived, and the simple harmonic oscillator is calculated.
