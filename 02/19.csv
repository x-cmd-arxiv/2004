analysis of these ROSAT data, and a statistical investigation of the
relationship between X-ray and optical properties across the sample. The
steepening of the LX-TX relation in the group regime reported previously is not
seen in our sample, which fits well onto the cluster trend. A number of biases
affect the fitting of regression lines under these circumstances, and until the
impact of these has been thoroughly investigated it seems best to regard the
slope of the group LX-TX relation as being poorly determined. A significant
problem in comparing the properties of groups and clusters is the derivation of
system radii, to allow different systems to be compared within regions having
the same overdensity. We find evidence that group velocity dispersion provides
a very unreliable measure of system mass (and hence radius), with a number of
groups having remarkably low values of sigma. We confirm that the surface
brightness profiles of groups are significantly flatter than those of clusters,
however we find no significant tendency within our sample for cooler groups to
show flatter profiles. This result is inconsistent with simple universal
preheating models. The morphology of the galaxies in the GEMS groups is
correlated to their X-ray properties in a number of ways: we confirm the very
strong relationship between X-ray emission and a dominant early-type central
galaxy, and also find that spiral fraction is correlated with the temperature
of the hot gas. A class of spiral-rich groups with little or no X-ray emission,
probably corresponds to groups which have not yet fully collapsed.

energy within 50 kpc of the centre of an initially isothermal cluster with mass
M_200=3x10^(14) Msol and kT=3.1 keV. We have performed eight simulations with
spherical bubbles of energy generated every 10^8 years, over a total of 1.5

energy loss in the cluster and prevents the accumulation of gas below kT=1 keV
from exceeding the observational limits of 30 Msol/yr. This injection rate is
comparable to the radiated luminosity of the cluster, and the required energy
and periodic timescale of events are consistent with observations of bubbles
produced by central AGN in clusters. The effectiveness of this process depends
primarily on the total amount of injected energy and the initial location of
the bubbles, but is relatively insensitive to the exact duty cycle of events.

the systematic behavior of the HI emission with velocity. The center of the
shell is at (l,b,v)=(23.05,-0.77,+117 km/s). The angular radius of the shell is
6.8', or 15 pc at a distance of 7.8 kpc. The HI mass divided by the volume of
the half-shell implies an average density n_H = 11 +/- 4 cm^{-3} for the medium
in which the shell expanded. The estimated age of GSH23.0-0.7+117 is 1 Myr,
with an upper limit of 2 Myr. The modest expansion energy of 2 * 10^{48} erg
can be provided by the stellar wind of a single O4 to O8 star over the age of
the shell. The 3 sigma upper limit to the 1.4 GHz continuum flux density
(S_{1.4} < 248 mJy) is used to derive an upper limit to the Lyman continuum
luminosity generated inside the shell. This upper limit implies a maximum of
one O9 star (O8 to O9.5 taking into account the error in the distance) inside
the HI shell, unless most of the incident ionizing flux leaks through the HI
shell. To allow this, the shell should be fragmented on scales smaller than the
beam (2.3 pc). If the stellar wind bubble is not adiabatic, or the bubble has
burst (as suggested by the HI channel maps), agreement between the energy and
ionization requirements is even less likely. The limit set by the non-detection
in the continuum provides a significant challenge for the interpretation of
GSH23.0-0.7+117 as a stellar wind bubble. A similar analysis may be applicable
to other Galactic HI shells that have not been detected in the continuum.

produce a sample of 59 L dwarfs and 42 T dwarfs. We compare the near-IR colors
and absolute magnitudes of dwarfs near the L-T transition with predictions made
by models of the distribution and evolution of photospheric condensates. There
is scatter in the spectral indices for L dwarfs, suggesting that these indices
are probing different levels of the atmosphere. The near-IR colors of the L
dwarfs also scatter, likely due to variations in the altitudes, spatial
distributions and thicknesses of the condensate clouds. We identify a group of
late L dwarfs that are blue for their spectral type and that have enhanced FeH,
H2O and KI absorption, possibly due to an unusually small amount of
condensates. The scatter seen in the H-K color for late T dwarfs can be
reproduced by models with a range in surface gravity. The variation is probably
due to the effect on the K-band flux of pressure-induced H2 opacity. The
correlation of H-K color with gravity is supported by the strengths of the
J-band KI doublet. Gravity is closely related to mass for field T dwarfs and
the gravities implied by the H-K colors indicate that the T dwarfs in our

was used to quantitatively evaluate the simulation results. Of the three minima
in the figure-of-merit parameter space, we favor the solution characterized by
an X-ray weak continuum, elevated abundances, a small column density
(log(N_H)\approx 21.4), relatively high ionization parameter (log(U)\approx
-1.2 - -0.2), a wide range of densities (log(n)\approx 7 - 11), and a covering

disk component is optically thick to the continuum, and the SiIII]/CIII] ratio
implies a density of 10^10 - 10^10.25 cm^-3. A low ionization parameter
(log(U)=-3) is inferred for the intermediate-ionization lines, unless the
continuum is ``filtered'' through the wind before illuminating the
intermediate-line emitting gas, in which case log(U)=-2.1. The location of the

during a narrow-band imaging survey of the z=3.1 large-scale structure in the
SSA22 region. Our observations trace the emission halo out to almost 100 kpc
from the sub-millimeter source and identify two distinct Ly-alpha `mini-haloes'
around the nearby Lyman-break galaxies. The main emission region has a broad
line profile, with variations in the line profile seeming chaotic and lacking
evidence for a coherent velocity structure. The data also suggests that
Ly-alpha emission is suppressed around the sub-mm source. Interpretation of the
line structure needs care because Ly-alpha may be resonantly scattered, leading
to complex radiative transfer effects, and we suggest that the suppression in
this region arises because of such effects. We compare the structure of the
central emission-line halo with local counter-parts, and find that the emission
line halo around NGC 1275 in the Perseus cluster may be a good local analogue,
although the high redshift halo is factor of ~100 more luminous and appears to
have higher velocity broadening. Around the Lyman-break galaxy C15, the
emission line is narrower, and a clear shear in the emission wavelength is
seen. A plausible explanation for the line profile is that the emission gas is
expelled from C15 in a bipolar outflow, similar to that seen in M82.

the oldest Classical TTauri star known in the Milky Way (TW Hydrae, with 10

observed values (and ranges of values) for the cluster metallicity, reddening,
distance modulus, and age we compare these data to recent alpha-enhanced
stellar evolution models for low mass metal-poor stars. We describe several
methods of making comparisons between theoretical and observed luminosity
functions in order to isolate the evolutionary timescale information the
luminosity functions contain. We find no significant evidence of excesses of
stars on the red giant branch, although the morphology of the subgiant branch
in the observed luminosity function does not match theoretical predictions in a
satisfactory way. Current uncertainties in Teff-color transformations (and
possibly also in other physics inputs to the models) make more detailed
conclusions about the subgiant branch morphology impossible. Given the recent
constraints on cluster ages from the WMAP experiment (Spergel et al. 2003), we
find that good fitting models that do not include He diffusion (both
color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions) are too old (by
approximately 1-2 Gyr) to adequately represent the cluster luminosity function.
The inclusion of helium diffusion in the models provides an age reduction
(compared to non-diffusive models) that is consistent with the age of the

between tunneling electrons and localized spin S then leads to the peak at
Larmor frequency in the power spectrum of the electric current fluctuations
$I^2_{\omega}$. The elevated noise in the current spectrum will be spatially
localized near the magnetic site. The difference in the power spectra taken at
the Larmor frequency and elsewhere would reveal the peak in the spectrum. We
argue that signal to noise ratio for this mechanism is on the order one. In
addition we discuss the asymmetric lineshapes observed regularly with this
measurement. We show that such lineshapes are in accordance to the random
sampling done with the tunneling electrons. Yet, this predicts a linewidth at

likely to be due to electrostatic repulsion between the tunneling electrons and

subject of intensive studies in recent years. From the experimental viewpoint,
a characteristic feature of this FMR is that some specimens show single
resonance, whereas others show double resonance. Moreover, double resonance can
exhibit a regular pattern, in which the high-field (HF) line intensity
surpasses that of the low-field (LF) line, or it can exhibit an inverted
pattern with the HF line less intense than the LF line. There is a general
belief that the inverted FMR pattern occurs when the HF line is an ""optic
mode"", i.e. an out-of-phase composition of individual sublayer modes, and the
LF line is an ""acoustic mode"", or an in-phase mode composition. The existing
theoretical explanations of bilayer ferromagnetic resonance are, as a rule,
based on phenomenological equation of motion of the magnetization vector. In
this paper, we propose a theory of FMR in ultrathin bilayers based on an
entirely microscopic approach, using the Heisenberg model of localized spins
and assuming that the two ferromagnetic sublayers are exchange-coupled through
their interface. This rigorous microscopic FMR theory does explain the inverted
pattern of the bilayer FMR spectrum by assuming the HF line to correspond to an
in-phase mode, but of interface-localized nature; this gives a possibility to
explore the HF resonance line corresponding to the interface-localized mode as
a potential source of information concerning the bilayer interface.

energetic systems, microphase separation remains a very rare phenomenon in
entropic systems. In this paper, we present a density functional approach to
study the possibility of entropy-driven microphase separation in diblock
copolymers. Our model system consists of copolymers composed of freely-jointed
slender hard rods. The two types of monomeric segments have comparable lengths,
but a significantly different diameter, the latter difference providing the
driving force for the phase separation. At the same time these systems can also
exhibit liquid crystalline phases. We treat this system in the appropriate
generalization of the Onsager approximation to chain-like particles. Using a
linear stability (bifurcation) analysis, we analytically determine the onset of
the microseparated and the nematic phases for long chains. We find that for
very long chains the microseparated phase always preempts the nematic. In the
limit of infinitely long chains, the correlations within the chain become
Gaussian and the approach becomes exact. This allows us to define a Gaussian
limit in which the theory strongly simplifies and the competition between
microphase separation and liquid crystal formation can be studied essentially
analytically. Our main results are phase diagrams as a function of the
effective diameter difference, the segment composition and the length ratio of
the segments. We also determine the amplitude of the positional order as a
function of position along the chain at the onset of the microphase separation
instability. Finally, we give suggestions as to how this type of
entropy-induced microphase separation could be observed experimentally.

is the Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) of how to awaken a set of ``asleep'' robots, by
having an awakened robot move to their locations. Once a robot is awake, it can
assist in awakening other slumbering robots.The objective is to have all robots
awake as early as possible. While the FTP bears some resemblance to problems
from areas in combinatorial optimization such as routing, broadcasting,
scheduling, and covering, its algorithmic characteristics are surprisingly
different. We consider both scenarios on graphs and in geometric
environments.In graphs, robots sleep at vertices and there is a length function
on the edges. Awake robots travel along edges, with time depending on edge
length. For most scenarios, we consider the offline version of the problem, in
which each awake robot knows the position of all other robots. We prove that
the problem is NP-hard, even for the special case of star graphs. We also
establish hardness of approximation, showing that it is NP-hard to obtain an
approximation factor better than 5/3, even for graphs of bounded degree.These
lower bounds are complemented with several positive algorithmic results,
including: (1) We show that the natural greedy strategy on star graphs has a
tight worst-case performance of 7/3 and give a polynomial-time approximation
scheme (PTAS) for star graphs. (2) We give a simple O(log D)-competitive online
algorithm for graphs with maximum degree D and locally bounded edge weights.

a new static solution for the Einstein equation with a negative cosmological
constant, which we call the deformed black hole. We derive a solution for a
static and axisymmetric perturbation of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black
hole that is regular in the range from the horizon to spacelike infinity. The
key result is that this perturbation simultaneously deforms the two boundary
surfaces--i.e., both the horizon and spacelike two-surface at infinity. Then we
discuss the Abbott-Deser mass and the Ashtekar-Magnon one for the deformed
black hole, and according to the Ashtekar-Magnon definition, we construct the
thermodynamic first law of the deformed black hole. The first law has a
correction term which can be interpreted as the work term that is necessary for
the deformation of the boundary surfaces. Because the work term is negative,
the horizon area of the deformed black hole becomes larger than that of the
Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole, if compared under the same mass,
indicating that the quasistatic deformation of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter
black hole may be compatible with the thermodynamic second law (i.e., the area
theorem).

consistently correlate these decays with the radiative B-meson decays (b->

high-energy and low-energy FCNC decay modes in the MSSM parameter space. Our
calculation shows that the available data on B(b->s \gamma) severely restricts
the allowed values of B(h->b\bar{s}). While the latter could reach a few
percent level in fine-tuned scenarios, the requirement of naturalness reduces
these FCNC rates into the modest range B(h->b\bar{s}) ~ 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. We
find that the bulk of the MSSM contribution to B(h->b\bar{s}) could originate
from the strong supersymmetric sector. The maximum value of the FCNC rates
obtained in this paper disagree significantly with recent (over-)estimates
existing in the literature. Our results are still encouraging because they show
that the FCNC modes h->b\bar{s} can be competitive with other Higgs boson
signatures and could play a helpful complementary role to identify the

between the event rate in the Homestake experiment and its theoretical
prediction and the absence of the electron spectrum upturn in SuperKamiokande

questions in the context of resonant spin flavour precession to sterile

radiation/lower convection zone. We consider the simplest such model beyond the
standard 2$\nu$ flavour LMA one, with one single magnetic moment transition
between active and sterile state and vanishing vacuum mixing. The preferred
mass square difference is $\Delta m^2_{10}=O(10^{-8}eV^2)$. The Ga rate appears
to be the most sensitive of all to solar activity. It is also found that a
field profile extending within a longer region in the radial direction is
favoured over another with a shorter span, and leads to a stronger suppression
than in the LMA case of the intermediate energy neutrinos and some of the $^8
B$ ones.

appearance measurement in LBL.. Assuming \sim 10^{3} GW_{th} ton year operation
of a reactor experiment, CP sensitivity at 90 % CL is shown to exists in

oscillatory pattern of neutrino oscillation. Motivated by the approval of the

strategy. It is meant to measure neutrino oscillation at the first and the
second oscillation maxima by two HKs placed at Kamioka and somewhere in Korea.
It is suggested by very rough argument that 8 years running in nu_{e} and

oscillators for relativistic bound states, instead of Feynman diagrams. His

Rev. D, Vol. 3, 2706 (1971)]. These authors noted that the hadron mass spectra
can be predicted by the degeneracy of the three-dimensional harmonic
oscillators. In so doing, they started with the Lorentz-invariant differential
equation for the harmonic oscillator, and obtained Lorentz invariant solutions.
However, their solutions are not normalizable in the time-separation variable
and cannot carry probability interpretation. It is pointed out that there are
solutions normalizable in the time-separation variable within the framework of
Wigner's little-group representation of the Poincar\'e group. These solutions
are not invariant but covariant under Lorentz transformations. These solutions
give a covariant bound-state model which gives the quark model and the parton
model as two different limiting cases, in the low- and high-speed limits
respectively.

(m_\mu / m_e) $ is 132.6823 (72), which supersedes the old value 127.50 (41).
The new value of the three-mass term $A_3^{(8)} (m_\mu / m_e, m_\mu / m_\tau) $
is 0.0376 (1). The term $A_2^{(8)} (m_\mu / m_\tau) $ is crudely estimated to
be about 0.005 and may be ignored for now. The total QED contribution to
$a_\mu$ is $116 584 719.58 (0.02)(1.15)(0.85) \times 10^{-11}$, where 0.02 and
1.15 are uncertainties in the $\alpha^4$ and $\alpha^5$ terms and 0.85 is from
the uncertainty in $\alpha$ measured by atom interferometry. This raises the
Standard Model prediction by $13.9 \times 10^{-11}$, or about 1/5 of the
measurement uncertainty of $a_\mu$. It is within the noise of current
uncertainty ($\sim 100 \times 10^{-11}$) in the estimated hadronic
contributions to $a_\mu$.

of the quark-antiquark bound states in going down in the chirally restored
phase from the so-called ""zero binding points"" $T_{zb}$ to the QCD critical
temperature $T_c$ at which the Nambu-Goldstone and Wigner-Weyl modes meet. In
doing this, we adopt the idea recently introduced by Shuryak and Zahed for
charmed $\bar c c$, light-quark $\bar q q$ mesons $\pi, \sigma, \rho, A_1$ and
gluons that at $T_{zb}$, the quark-antiquark scattering length goes through
$\infty$ at which conformal invariance is restored, thereby transforming the
matter into a near perfect fluid behaving hydrodynamically, as found at RHIC.
We name this new state of matter as ""sticky molasses"". We show that the binding
of these states is accomplished by the combination of (i) the color Coulomb
interaction, (ii) the relativistic effects, and (iii) the interaction induced
by the instanton-anti-instanton molecules. The spin-spin forces turned out to
be small. While near $T_{zb}$ all mesons are large-size nonrelativistic objects
bound by Coulomb attraction, near $T_c$ they get much more tightly bound, with
many-body collective interactions becoming important and making the $\sigma$
and $\pi$ masses approach zero (in the chiral limit). The wave function at the
origin grows strongly with binding, and the near-local four-Fermi interactions
induced by the instanton molecules play an increasingly more important role as
the temperature moves downward toward $T_c$.

is based on a neural network and the Bayesian interpretation of the network
output as a posteriori probabability. The network is trained using example
events from history or simulation, which define the underlying probability
density f(t,x).
  Once trained, the network is applied on new, unknown examples x, for which it
can predict the probability distribution of the target variable t.
Event-by-event knowledge of the smooth function f(t|x) can be very useful, e.g.
in maximum likelihood fits or for forecasting tasks. No assumptions are
necessary about the distribution, and non-Gaussian tails are accounted for
automatically. Important quantities like median, mean value, left and right
standard deviations, moments and expectation values of any function of t are
readily derived from it.
  The algorithm can be considered as an event-by-event unfolding and leads to
statistically optimal reconstruction. The largest benefit of the method lies in
complicated problems, when the measurements x are only relatively weakly
correlated to the output t. As to assure optimal generalisation features and to
avoid overfitting, the networks are regularised by extended versions of weight
decay. The regularisation parameters are determined during the online-learning
of the network by relations obtained from Bayesian statistics.
  Some toy Monte Carlo tests and first real application examples from
high-energy physics and econometry are discussed.

factors not related to the population itself, and a dynamic one that accounts
for interactions between organisms, e.g. competition. The effects of finiteness
of population size on survival of coexisting species are also accounted for.
The simulations show that both in the case of flat and ripid static fitness
landscapes, competition and assortativity do exert a synergistic effect on

quantum information protocols such as teleportation, logic-gate teleportation,

from the combination of the --apparently purely qualitative-- structures of

C(I,I), where C is the category and I is the tensor unit, in order to perform
various protocols such as teleportation. Our formalism captures both the
information-flow aspect of the protocols (see quant-ph/0402014), and the
branching due to quantum indeterminism. This contrasts with the standard
accounts, in which the classical information flows are `outside' the usual

standard and Bohmian quantum mechanics, at the individual level of pair of
particles. Meantime, the two theories present the same predictions at the
ensemble level of particles. Regarding quantum information theory, two
theoretical quantum communication schemes including quantum dense coding and
quantum teleportation schemes have been proposed by using entangled spatial
states of two EPR particles shared between two parties. It is shown that the
rate of classical information gain in our dense coding scheme is greater than
some previously proposed multi-qubit protocols by a logarithmic factor
dependent on the dimension of Hilbert space. The proposed teleportation scheme
can provide a complete wave function teleportation of an object having other
degrees of freedom in our three-dimensional space, for the first time. All

Although under most circumstances dissipation leads to an increase in entropy
(or a decrease in purity) of the system, there is an important class of
problems for which dissipation with external control can decrease the entropy
(or increase the purity) of the system. An important example is laser cooling.
In such systems, there is an interplay of the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics,
which is controllable and the dissipative part of the dynamics, which is
uncontrollable. The strategy is to control the Hamiltonian portion of the
evolution in such a way that the dissipation causes the purity of the system to
increase rather than decrease. The goal of this paper is to find the strategy
that leads to maximal purity at the final time. Under the assumption that
Hamiltonian control is complete and arbitrarily fast, we provide a general
framework by which to calculate optimal cooling strategies. These assumptions
lead to a great simplification, in which the control problem can be
reformulated in terms of the spectrum of eigenvalues of $\rho$, rather than
$\rho$ itself. By combining this formulation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
theorem we are able to obtain an equation for the globaly optimal cooling
strategy in terms of the spectrum of the density matrix. For the three-level
$\Lambda$ system, we provide a complete analytic solution for the optimal
cooling strategy. For this system it is found that the optimal strategy does
not exploit system coherences and is a 'greedy' strategy, in which the purity
is increased maximally at each instant.

bath is studied with the purpose of elucidating the differences between the
relaxation to a spin bath and to a harmonic bath. Converged results are
obtained for the spin bath by the Surrogate Hamiltonian approach. This method
is based on constructing a system-bath Hamiltonian, with a finite but large
number of spin bath modes, that mimics exactly a bath with an infinite number
of modes for a finite time interval. Convergence with respect to the number of
simultaneous excitations of bath modes can be checked. The results are compared
to calculations that include a finite number of harmonic modes carried out by
using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method of Nest and Meyer,
[J. Chem. Phys. 119, 24 (2003)]. In the weak coupling regime, at zero
temperature and for small excitations of the primary system, both methods
converge to the Markovian limit. When initially the primary system is
significantly excited, the spin bath can saturate restricting the energy
acceptance. An interaction term between bath modes that spreads the excitation
eliminates the saturation. The loss of phase between two cat states has been
analyzed and the results for the spin and harmonic baths are almost identical.
For stronger couplings, the dynamics induced by the two types of baths deviate.
The accumulation and degree of entanglement between the bath modes have been
characterized. Only in the spin bath the dynamics generate entanglement between
the bath modes.
