examine high-resolution optical spectra of the NaD lines resolving the velocity
structure along the line of sight. We find this to be complex, with at least
nine components, mostly blue-shifted, spanning a velocity range of nearly
200km/s. The presence of components with a large blue-shift rules out a nearby
location and requires that the binary be located at or beyond the tangent
point, implying a lower limit to the distance of ~6kpc. The presence of a
significant red-shifted component at +30km/s is even more intriguing as GX339-4
also has a slightly positive systemic velocity, suggesting that the source, and
this cloud, could be on the far side of the Galaxy, where the radial velocities
due to Galactic rotation become positive again. If this is the case, we require
a distance of ~15kpc. This is less secure than the 6kpc lower limit however. We
discuss the implications of these possible distances for the outburst and
quiescent luminosities, and the nature of the companion star, and argue that a
large distance is consistent with these characteristics. In particular, it
would explain the non-detection of the companion star during the faintest
states.

height above the midplane in the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in the Milky Way and
other galaxies is a natural consequence of the progressive hardening of the
radiation field far from the midplane ionizing sources. To obtain increasing
temperatures and line ratios away from the midplane, our photoionization
simulations of a multi-component interstellar medium do not require as much
additional heating (over and above that from photoionization) as previous
studies that employed one dimensional, spherically averaged models.
  Radiation leaking into the DIG from density bounded H II regions is generally
harder in the H-ionizing continuum and has its He-ionizing photons suppressed
compared to the ionizing source of the H II region. In line with other recent
investigations, we find that such leaky H II region models can provide elevated
temperatures and line ratios, and a lower He+ fraction in the DIG. For a
composite model representing the relative spectral types of O stars in the
solar neighbourhood, we find that additional heating less than 1.0E-26 n_e
ergs/s/cm^3 can reproduce the observed elevated line ratios in the DIG. This
additional heating is considerably less than previous estimates due to the
natural hardening of the radiation field reaching large heights in our
simulations.

massive colliding wind binary HD 152248, which is the brightest X-ray source of
the cluster. The campaign, with a total duration of 180 ksec, was split into
six separate observations, following the orbital motion of HD 152248. The X-ray
flux from this system presents a clear, asymmetric modulation with the phase
and ranges from 0.73 to 1.18 10-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the [0.5-10.0 keV] energy
band. The maximum of the emission is reached slightly after apastron. The EPIC
spectra are quite soft and peak around 0.8-0.9 keV. We characterize their shape
using several combinations of mekal models and power-law spectra and we detect
significant spectral variability in the [0.5-2.5 keV] energy band. We also
perform 2-D hydrodynamical simulations using different sets of parameters that
closely reproduce the physical and orbital configuration of the HD 152248

confrontation of the model predictions with the constraints deduced from the

wind zone, diluted by the softer X-ray contribution of the two O-type stars of
the system. Our simulations also reveal that the interaction region of HD

asymmetric single-lens curve with an isolated, secure data point that is ~0.6
magnitudes brighter than neighboring points separated by a few days. It was
previously suggested that the single deviant data point and global asymmetry
were best explained by a planetary companion to the primary lens with mass
ratio log(q)=-3 to -2, and parallax effects induced by the motion of the Earth.
We revisit the interpretation of OGLE-2002-BLG-055, and show that the data can
be explained by wide variety of models. We find that the deviant data point can
be fit by a large number of qualitatively different binary-lens models whose
mass ratios range, at the ~3-sigma level, from log(q) ~ -4 to -1. This range is
consistent with a planet, brown dwarf, or M-dwarf companion for reasonable
primary masses of M> 0.8 M_sun. A subset of these binary-lens fits consist of a
family of continuously degenerate models whose mass ratios differ by an
order-of-magnitude, but whose light curves differ by <2% for the majority of
the perturbation. The deviant data point can also explained by a binary
companion to the source with secondary/primary flux ratio of ~1%. This model
has the added appeal that the global asymmetry is naturally explained by the
acceleration of the primary induced by the secondary. The binary-source model
yields a measurement of the Einstein ring radius projected on source plane of
\hat r_E=1.87 +/- 0.40 AU. OGLE-2002-BLG-055 is an extreme example that
illustrates the difficulties and degeneracies inherent in the interpretation of

nearby bright star. Most techniques being explored to suppress the halo are
achromatic, with separate correction of diffraction and wavefront errors.
Residual speckle structure may be subtracted by differencing images taken
through narrowband filters, but photon noise remains and ultimately limits
sensitivity. Here we describe two ways to take advantage of narrow bands to
reduce speckle photon flux and to obtain better control of systematic errors.
Multiple images are formed in separate color bands of 5-10% bandwidth, and
recorded by coronagraphic interferometers equipped with active control of
wavefront phase and/or amplitude. In one method, a single deformable pupil
mirror is used to actively correct both diffraction and wavefront components of
the halo. This yields good diffraction suppression for complex pupil
obscuration, with high throughput over half the focal plane. In a second
method, the coronagraphic interferometer is used as a second stage after
conventional apodization. The halo from uncontrollable residual errors in the
pupil mask or wavefront is removed by destructive interference made directly at
the detector focal plane with an ""anti-halo"", synthesized by spatial light
modulators in the reference arm of the interferometer. In this way very deep
suppression may be achieved by control elements with greatly relaxed, and thus
achievable, tolerances. In both examples, systematic errors are minimized
because the planet imaging cameras themselves also provide the error sensing
data.

vertical, transport, thereby complementing and extending numerical simulations.
The azimuthal-vertical component of the magnetic stress is fundamental to an
understanding of disk--corona--outflow coupling: when it is important for
driving the angular momentum transport and mass accretion in the disk, it also
has an important influence on the disk--corona--outflow energy budget. The
Poynting flux derived from the product of this term with the Keplerian velocity
dominates the Poynting flux into the corona. The ratio of the coronal Alfven
velocity to the Keplerian velocity is an important parameter. If this parameter
is greater than unity then energetically significant winds and Poynting flux
into the corona occur. However, significant effects could occur when this
parameter is much less than unity. A limiting solution describing the case of
angular momentum transport solely by the vertical-azimuthal stress features all
of the accretion power being channeled into a wind, some of which would be
dissipated in the corona. More realistic solutions in which there is both
radial and vertical transport of angular momentum would have different
fractions of the accretion power emitted by the disk and corona. These results
have important implications for existing accretion disk theory and for our
interpretation of high-energy emission and nuclear outflows from black holes.

source-I to IRc2 remains ambiguous, we suggest these sources mark a high
density core (10^7-10^8 pc^-3 over 1000 AU) within the larger BN/KL star
forming cluster. The high density may be a consequence of the core being young
and heavily embedded. We suggest the energetics of the BN/KL region may be
dominated by this cluster core rather than one or two individual sources.

suspect that this object is an interacting binary. At slightly lower

tilted with respect to the rotational axis, the geometry of the magnetosphere
and its deformation due to the stellar rotation are determined. The radio
emitting region is determined by the physical conditions of the magnetosphere
and of the stellar wind. Free-free absorption by the thermal plasma trapped in
the inner magnetosphere is also considered. Several free parameters are
involved in the model, such as the size of the emitting region, the energy
spectrum and the number density of the emitting electrons, and the
characteristics of the plasma in the inner magnetosphere. By solving the
equation of radiative transfer, along a path parallel to the line of sight, the
radio brightness distribution and the total flux density as a function of
stellar rotation are computed. As the model is applied to simulate the observed
5 GHz lightcurves of HD37479 and HD37017, several possible magnetosphere
configurations are found. After simulations at other frequencies, in spite of
the large number of parameters involved in the modeling, two solutions in the

spectral indices. The results of our simulations agree with the magnetically
confined wind-shock model in a rotating magnetosphere. The X-ray emission from

the generalized Lyapunov exponents for diagonal correlators of the wave
function, $<\psi^2_{n,\mathbf{m}}>$, can be calculated analytically and
exactly. This permits to determine the phase diagram of the system. For all
dimensions $D > 2$ one finds intervals in the energy and the disorder where
extended and localized states coexist: the metal-insulator transition should
thus be interpreted as a first-order transition. The qualitative differences
permit to group the systems into two classes: low-dimensional systems ($2\leq D
\leq 3$), where localized states are always exponentially localized and
high-dimensional systems ($D\geq D_c=4$), where states with non-exponential
localization are also formed. The value of the upper critical dimension is

of 3He-B is to irradiate with thermal neutrons. The vortices are then formed in
a rapid non-equilibrium process with very distinctive characteristics. Two
models were suggested to explain the phenomenon. One is based on the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect formation in a quench-cooled second order
phase transition. The second model builds on the instability of the moving
front between superfluid and normal 3He, which is created by the heating from
the neutron absorption event. The most detailed measurements with single-vortex
resolution have been performed at temperatures close to Tc. We present an
overview of the main experimental features and demonstrate that the
measurements are consistent with the Kibble-Zurek picture. New data, collected
at low temperatures, support this conclusion, but display superfluid turbulence
as a new phenomenon. Below 0.6 Tc the damping of vortex motion from the normal
component is reduced sufficiently so that turbulent vortex dynamics become
possible. Here a single absorbed neutron may transfer the sample from the
meta-stable vortex-free to the equilibrium vortex state. We find that the
probability for a neutron to initiate such a turbulent transition grows with
increasing superflow velocity and decreasing temperature.

These properties allow to establish, inside a classical geometric framework, a
formal analogy between gravitation and the laws governing the evolution of a
thermodynamic system. The analogy applies to stationary spacetimes admitting
multiple causal horizons as well as to AdS Taub-bolt solutions.

of gravity and its observational consequences. Although, for the illustrative
purposes we focus on a particular simple generally-covariant example, our
conclusions are rather general and apply to large class of theories in which,
already at the Newtonian level, gravity changes the regime at a certain very
large crossover distance $r_c$. In such theories the cosmological evolution
gets dramatically modified at the crossover scale, usually exhibiting a
""self-accelerated"" expansion, which can be differentiated from more
conventional ""dark energy"" scenarios by precision cosmology. However, unlike
the latter scenarios, theories of modified-gravity are extremely constrained
(and potentially testable) by the precision gravitational measurements at much
shorter scales. Despite the presence of extra polarizations of graviton, the
theory is compatible with observations, since the naive perturbative expansion
in Newton's constant breaks down at a certain intermediate scale. This happens
because the extra polarizations have couplings singular in $1/r_c$. However,
the correctly resummed non-linear solutions are regular and exhibit continuous
Einsteinian limit. Contrary to the naive expectation, explicit examples
indicate that the resummed solutions remain valid after the ultraviolet
completion of the theory, with the loop corrections taken into account.

comment on their form in the light of mirror symmetry. That some residue of
mirror symmetry survives into the zeta-functions is suggested by an application
of the Weil conjectures to Calabi-Yau threefolds: the zeta-functions are
rational functions and the degrees of the numerators and denominators are
exchanged between the zeta-functions for the manifold and its mirror. It is
clear nevertheless that the zeta-function, as classically defined, makes an
essential distinction between Kahler parameters and the coefficients of the

modification' of the zeta-function that restores the symmetry between the

[E-S]. (see also [El], [T], and [K-T] for related aspects.) Only much weaker
results or very special cases of this conjecture are presently known. One
approach consists of assuming the sum set $A + A$ small and then deriving that
the product set $AA$ is large (using Freiman's structure theorem). (cf [N-T],
[Na3].) We follow the reverse route and prove that if $|AA| < c|A|$, then
$|A+A| > c^\prime |A|^2$ (see Theorem 1). A quantitative version of this
phenomenon combined with Pl\""unnecke type of inequality (due to Ruzsa) permit
us to settle completely a related conjecture in [E-S] on the growth in $k$. If

Z$ of cardinality $|A| = k$ and where $A[1]$ (respectively, $A\{1\}$) refers to
the simple sum (resp., product) of elements of $A$. (See (0.6), (0.7).) It was
conjectured in [E-S] that $g(k)$ grows faster than any power of $k$ for
$k\to\infty$. We will prove here that $\ell n g(k)\sim\frac{(\ell n k)^2}{\ell
n \ell n k}$ (see Theorem 2) which is the main result of this paper.

random tree is a scaling limit as N tends to infinity of both a critical
Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have total population size N as well as a
uniform random rooted combinatorial tree with N vertices. The Aldous--Broder
algorithm is a Markov chain on the space of rooted combinatorial trees with N
vertices that has the uniform tree as its stationary distribution. We construct
and study a Markov process on the space of all rooted compact real trees that
has the continuum random tree as its stationary distribution and arises as the

and asymmetric solutions. The model has a source species which decays into
left- and right-handed types of monomer, each of which can polymerise to form
homochiral chains; these chains are susceptible to `poisoning' by the opposite
handed monomer. Homochiral polymers are assumed to influence the proportion of
each type of monomer formed from the precursor. We show that for certain
parameter values a positive feedback mechanism makes the symmetric steady-state
solution unstable. The kinetics of polymer formation are then analysed in the
case where the system starts from zero concentrations of monomer and chains. We
show that following a long induction time, extremely large concentrations of
polymers are formed for a short time, during this time an asymmetry introduced
into the system by a random external perturbation may be massively amplified.
The system then approaches one of the steady-state solutions described above.

cerebral cortex make synapses not onto cell bodies but at distal parts of
dendrites of the target neurons, mediating highly nonlinear dendritic
inhibition. We propose a novel form of competitive neural network model that
realizes such dendritic inhibition. Contrary to the conventional lateral
inhibition in neural networks, our dendritic inhibition models don't always
show winner-take-all behaviors; instead, they converge to ""I don't know"" states
when unknown input patterns are presented. We derive reduced two-dimensional
dynamics for the network, showing that a drastic shift of the fixed point from
a winner-take-all state to an ""I don't know"" state occurs in accordance with
the increase in noise added to the stored patterns. By preventing
misrecognition in such a way, dendritic inhibition networks achieve fine
pattern discrimination, which could be one of the basic computations by
inhibitory connected recurrent neural networks in the brain.

  in Biopolymers",,,"SPhT-T04/014","q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft",,"  The Poland-Scheraga (PS) model for the helix-coil transition of DNA considers
the statistical mechanics of the binding (or hybridization) of two
complementary strands of DNA of equal length, with the restriction that only
bases with the same index along the strands are allowed to bind. In this paper,
we extend this model by relaxing these constraints: We propose a generalization
of the PS model which allows for the binding of two strands of unequal lengths
$N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ with unrelated sequences. We study in particular (i) the
effect of mismatches on the hybridization of complementary strands (ii) the
hybridization of non complementary strands (as resulting from point mutations)
of unequal lengths $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$. The use of a Fixman-Freire scheme
scales down the computational complexity of our algorithm from
$O(N_{1}^{2}N_{2}^{2})$ to $O(N_{1}N_{2})$.The simulation of complementary
strands of a few kbps yields results almost identical to the PS model. For
short strands of equal or unequal lengths, the binding displays a strong
sensitivity to mutations. This model may be relevant to the experimental
protocol in DNA microarrays, and more generally to the molecular recognition of
DNA fragments. It also provides a physical implementation of sequence
alignments.

it in the Eisert scheme.
  The criteria adopted in this work to classify quantum games are the amount
and characteristics of Nash equilibria and Pareto-optimal positions. A new
classification based on them is developed for symmetric nonzero-sum classical
2x2 games, as well as classifications for quantum games with different
restricted subsets of the total strategy set. Finally, a classification is
presented taking the whole set of strategies into account, both unitary
strategies and nonunitary strategies studied as convex mixures of unitary
strategies.
  The classification reproduces features which have been previously found in
other works, like appearance of multiple equilibria, changes in the character
of equilibria, and entanglement regime transitions.

the Hilbert space is invariant under rotation to exclude other symmetries which

Negative group velocity as low as -c/10^6=-80 m/s is recorded. We also find

at least a great step forward towards a solution of the quantum measurement
problem. It is shown here however that in the cases in which a sentient being
is explicitly assumed to take cognizance of the outcome the reasons we have for
judging this way are not totally consistent, so that the question has to be
considered anew. It is pointed out that the way the Broglie-Bohm model solves
the riddle suggests a possible clue, consisting in assuming that even very
simple systems may have some sort of a proto-consciousness, but that their
``internal states of consciousness'' are not predictive. It is, next, easily
shown that if we imagine the systems get larger, in virtue of decoherence their
internal states of consciousness progressively gain in predictive value. So
that, for macro-systems, they may be identified (in practice) with the
predictive states of consciousness on which we ground our observational
predictions. The possibilities of carrying over this idea to standard quantum
mechanics are then investigated. Conditions of conceptual consistency are
considered and found rather strict, and, finally, two solutions emerge,
differing conceptually very much from one another but in both of which the,
possibly non-predictive, generalized internal states of consciousness play a
crucial role.

(BSO), which depends on the initial phase of the driving field. This
oscillation may restrict the precise rotation of a qubit made of direct

rotation of a qubit made of such a lambda system when compared to a direct
