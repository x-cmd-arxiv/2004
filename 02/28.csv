show that it is a pre-main sequence (PMS) low-mass star with a weak NIR excess.
This genuine T Tauri star displayed an X-ray flare with an unusual long rise
phase (~8h). The X-ray emission was nearly constant during the first 18h of the
observation, and then increased by a factor of 13 during a fast rise phase
(~2h), and reached a factor of 16 above the quiescent X-ray level at the end of
a gradual phase (~6h) showing a slower rise. To our knowledge this flare, with
\~0.4-~0.5 cts/s, has the highest count rate observed so far with Chandra from
a PMS low-mass star. By chance, the source position, 8.2' off-axis, protected
this observation from pile-up. We make a spectral analysis of the X-ray
emission versus time, showing that the plasma temperature of the quiescent
phase and the flare peak reaches 29MK and 88MK, respectively. The quiescent and
flare luminosities in the energy range 0.5--8keV corrected from absorption

the quiescent X-ray luminosity on the LkHA312 bolometric luminosity is very
high with log(L_X/L_bol)= -2.9, implying that the corona of LkHA312 reached the

much of modern astrophysics. In this review the relation between interstellar
turbulence and star formation is discussed. Supersonic turbulence can provide
support against gravitational collapse on global scales, while at the same time
it produces localized density enhancements that allow for collapse on small
scales. The efficiency and timescale of stellar birth in Galactic gas clouds
strongly depend on the properties of the interstellar turbulent velocity field,
with slow, inefficient, isolated star formation being a hallmark of turbulent
support, and fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurring in its
absence. Star formation on scales of galaxies as a whole is expected to be
controlled by the balance between gravity andturbulence, just like star
formation on scales of individual interstellar gas clouds, but may be modulated
by additional effects like cooling and differential rotation. The dominant
mechanism for driving interstellar turbulence in star-forming regions of
galactic disks appears to be supernovae explosions. In the outer disk of our
Milky Way or in low-surface brightness galaxies the coupling of rotation to the
gas through magnetic fields or gravity may become important.

emitting synchrotron radiation in the optical band. We propose a scenario in
which the jet and the X-ray corona are fed by the same energy reservoir where
large amounts of accretion power are stored before being channelled into either
the jet or the high energy radiation. This time dependent model reproduces the
main features of the rapid multi-wavelength variability of XTE J1118+480.
Assuming that the energy is stored in the form of magnetic field, we find that
the required values of the model parameters are compatible with both a patchy
corona atop a cold accretion disc and a hot thick inner disc geometry. The
range of variability timescales for the X-ray emitting plasma are consistent
with the dynamical times of an accretion flow between 10 and 100 Schwarzschild
radii. On the other hand, the derived range of timescales associated with the
dissipation in the jet extends to timescales more than 10 times larger,
confirming the suggestion that the generation of a powerful outflow requires
large scale coherent poloidal field structures. A strong requirement of the
model is that the total jet power should be at least a few times larger than
the observed X-ray luminosity. This would be consistent with the overall low
radiative efficiency of the source. We present independent arguments showing
that the jet probably dominates the energetic output of all accreting black
holes in the low-hard state.

contain accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We review the current
observational evidence for IMBH-ULXs. While low-luminosity ULXs with L_X <~
10^39.5 erg/s (assuming isotropic emission) are consistent with mildly X-ray
beamed high-mass X-ray binaries, there are a considerable number of ULXs with
larger X-ray luminosities that are not easily explained by these models. Recent
high-S/N XMM X-ray spectra are showing an increasing number of ULXs with ``cool
disks'' -- accretion disks with multi-color blackbody inner disk temperatures
kT_in ~ 0.1-0.2 keV, consistent with accreting IMBHs. Optical emission-line
studies of ULX nebulae provide useful measurements of X-ray energetics, and can
thus determine if the X-rays are emitted isotropically. Analysis of an optical
spectrum of the Ho II ULX nebulae implies an X-ray energy source with ~10^40
erg/s is present, suggesting an isotropically-emitting IMBH. The spatial
coincidence of ULXs with dense star clusters (young clusters and globular
clusters) suggests that IMBHs formed in these clusters could be the compact
objects in the associated ULXs. Quasi-periodic oscillations and frequency
breaks in XMM power-density spectra of ULXs also suggest that the black hole
masses are more consistent with IMBHs than stellar-mass black holes. Since
_all_ of these ULXs with evidence for IMBHs are high-luminosity ULXs, i.e., L_X
>~ 10^40 ergs, we suggest that this class of ULXs is generally powered by
accreting IMBHs.

evaluate the possible impact that incompleteness has on comparisons with
substructure models by estimating corrections to the known number of dwarfs
using empirical and theoretical models. If we assume that the true distribution
of Milky Way satellites is uniform with latitude, then we estimate a 33%
incompleteness in the total number of dwarfs due to obscuration at low
latitude. Similarly, if we suppose that the radial distribution of Milky Way
satellites matches that of M31, or that of the oldest sub-halos or the most
massive sub-halos in a simulation, we estimate a total number of Milky Way
dwarfs ranging from 1 -- 3 times the known population. Although the true level
of incompleteness is quite uncertain, the fact that our extrapolations yield
average total numbers of MW dwarfs that are realistically 1.5 -- 2 times the
known population, shows that incompleteness needs to be taken seriously when
comparing to models of dwarf galaxy formation. Interestingly, the radial
distribution of the oldest sub-halos in a Lambda+CDM simulation of a Milky
Way-like galaxy possess a close match to the observed distribution of M31's
satellites, which suggests that reionization may be an important factor
controlling the observability of sub-halos. We also assess the prospects for a
new SDSS search for Milky Way satellites to constrain the possible

material that is transferred from the red giant to the WD forms a disk around
the WD. Thus, symbiotic stars are a bit like overgrown cataclysmic variables

understood as CVs, in part because their longer variability time scales mean
that observations over many years are required to cover different outburst
states and orbital phases. The recent discovery of collimated outflows (""jets"")

of these objects. Astrophysical jets are observed in almost every type of

resonant modes. When one of these modes dominates, the acceleration rate is
reduced considerably. At low energies, this happens for $^4$He, but not for
$^3$He where contributions from the two stronger modes are comparable so that
acceleration of $^3$He is very efficient. As a result, the acceleration of
$^4$He is suppressed by a barrier below $\sim 100$ keV nucleon$^{-1}$ and there
is a prominent quasi-thermal component in the $^4$He spectra, while almost all
the injected $^3$He ions are accelerated to high energies. This accounts for
the large enrichment of $^3$He at high energies observed in impulsive solar
energetic particle events. With reasonable plasma parameters this also provides
a good fit to the spectra of both ions. Beyond $\sim 1$ MeV nucleon$^{-1}$, the
spectrum of $^3$He is softer than that of $^4$He, which is consistent with the

accelerating form recently observed and is in excellent quantitative agreement

basic laws that operate in a spacetime that has no unique division into space

models of information gathering and utilizing systems (IGUSes). Past, present,
and future are not properties of four-dimensional spacetime but notions
describing how individual IGUSes process information. Their origin is to be
found in how these IGUSes evolved or were constructed. The past, present, and
future of an IGUS is consistent with the four-dimensional laws of physics and
can be described in four-dimensional terms. The present, for instance, is not a
moment of time in the sense of a spacelike surface in spacetime. Rather there
is a localized notion of present at each point along an IGUS' world line. The
common present of many localized IGUSes is an approximate notion appropriate
when they are sufficiently close to each other and have relative velocities
much less than that of light. But modes of organization that are different from
present, past and future can be imagined that are consistent with the physical
laws. We speculate why the present, past, and future organization might be
favored by evolution and therefore a cognitive universal.

The characteristic time when a rotating black hole with the gravitational
radius $r_0$ reaches this final stationary state is $T\sim
r_0^{p-1}/(G\sigma)$, where $G$ is the higher dimensional gravitational
coupling constant, $\sigma$ is the brane tension, and $p$ is the number of
extra dimensions.

bottom quarks without fine tuning of the Yukawa coupling constants in the
context of the two Higgs doublet model (THDM). In the THDM with a discrete
symmetry, there exists the vacuum where only the top quark receives the mass of
the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale $v(\simeq 246 GeV)$, while
the bottom quark remains massless. By introducing a small soft-breaking
parameter $m_3^2$ of the discrete symmetry, the bottom quark perturbatively
acquires a nonzero mass. We show a model in which the small $m_3^2 [\sim
v^2/(4\pi)^2]$ is generated by the dynamics above the cutoff scale of the THDM.
The ratio $\tan\beta$ of the two vacuum expectation values is necessarily very
large; i.e., $\tan \beta \sim m_t/m_b$. We also find a salient relation,
$1/\tan\beta \simeq m_3^2/m_H^2$, where $m_H$ is the mass of the extra CP-even
Higgs boson. Our scenario yields some specific features that can be tested in
future collider experiments.

perceive three spatial dimensions. In this picture there may be at least two
species of dark matter particles, with scalar ``charges'' such that the scalar
interaction attracts particles with like sign and repels unlike signs. The net
charge vanishes. Under this condition the evolution of the mass distribution in
linear perturbation theory is the same as in the LambdaCDM cosmology, and both
models therefore can equally well pass the available cosmological tests. The
physics can be very different on small scales, however: if the scalar
interaction has the strength suggested by simple versions of the string
scenario, nonlinear mass concentrations are unstable against separation into
charged halos with properties unlike the standard model prediction and possibly
of observational interest.

a 0-bridge or 1-bridge braid in M; furthermore, we prove the minimal

the core of the surgery K_gamma yields S^3 by r-Dehn surgery, then we prove the

symplectic implosion to the category of quasi-Hamiltonian $K$-manifolds, where
$K$ is a simply connected compact Lie group. The imploded cross-section of the
double $K\times K$ turns out to be universal in a suitable sense. It is a
singular space, but some of its strata have a nonsingular closure. This
observation leads to interesting new examples of quasi-Hamiltonian
$K$-manifolds, such as the ``spinning $2n$-sphere'' for $K=\SU(n)$. Secondly we
construct a universal (``master'') moduli space of parabolic bundles with
structure group $K$ over a marked Riemann surface. The master moduli space
carries a natural action of a maximal torus of $K$ and a torus-invariant
stratification into manifolds, each of which has a symplectic structure. An
essential ingredient in the construction is the universal implosion.
Paradoxically, although the universal implosion has no complex structure (it is
the four-sphere for $K=\SU(2)$), the master moduli space turns out to be a
complex algebraic variety.
