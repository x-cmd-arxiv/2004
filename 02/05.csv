and atomic features in the thermal spectra of magnetic neutron stars. We show
that it is possible for vacuum polarization to strongly suppress the spectral
lines when the magnetic field B\ga 10^14 G. For weaker fields (B\la 7\times
10^13 G), the surface spectrum is unaffected by vacuum polarization; thus the
proton cyclotron absorption line can have a large equivalent width. Using an
approximate calculation of the synthetic spectra, we show that variation of
magnetic fields over the neutron star surface leads to broadening of the line.
The recently detected absorption features from the isolated neutron stars RX
J1308.6+2127, RX J1605.3+3249, and RX J0720.4-3125 can plausibly be explained
by the proton cyclotron resonance, with possible blending due to atomic
transitions, in the atmosphere of the star.

sub-stellar companions to young nearby stars on the northern sky. Our infrared
imaging observations are obtained with the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope and the

year, we found two co-moving companion candidates, one close to HD 77407 and
one close to GJ 577. For the companion candidate near GJ 577, we obtained an
optical spectrum showing spectral type M4.5; this candidate is a bound low-mass
stellar companion confirmed by both proper motion and spectroscopy. We estimate
the masses for HD 77407 B and GJ 577 B to be ~0.3 to 0.5 Msun and ~0.16 to 0.2

older than 100 Myrs. We also took multi-epoch high-resolution spectra of HD
77407 to search for sub-stellar companions, but did not find any with 3 Mjup as
upper mass (msin(i)) limit (for up to 4 year orbits); however, we detected a
long-term radial velocity trend in HD 77407 A, consistent with a ~ 0.3 Msun

structure, X-ray data from galaxy clusters, age estimates of globular clusters

remaining piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction
($\Omega_{\rm{T}} = 1$) with astronomical observations. Theoretically, they
have also stimulated the current interest for more general models containing an
extra component describing this unknown dark energy, and simultaneously
accounting for the present accelerating stage of the Universe. An overlook in
the literature shows that at least five dark energy candidates have been
proposed in the context of general relativistic models. Since the cosmological
constant and rolling scalar field models have already been extensively
discussed, in this short review we focus our attention to the three remaining
candidates, namely: a decaying vacuum energy density (or ${\bf \Lambda(t)}$

1995 and 2002 on a strip at dec=0 near the south Galactic cap. This sample
spans the range of radio flux densities from ~2 to 1000 mJy. It presents both
in size and radio flux density range a unique starting point for variability
studies of galaxies and quasars harboring lower luminosity Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN). We find, by comparing our variable and non-variable control
samples to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey the following: 1) The quasar fraction
of both the variable and non-variable samples declines as a function of
declining radio flux density levels; 2) our variable sample contains a
consistently higher fraction of quasars than the non-variable control sample,
irrespective of radio flux; 3) the variable sources are almost twice as likely
to be retrieved from the optical SDSS data than the non-variable ones; 4) based
on relative numbers, we estimate that quasars are about five times more likely
to harbor a variable radio source than are galaxies; and 5) there does not
appear to be any significant optical color offset between the two samples, even
though the suggestive trend for sources to be bluer when variable has been
detected before and may be real. This leads us to conclude that both radio
variability and radio flux density levels, in combination with accurate optical
information, are important discriminators in the study of (radio) variability
of galaxies. The latter start to dominate the source counts below about 20 mJy.
In any case, variability appears to be an intrinsic property of radio sources,
and is not limited to quasars. Radio variability at low flux density levels may
offer a unique tool in AGN unification studies.

difference of 10 mag in luminosity, it is imperative that simple luminosity

plasma embedded in a toroidal magnetic field, flowing radially outward from the
pulsar in a sector around the rotational equator. The relativistic cyclotron
instability of the ion gyrational orbit downstream of the leading shock in the
electron-positron pairs launches outward propagating magnetosonic waves.
Because of the fresh supply of ions crossing the shock, this time-dependent
process achieves a limit-cycle, in which the waves are launched with
periodicity on the order of the ion Larmor time. Compressions in the magnetic
field and pair density associated with these waves, as well as their
propagation speed, semi-quantitatively reproduce the behavior of the wisp and
ring features described in recent observations obtained using the Hubble Space
Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. By selecting the parameters of the
ion orbits to fit the spatial separation of the wisps, we predict the period of
time variability of the wisps that is consistent with the data. When coupled
with a mechanism for non-thermal acceleration of the pairs, the compressions in
the magnetic field and plasma density associated with the optical wisp
structure naturally account for the location of X-ray features in the Crab. We
also discuss the origin of the high energy ions and their acceleration in the

HST observations detect a very faint, extended object in I-band with no
emission from the lensed images visible; no detection at all is made in V-band.
The lens system is detected with much higher signal to noise with UKIRT in
K-band, but the resolution is not sufficient to allow the lensed images and the
lens galaxy to be separated. A careful astrometric calibration, however,
suggests that the peak of the infrared emission corresponds to the two merging
images A and B and therefore that the lensed images dominate at infrared
wavelengths. The new radio data consist of VLBI radio images at three
frequencies, 2.3, 5 and 8.4GHz, made with the VLBA and the 100-m Effelsberg
telescope. The lensed source consists of three well-defined sub-components
embedded in a more extended jet. Due to the fact that the sub-components have
different spectral indices it is possible to determine which part of each image
corresponds to the same source sub-component. Our main finding is that one of
the images, B, looks very different to the others, there being no obvious
division into separate sub-components and the image being apparently both
broader and smoother. This is a consequence we believe of scatter-broadening in
the ISM of the lensing galaxy. The large number of multiply-imaged source
sub-components also provide an abundance of modelling constraints and we have
attempted to fit an SIE+external shear model to the data, as well as utilising
the novel method of Evans & Witt. It proves difficult in both cases, however,
to obtain a satisfactory fit which strongly suggests the presence of
sub-structure in the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, perhaps of the
kind that is predicted by CDM theories of structure formation.

clusters. It is found that many aspects of partial localization are described
appropriately both by a variational wavefunction of Gutzwiller type and by a
treatment which keeps only those interactions which are present in LDA+U
calculations. In contrast, the energies and phase diagram calculated within the
Hartree Fock approximation show little resemblence with the exact results.
Enhancement of hopping anisotropy by Hund's rule correlations are found in all
approximations.

kinetics of precipitation and to build a mesoscopic model based on classical
nucleation theory so as to extend the field of supersaturations and annealing
times that can be simulated. We use some ab-initio calculations and
experimental data to fit an Ising model describing thermodynamics of the Al-Zr
and Al-Sc systems. Kinetic behavior is described by means of an atom-vacancy
exchange mechanism. This allows us to simulate with a kinetic Monte Carlo
algorithm kinetics of precipitation of Al3Zr and Al3Sc. These kinetics are then
used to test the classical nucleation theory. In this purpose, we deduce from
our atomic model an isotropic interface free energy which is consistent with
the one deduced from experimental kinetics and a nucleation free energy. We
test di erent mean-field approximations (Bragg-Williams approximation as well
as Cluster Variation Method) for these parameters. The classical nucleation
theory is coherent with the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations only when CVM is
used: it manages to reproduce the cluster size distribution in the metastable
solid solution and its evolution as well as the steady-state nucleation rate.
We also find that the capillary approximation used in the classical nucleation
theory works surprisingly well when compared to a direct calculation of the
free energy of formation for small L12 clusters.

parameters for pressure-less matter $\Omega_{\rm m}$, cosmological
constant/dark energy $\Omega_{\lambda}$, and radiation $\Omega_{\rm r}$ a new
density parameter $\Omega_\psi$ emerges. The field equations of the model
reduce to a system which is effectively given by the usual Friedmann equations
of general relativity, supplied by a correction to the energy density and
pressure in form of $\Omega_\psi$, which is related to the non-Riemannian
structure of the underlying spacetime. We search for the best-fit parameters by
using recent SN Ia data sets and constrain the possible contribution of a new
dark-energy like component at low redshifts, thereby we put an upper limit on
the presence of non-Riemannian quantities in the late stages of the universe.

studied. The numerical results of this work also apply to several anisotropic

Further we sketch a scenario where mixing of these operators with dimensions 3

is based on the stability of the solutions of SCG with respect to quantum
metric fluctuations. We pay special attention to the two-point quantum
correlation functions for the metric perturbations, which contain both
intrinsic and induced fluctuations. These fluctuations can be described by the
Einstein-Langevin equation obtained in the framework of stochastic gravity.
Specifically, the Einstein-Langevin equation yields stochastic correlation
functions for the metric perturbations which agree, to leading order in the
large $N$ limit, with the quantum correlation functions of the theory of
gravity interacting with $N$ matter fields. The homogeneous solutions of the
Einstein-Langevin equation are equivalent to the solutions of the perturbed
semiclassical equation, which describe the evolution of the expectation value
of the quantum metric perturbations. The information on the intrinsic
fluctuations, which are connected to the initial fluctuations of the metric
perturbations, can also be retrieved entirely from the homogeneous solutions.
However, the induced metric fluctuations proportional to the noise kernel can
only be obtained from the Einstein-Langevin equation (the inhomogeneous term).
These equations exhibit runaway solutions with exponential instabilities. A
detailed discussion about different methods to deal with these instabilities is
given. We illustrate our criterion by showing explicitly that flat space is
stable and a description based on SCG is a valid approximation in that case.

arbitrary potential V(\phi) in 5D general relativity is considered as a

such a configuration (i) has always an AdS asymptotic far from the brane, (ii)
is only possible if V(\phi) has an alternating sign and (iii) V(\phi) satisfies
a certain fine-tuning type equality. The thin brane limit is well defined and
conforms to the Randall-Sundrum (RS2) brane world model if the asymptotic value
of V(\phi) (related to \Lambda, the effective cosmological constant) is kept
thickness-independent. Universality of such a transition is demonstrated using
as an example exact solutions for stepwise potentials of different shapes.
Also, due to scale invariance of the Einstein-scalar equations, any given
regular solution creates a one-parameter family of solutions with different

\Lambda/(brane tension)^2 is thickness-independent and is in general different

solution requires no fine-tuning between boundary and bulk cosmological
constants, in contrast to the Randall-Sundrum model. Wall solutions are also
obtained with warp factors which are flat or increasing in one side by varying
a deformation parameter.

stable and accurate computation of turbulence using a large eddy simulation
[Ida and Taniguchi, Phys. Rev. E 68, 036705 (2003)]. In our previous paper, it
was shown, based on a simple assumption regarding the instantaneous streamwise
velocity, that the application of the Gaussian filter to the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations can result in the appearance of a numerically unstable
term that can be decomposed into positive and negative viscosities. That result
raises the question as to whether an accurate solution can be achieved by a
numerically stable subgrid-scale model. In the present paper, based on
assumptions regarding the statistically averaged velocity, we present similar
theoretical investigations to show that in several situations, the shears
appearing in the statistically averaged velocity field numerically destabilize
the fluctuation components because of the derivation of a numerically unstable
term that represents negative diffusion in a fixed direction. This finding can
explain the problematic numerical instability that has been encountered in
large eddy simulations of wall-bounded flows. The present result suggests that
this numerical problem is universal in large eddy simulations, and that if
there is no failure in modeling, the resulting subgrid-scale model can still
have unstable characteristics; that is, the known instability problems of
several existing subgrid-scale models are not something that one may remove
simply by an artificial technique, but must be taken seriously so as to treat
them accurately.

develop a model of the competition between wild type (wt) and a mutant under a

coinfecting with wt, because it can profit from superior protein products

games are analyzed both for classical and quantum settings. The corruption rate
dependent changes in the payoffs and strategies of the players are observed. It
is shown that there is a critical corruption rate at which the players lose
their quantum advantage, and that the classical strategies are more robust to
the corruption in the source. Moreover, it is understood that the information
on the corruption rate of the source may help the players choose their optimal
strategy for resolving the dilemma and increase their payoffs. The study is
carried out in two different corruption scenarios for Prisoner's Dilemma,
Samaritan's Dilemma, and Battle of Sexes.

a pair of EPR (Einstein-Podolski-Rosen) beams is generated from two independent

squeezed beams that contain the signal were recovered. Although our squeezing
level is not sufficient to demonstrate the channel capacity gain over the
Holevo limit of a single-mode channel without entanglement, our channel is
superior to conventional channels such as coherent and squeezing channels. In
addition, optical addition and subtraction processes demonstrated are
elementary operations of universal quantum information processing on continuous

  Info. for the NQSI workshop in Kyoto","Int. J. Quantum Inf. 2,101 (2004)",,,"quant-ph",,"  When the electromagnetic field is detected by stimulated emission, rather
than by absorption, antinormally ordered photodetection can be realized. One of
the distinct features of this photodetection scheme is its sensitivity to
zero-point fluctuation due to the existence of the spontaneous emission. We
have recently succeeded in experimentally demonstrating the antinormally
ordered photodetection by exploiting nondegenerate stimulated parametric
down-conversion process. To properly account for the experiment, the detection
process needs to be treated with time-dependent and continuous-mode operators
because of the broadband nature of the parametric down-conversion process and
the wide spectrum of the pump that we used. Here, we theoretically analyze the
antinormally ordered intensity correlation of the continuous-mode fields by
pursuing the detection process in the Heisenberg picture. It is shown that the
excess positive correlation due to zero-point fluctuation reduces because of
the frequency-distinguishability of the two emitted photon pairs.

theory (if so), I try to define for general physical theories what we mean by
`holism'. For this purpose I propose an epistemological criterion to decide
whether or not a physical theory is holistic, namely: a physical theory is
holistic if and only if it is impossible in principle to infer the global
properties, as assigned in the theory, by local resources available to an
agent. I propose that these resources include at least all local operations and
classical communication. This approach is contrasted with the well-known
approaches to holism in terms of supervenience. The criterion for holism
proposed here involves a shift in emphasis from ontology to epistemology. I
apply this epistemological criterion to classical physics and Bohmian mechanics
as represented on a phase and configuration space respectively, and for quantum
mechanics (in the orthodox interpretation) using the formalism of general
quantum operations as completely positive trace non-increasing maps.
Furthermore, I provide an interesting example from which one can conclude that
quantum mechanics is holistic in the above mentioned sense, although, perhaps
surprisingly, no entanglement is needed.
