available to the public. PMFAST is based on a two-level mesh gravity solver
where the gravitational forces are separated into long and short range
components. The decomposition scheme minimizes communication costs and allows
tolerance for slow networks. The code approaches optimality in several
dimensions. The force computations are local and exploit highly optimized
vendor FFT libraries. It features minimal memory overhead, with the particle
positions and velocities being the main cost. The code features support for
distributed and shared memory parallelization through the use of MPI and
OpenMP, respectively.
  The current release version uses two grid levels on a slab decomposition,
with periodic boundary conditions for cosmological applications. Open boundary
conditions could be added with little computational overhead. We present timing
information and results from a recent cosmological production run of the code
using a 3712^3 mesh with 6.4 x 10^9 particles. PMFAST is cost-effective,
memory-efficient, and is publicly available.

the technique of using disk space as virtual memory and transferring data in

mesh while long-range physics is captured on a lower resolution, global mesh.
The two-level mesh gravity solver allows FFTs to operate on data stored
entirely in memory, which is much faster than the alternative of computing the
transforms out-of-core through non-sequential disk accesses. We also describe
an out-of-core initial conditions generator that is used to prepare large data
sets for cosmological simulations. The out-of-core code is accurate,
cost-effective, and memory-efficient and the current version is implemented to
run in parallel on shared-memory machines. I/O overhead is significantly
reduced down to less than 10% by performing disk operations concurrently with
numerical calculations. The current computational setup, which includes a 32

drift of charged particles across the slot gap field lines at very high
altitudes. These boundary conditions and the deviation of particle trajectories
from stream lines determine the asymptotic behavior of the scalar potential at
all radii from the polar cap to near the light cylinder. As a result, we
demonstrate that the steady-state accelerating electric field must approach a
small and constant value at high altitude above the polar cap. This parallel
electric field is capable of maintaining electrons moving with high Lorentz
factors (a few times 10^7) and emitting curvature gamma-ray photons up to
nearly the light cylinder. By numerical simulations, we show that primary
electrons accelerating from the polar cap surface to high altitude in the slot
gap along the outer edge of the open field region will form caustic emission
patterns on the trailing dipole field lines. Acceleration and emission in such
an extended slot gap may form the physical basis of a model that can

still remaining compatible with their estimates. We find that $\Omega_{\rm

fluctuations, we find that the inclusion of VSA data leads to a negative
running at a level of more than 95% confidence ($n_{\rm run}=-0.069\pm 0.032$),
something which is not significantly changed by the inclusion of a stringent
prior on the Hubble constant. Inclusion of prior information from the 2dF
galaxy redshift survey reduces the significance of the result by constraining
the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We discuss the veracity of this result in the
context of various systematic effects and also a broken spectral index model.
We also constrain the fraction of neutrinos and find that $f_{\nu}< 0.087$ at
95% confidence which corresponds to $m_\nu<0.32{\rm eV}$ when all neutrino
masses are the equal. Finally, we consider the global best fit within a general
cosmological model with 12 parameters and find consistency with other analyses
available in the literature. The evidence for $n_{\rm run}<0$ is only marginal

supermassive black holes, and the best diagnostic of their presence in
non-active galaxies, would be occasional tidal disruption of stars captured by
the black holes. These events manifest themselves in form of luminous flares
powered by accretion of debris from the disrupted star into the black hole.
  Candidate events among optically non-active galaxies emerged in the past few
years. For the first time, we have looked with high spatial and spectral
resolution at one of these most extreme variability events ever recorded among
galaxies. Here, we report measuring a factor ~200 drop in luminosity of the
X-ray source RXJ 1242-1119 with the X-ray observatories Chandra and XMM-Newton,
and perform key tests of the favored outburst scenario, tidal disruption of a
star by a supermassive black hole. We show that the detected `low-state'
emission has properties such that it must still be related to the flare. The
power-law shaped post-flare X-ray spectrum indicates a `hardening' compared to
outburst. The inferred black hole mass, the amount of liberated energy, and the
duration of the event favor an accretion event of the form expected from the
(partial or complete) tidal disruption of a star (abstract abbreviated).

  efficient and radiatively inefficient cases","submitted to MNRAS. 15 pages, 6 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We study the accretion flow of a hot gas captured by the black hole gravity
in the presence of a thin cold accretion disk. Such geometrical arrangement is
expected in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and in galactic X-ray binary systems
because both hot and cold gases are present in the black hole vicinity.
Previous astrophysical literature concentrated on the evaporation of the cold
disk in the classical heat conduction limit. Here we consider the inverse
process, i.e. condensation of the hot gas onto the cold disk. We find two
distinct condensation regimes. (i) In the classical thermal conduction limit,
the radiative cooling in the hot gas itself force condensation above a certain
critical accretion rate. Most of the flow energy in this case is re-emitted as
X-ray radiation. (ii) Below a certain minimum accretion rate, the hot electrons
are collisionless and the classical heat flux description becomes invalid. We
use the ``non-local'' heat flux approach borrowed from the terrestrial laser
heated plasma experiments. Due to their very large mean free path, the hot
particles penetrate deep into the cold disk where the radiative losses are
significant enough to enable condensation. In this case the hot flow energy is
inconspicuously re-radiated by the transition layer in many UV and especially
optical recombination lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, $H\alpha$, H$\beta$) as well as
via the optically thick disk emission. We derive an approximate analytical
solution for the dynamics of the hot condensing flow. If the cold disk is
inactive, i.e. accumulating mass for a future accretion outburst, then the
two-phase flows appear radiatively inefficient. These condensing solutions may
be relevant to \sgra, low luminosity AGN, and transient binary accreting
systems in quiescence.

from the photospheres of the secondary stars in every system, even though two
of the m were undergoing outubrsts. We have attempted to assign spectral types
to each of the secondary stars, and these classifications are generally
consistent with previous determinations/estimates. We find evidence for
abundance anomalies that include enhancements and/or deficits for all of the
species commonly found in the K-band spectra of G- and K-type dwarfs. There is,
however, only one common abundance anomaly: extremely weak CO features. Only
two of the twelve objects appeared to have normal levels of CO absorption. We
interpret this as evidence for low carbon abundances. In addition, we detect
13CO absorption in four of the twelve objects. Depleted levels of 12C and
enhanced levels of 13C indicate that material that has been processed in the
CNO cycle is finding its way into the photospheres of CV secondary stars. In
systems with luminous accretion disks, we find that the spectrum of the
secondary star is contaminated by a source that flattens (reddens) the
continuum. While free-free or classical accretion disk spectra are flatter than
the blackbody-like spectra of G and K dwarfs, removal of such contamination
from the K-band data results in spectra in which the absorption features become
too strong to be consistent with those of G and K dwarfs.

Eddington ratios, L/Ledd, from the bolometric luminosities and emission line
widths for each object in the sample. The sample spans 5 orders of magnitude in
supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, 7 orders of magnitude in luminosity, and a
redshift range from 0 <= z <= 5. We include a sample of 26 low-redshift
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) for comparative analysis. The NLS1s have
slightly larger than average L/Ledd ratios (and smaller SMBH masses) for their
luminosities, but those L/Ledd values are still substantially below the average
for luminous quasars. A large fraction (27%) of the objects overall have L/Ledd
> 1, which might be explained by non-spherically symmetric accretion. We find
no trend between L/Ledd and either redshift or SMBH mass. Composite spectra
sorted by L/Ledd show an unusual emission-line behavior: nearly constant peak
heights and decreasing FWHMs with increasing L/Ledd. This is in marked contrast
to the emission-line behaviors with luminosity, SMBH mass, and FWHM(C IV),
which clearly show trends analogous to the Baldwin Effect: decreasing line
peaks and equivalent widths with increasing luminosity, SMBH mass, and FWHM.
The origins of the unusual behavior with L/Ledd are not understood, but one
implication is that metallicity estimates based on emission line ratios
involving nitrogen show no trend with L/Ledd in the composite spectra created
from different ranges in L/Ledd. The NLS1 composite, however, shows a slightly
high metallicity for its SMBH mass and luminosity. Our earlier work suggests
that host galaxy mass, correlated with SMBH mass and AGN luminosity, is the
fundamental parameter affecting BLR metallicities. Some secondary effect, not
related to L/Ledd, must be enhancing the metallicities in NLS1s.

structure of their dusty ISM. Dust lanes are a generic feature of massive disks
with V_rot>120km/s, but are completely absent in galaxies with V_rot<120km/s.
The transition reflects an increase in the scale height of the cold ISM in low
mass galaxies, driven by larger turbulent velocities supporting the gas layer,
rather than sharp drops in the gas surface density. We identify the
V_rot=120km/s transition with the onset of gravitational instabilities in high
mass galaxies. The instabilities lead to fragmentation and gravitational
collapse along spiral arms, smaller gas scale heights, lower turbulent
velocities, and thus to narrow dust lanes. The drop in velocity dispersion may
be due either to a switch in the driving mechanism for turbulence or to a
change in the response of the ISM to supernovae after the ISM has collapsed to
a dense layer. The resulting smaller gas scale height can lead to significant
increases in the star formation rate when disk instabilities are present, and
may explain the Kennicutt surface density threshold for star formation. Our
data suggest that star formation will be systematically less efficient in low
mass disks with V_c<120km/s, leading to star formation timescales longer than
the gas accretion timescale. This effect can suppress the metallicity and
nucleosynthetic yields of low mass disks, and thus explain the disk
mass-metallicity relationship without invoking galactic SN-driven outflows. The
transitions in disk stability, dust structure, and/or star formation efficiency
may also be responsible for observed changes in the slope of the Tully-Fisher
relation, in the sharp increase in the thickness of dwarf galaxy disks, and in
the onset of bulges in galaxies with V_rot>120km/s. (Abridged)

and slow expansion velocity are similar to those of super-outbursts of luminous

obtained Hubble Space Telescope STIS images and spectra of the stars in the

the closest to the optical and radio positions of SN 1961V. Object 7 is the
only point source detected in our STIS spectra and only its H-alpha emission is
detected; it cannot be the SN or its remnant because of the absence of
forbidden lines. While the H-alpha line profile of Object 7 is remarkably
similar to that of eta Car, the blue color (similar to an A2Ib supergiant) and
lack of appreciable variability are unlike known post-outburst LBVs. We have
also obtained Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of SN 1961V at 18
cm. The non-detection of SN 1961V places a lower limit on the size of the
radio-emitting region, 7.6 mas or 0.34 pc, which implies an average expansion
velocity in excess of 4,400 km/s, much higher than the optical expansion
velocity measured in 1961. We conclude the following: (1) A SN occurred in the
vicinity of SN 1961V a few decades ago. (2) If the SN 1961V light maximum
originates from a giant eruption of a massive star, Object 7 is the most
probable candidate for the survivor, but its blue color and lack of significant
variability are different from a post-outburst eta Car. (3) The radio SN and
Object 7 could be physically associated with each other through a binary
system. (4) Object 7 needs to be monitored to determine its nature and
relationship to SN 1961V.

and flux-calibrated spectra have been obtained. BC_K is a well-behaved function

significantly more scattered for types T5-T9. T_eff declines steeply and
monotonically for types M6-L7 and T4-T9, but is nearly constant at ~1450 K for
types L7-T4 with assumed ages of ~3 Gyr. This constant T_eff is evidenced by
nearly unchanging values of L'-M' between types L6 and T3. We compare the
observed K, L', and M' luminosities of L and T dwarfs in our sample with those
predicted by model atmospheres with varying surface gravities and sedimentation
efficiencies. The models indicate that the L3-T4.5 dwarfs generally have higher

reveal differences in chemical composition at various positions. In particular,
young condensations just outside the dusty Homunculus Nebula show strong
nitrogen lines and little or no oxygen -- but farther away, nitrogen lines
weaken and oxygen lines become stronger. The observed variations in the
apparent N/O ratio may signify either that the various blobs were ejected with
different abundances, or more likely, that the more distant condensations are
interacting with normal-composition material. The second hypothesis is
supported by various other clues involving kinematics and X-ray emission, and
would suggest that Eta Car is enveloped in a ``cocoon'' deposited by previous
stellar-wind mass loss. In particular, all emission features where we detect
strong oxygen lines are coincident with or outside the soft X-ray shell. In
either case, the observed abundance variations suggest that Eta Car's ejection
of nitrogen-rich material is a recent phenomenon -- taking place in just the
last few thousand years. Thus, Eta Carinae may be at a critical stage of
evolution when ashes of the CNO cycle have just appeared at its surface.
Finally, these spectra reveal some extremely fast nitrogen-rich material, with
Doppler velocities up to 3200 km/s, and actual space velocities that may be
much higher. This is the fastest material yet seen in Eta Car's nebula, but
with unknown projection angles its age is uncertain.

spectrum using a Fokker-Planck code. As a simplest multi-mass model, we first
investigated the two-component clusters. Rotation is found to accelerate the
dynamical evolution through the transfer of angular momentum outward, as well
as from the high masses to the low masses. However, the degree of acceleration
depends sensitively on the assumed initial mass function since dynamical
friction, which generates mass segregation, also tends to accelerate the
evolution, and the combined effect of both is not linear or multiplicative. As
long as dynamical friction dominates in the competition with angular momentum
exchange the heavy masses lose random energy and angular momentum, sink towards
the centre, but their remaining angular momentum is sufficient to speed them up
rotationally. This is gravo-gyro instability. As a consequence, we find that
the high mass stars in the central parts rotate faster than low mass stars.
This leads to the suppression of mass segregation compared to the non-rotating
clusters. From the study of multi-component models, we observe similar trends
to the two-component models in almost all aspects. The mass function changes
less drastically for clusters with rotation. Unlike non-rotating clusters, the
mass function depends on $R$ and $z$. Our models are the only ones that can
predict mass function and other quantities to be compared with new
observations.

a two temperature thermal plasma model with kT_1\sim0.2 keV and kT_2sim1.4 keV.
In addition, we find that the star does not display any significant short-term
changes during the XMM-Newton exposure. Compared to previous Einstein and ROSAT
detections, it also appears that HD108 does not present long-term flux
variations either. While the dramatic line variations continue to modify

Although its location on the sky coincides with a nearby extended photoionized
region recently identified by Cichowolski et al. (2003) in radio data from the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS), the systemic velocity of this ~ 1
arcmin-sized HII region, V_LSR = -71$\pm$12 km/s, poses it far out in the

supported by HI structures visible at comparable radial velocity on CGPS data.

emission line ratios of the surrounding extended nebula, whose radial velocity
is consistent with that of the small HII region, are typical of photoionized
gas in the low density limit. Smaller clumps of comparable surface brightness
are visible within the optical boundaries of the extended, faint nebula. After
comparison of the optical data with far infrared and radio observations, we
conclude that this nebula is an HII region, ~ 70 pc in size, probably

long enough annealing time. The aim of this study is to model the kinetics of
precipitation during this nucleation stage. We use FP-LMTO (Full-Potential
Linear-Mu n-Tin-Orbitals) calculations to fit a generalized Ising model
describing thermodynamics of the Al-Zr system. As we are interested in the
nucleation stage, the structures considered to obtain the interactions of the
Ising model are lying on a perfect fcc lattice having the lattice parameter of
Al. This allows us to stabilize the L12 structure with respect to the DO23. In
order to be able to take into account the influence of local environment on
kinetics, interactions for the tetrahedron of first nearest-neighbors are
considered, and for the pair of second nearest neighbours so as to stabilize
the L12 structure. We then generalize our description of the configurational
energy of the binary Al-Zr to the one of the ternary Al-Zr-Vacancy system by
including interactions with vacancies. Saddle point energies for the migration
of the vacancy are fitted using experimental di usion coe cients. This model is
then employed in a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation which considers the di usion
through the jumps of a vacancy. Thus we are able to study the Al3Zr kinetics of
nucleation.

This is
because the superconformal anomaly dictates that supersymmetry breaking is
transmitted through nearly flavor-blind infrared physics that is highly
predictive and UV insensitive. Slepton mass squareds, however, are predicted to
be negative. This can be solved by adding D-terms for U(1)_Y and U(1)_{B-L}
while retaining the UV insensitivity. In this paper we consider electroweak
symmetry breaking via UV insensitive anomaly mediation in several models. For
the MSSM we find a stable vacuum when tanbeta < 1, but in this region the top
Yukawa coupling blows up only slightly above the supersymmetry breaking scale.
For the NMSSM, we find a stable electroweak breaking vacuum but with a chargino
that is too light. Replacing the cubic singlet term in the NMSSM superpotential
with a term linear in the singlet we find a stable vacuum and viable spectrum.
Most of the parameter region with correct vacua requires a large superpotential
coupling, precisely what is expected in the ``Fat Higgs'' model in which the
superpotential is generated dynamically. We have therefore found the first
viable UV complete, UV insensitive supersymmetry breaking model that solves the
flavor and CP problems automatically: the Fat Higgs model with UV insensitive
anomaly mediation. Moreover, the cosmological gravitino problem is naturally
solved, opening up the possibility of realistic thermal leptogenesis.

by a a Lie algebra of vector fields on a compactification. We extend to Lie
manifolds several classical results on Sobolev spaces, elliptic regularity, and
mapping properties of pseudodifferential operators. A tubular neighborhood
theorem for Lie submanifolds allows us also to extend to regular open subsets
of Lie manifolds the classical results on traces of functions in suitable
Sobolev spaces. Our main application is a regularity result on polyhedral
domains $\PP \subset \RR^3$ using the weighted Sobolev spaces $\Kond{m}a(\PP)$.
In particular, we show that there is no loss of $\Kond{m}a$--regularity for
solutions of strongly elliptic systems with smooth coefficients. For the proof,
we identify $\Kond{m}a(\PP)$ with the Sobolev spaces on $\PP$ associated to the
metric $r_{\PP}^{-2} g_E$, where $g_E$ is the Euclidean metric and $r_{\PP}(x)$
is a smoothing of the Euclidean distance from $x$ to the set of singular points
of $\PP$. A suitable compactification of the interior of $\PP$ then becomes a
regular open subset of a Lie manifold. We also obtain the well-posedness of a
non-standard boundary value problem on a smooth, bounded domain with boundary
$\maO \subset \RR^n$ using weighted Sobolev spaces, where the weight is the
distance to the boundary.

$p$ with this prescribed tangent vector. This existence result goes back to
Nijenhuis-Woolf. All the $J$ holomorphic curves are of class $\CC^{1,\alpha}$
in this case.
  Then, exactly as for complex manifolds one can define the Royden-Kobayashi
pseudo-norm of tangent vectors. The question arises whether this pseudo-norm is
an upper semi-continuous function on the tangent bundle. For complex manifolds
it is the crucial point in Royden's proof of the equivalence of the two
standard definitions of the Kobayashi pseudo-metric. The upper semi-continuity

structures that are smooth enough. In [I-R], it is shown that $\CC^{1,\alpha}$

using the methods of Bayesian inference. The starting point is the maximum
entropy estimate for the posterior distribution of radiance in multiple bands.
In order to convert this quantity to an estimator for surface temperature and
emissivity with Bayes' theorem, it is necessary to obtain the joint prior
probability for surface temperature and emissivity, given available prior
knowledge. The requirement that any pair of distinct observers be able to
relate their descriptions of radiance under arbitrary Lorentz transformations
uniquely determines the prior probability. Perhaps surprisingly, surface
temperature acts as a scale parameter, while emissivity acts as a location
parameter, giving the prior probability P(T,emissivity|K)=const./T dT
d(emissivity). Given this result, it is a simple matter to construct estimators
for surface temperature and emssivity. Monte Carlo simulations of land surface
temeprature retrieval in selected MODIS bands are presented as examples of the
utility of the approach.

coupling effects in a high-finesse optical cavity, and the experimental
realization of such a device. Radiation pressure exerted by light limits the
sensitivity of high precision optical measurements. In particular, the
sensitivity of interferometric measurements of gravitational wave is limited by
the so called standard quantum limit. cavity with a movable mirror. The
internal field stored in such cavity can be orders of magnitude greater than
the input field, and it's radiation pressure force can change the physical
length of the cavity. In turn, any change in the mirror's position changes the
phase of the out put field. This optomechanical coupling leads to an
intensity-dependent phase shift for the light equivalent to an optical Kerr
effect. Such a device can then be used for squeezing generation or quantum
nondemolition measurements. In our experiment, we send a laser beam in to a
high-finesse optical cavity with a movable mirror coated on a high Q-factor
mechanical resonator. Quantum effects of radiation pressure become therefore,
at low temperature, experimentally observable. However, we've shown that the
phase of the reflected field is very sensitive to small mirror displacements,
which indicate other possible applications of this type of device like high
precision displacements measurements. We've been able to observe the Brownian
motion of the moving mirror. We've also used an auxiliary intensity modulated
laser beam to optically excite the acoustic modes. We've finally obtained a
sensitivity of 2x10^(-19) m/sqrt(Hz), in agreement with theoretical prediction.

the quantum coherence over so many degrees of freedom as to render it
unobservable. Decoherence theory has been complemented by experiments using
matter waves coupled to external photons or molecules, and by investigations
using coherent photon states, trapped ions and electron interferometers. Large
molecules are particularly suitable for the investigation of the
quantum-classical transition because they can store much energy in numerous
internal degrees of freedom; the internal energy can be converted into thermal
radiation and thus induce decoherence. Here we report matter wave
interferometer experiments in which C70 molecules lose their quantum behaviour

  different from the published one","Eur. Phys. J. D 31, 507 (2004)","10.1140/epjd/e2004-00137-8",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the quantum dynamics of N coherently driven two-level atoms coupled
to an optical resonator. In the strong coupling regime the cavity field
generated by atomic scattering interferes destructively with the pump on the
atoms. This suppresses atomic excitation and even for strong driving fields
prevents atomic saturation, while the stationary intracavity field amplitude is
almost independent of the atom number. The magnitude of the interference effect
depends on the detuning between laser and cavity field and on the relative
atomic positions and is strongest for a wavelength spaced lattice of atoms
placed at the antinodes of the cavity mode. In this case three dimensional
intensity minima are created in the vicinity of each atom. In this regime
spontaneous emission is suppressed and the dominant loss channel is cavity
decay. Even for a cavity linewidth larger than the atomic natural width, one
regains strong interference through the cooperative action of a sufficiently
large number of atoms. These results give a new key to understand recent
experiments on collective cavity cooling and may allow to implement fast
tailored atom-atom interactions as well as nonperturbative particle detection
with very small energy transfer.

complementary contexts set by incompatible measurements. We argue that an
arbitrary preparation, therefore, should be described with respect to such a
context by its degrees of disturbance (represented by real numbers) and their
probability distribution (postulate 1). Measurement contexts thus provide
reference frames for the preparation space of a physical system; a preparation
being described by a point in this space with the aforementioned as its
coordinates relative to a given measurement apparatus. However, all measurement
contexts are equivalent with regard to the description of a given preparation;
there is no preferred measurement (postulate 2). In the framework provided by
the preparation space, we show that quantum mechanics emerges naturally from
the above postulates in a new formulation which is manifestly canonical;
provided the degrees of disturbance are identified with the quantum phases of
the preparation with respect to (the basis furnished by) the measurement
apparatus.

particles with spin 1/2 moving in external fields. It is shown that the
analogue of Zitterbewegung for general observables can be removed to arbitrary
order in \hbar by projecting to dynamically almost invariant subspaces of the
quantum mechanical Hilbert space which are associated with particles and
anti-particles. This not only allows to identify observables with a
semiclassical meaning, but also to recover combined classical dynamics for the
translational and spin degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss properties of
eigenspinors of a Dirac-Hamiltonian when these are projected to the almost
invariant subspaces, including the phenomenon of quantum ergodicity.

inhomogeneously broadened three-level atoms subjected to the action of two
counterpropagating fields of the same frequency. By concentrating in the limit
of large detuning in one-photon transitions, we solve perturbatively the Bloch
equations in a non-usual way. In this way we derive an analytical expression
for the width of the two-photon resonance that makes evident sub-Doppler
two--photon spectroscopy. We also derive an analytical expression for the Stark
shift of the two-photon resonance.
