function
  (LF) which occurs when analysing faint galaxy samples. This effect exists
because of the different spectral energy distributions of galaxies, which are
in turn quantified by the k-corrections. We demonstrate that this bias occurs
because not all galaxy types are visible in the same absolute magnitude range
at a given redshift and it mainly arises at high redshift since it is related
to large k-corrections. We use realistic simulations with observed LFs to
investigate the amplitude of the bias. We also compare our results to the
global LFs derived from Hubble Deep Field-North and -South (HDF) surveys. We
conclude that, as expected, there is no bias in the global LF measured in the
absolute magnitude range where all galaxy types are observable. Beyond this
range the faint-end slope of the global LF can be over/under-estimated
depending on the adopted LF estimator. The effect is larger when the reference
filter in which the global LF is measured, is far from the rest-frame filter in
which galaxies are selected. The fact that LF estimators are differently
affected by this bias implies that the bias is minimal when the different LF
estimators give measurements consistent with one another at the faint-end. For
instance, we show that the estimators are discrepant in the same way both in
the simulated and HDF LFs. This suggests that the HDF LFs are affected by the
presently studied bias. The best solution to avoid this bias is to derive the
global LF in the reference filter closest to the rest-frame selection filter.

constrained more tightly than $w_X(z)$ given the same observational data. We
demonstrate this explicitly using current type Ia supernova (SN Ia) data [the
Tonry/Barris sample], together with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift
parameter from CMB data (WMAP, CBI, and ACBAR), and the large scale structure
(LSS) growth factor from 2dF galaxy survey data. We assume a flat universe, and
use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique in our analysis. We find that,
while $w_X(z)$ extracted from current data is consistent with a cosmological

halo concentration model of Bullock et al. (2001) accurately predicts the
median concentrations of haloes over the range of w, halo masses, and redshifts
that we are capable of probing. We find that the Bullock et al. (2001) model
works best when halo masses and concentrations are defined relative to an outer
radius set by a cosmology-dependent virial overdensity. For a fixed power
spectrum normalization and fixed-mass haloes, larger values of w lead to higher
concentrations and higher halo central densities, both because collapse occurs
earlier and because haloes have higher virial densities. While precise
predictions of halo densities are quite sensitive to various uncertainties, we
make broad comparisons to galaxy rotation curve data. At fixed power spectrum
normalization (fixed sigma_8), w>-1 quintessence models seem to exacerbate the
central density problem relative to the standard w=-1 model. Meanwhile w<-1
models help to reduce the apparent discrepancy. We confirm that the Jenkins et
al. (2001) halo mass function provides an excellent approximation to the
abundance of haloes in our simulations and extend its region of validity to
include models with w<-1.

find that long enrichment times (larger than 5 Gyr) are necessary to produce
the central abundance peaks. Classical cooling flows, a strongly convective
intracluster medium, and a complete metal mixing by cluster mergers would
destroy the observed abundance peaks too rapidly. Thus the observations set
strong constraints on cluster evolution models requiring that the cooling cores
in clusters are preserved over very long times. We further conclude from the
observations that the innermost part of the intracluster medium is most
probably dominated by gas originating predominantly from stellar mass loss of
the cD galaxy.

HI emission, indicating that the molecular gas forms from the atomic hydrogen

heavily obscured disk-like structure and several knots in the central region.
Galactic material, some of it in the form of two tails, is detected well beyond
the main body of the galaxy. The second, fainter tail and several knots are
reported here for the first time. The narrow band images show that the galaxy
is a powerful emitter. The emission in the main lines extends all over the
galaxy, with plumes and arc-like structures seen in H$\alpha$ at large
distances from the center. The uncorrected H$\alpha$ flux corresponds to
3.51$\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 3 times that of Arp 220. The internal
extinction deduced from the Balmer decrement is high all along the slit, with
E$_{B-V}\approx$ 1. There are no clear signs of nuclear activity and the
observed line ratios can be explained in terms of stellar photoionization. The
metallicity of the gas in the two brightest central knots is low, 0.1
Z$_{\odot}$ and 0.06 Z$_{\odot}$ respectively. In the main body of the galaxy,
besides the reported knots, the distribution of the ionized gas resembles that
of an inclined disk about 12 kpc in size. The rotation pattern is complex and
corresponds to two identifiable disk galaxies with observed rotation amplitudes
of 200 \kms and 100 \kms respectively. The data presented here indicate that IC
1182 is a high luminosity starburst system, involving two systems in the
process of merging, with two tidal tails emerging from the central region of
the galaxy.

  The host galaxies of AGN identified in this work cover a wide range of
optical properties with every galaxy type being represented, and no obvious
preference for one type over another. Redder types tend to be more luminous
than blue types, particularly at lower redshifts. The host galaxies also span a
wide range of optical luminosity, in contrast to the narrow range found for the
starburst galaxies detected in micro Jy radio surveys. We find a strong
correlation between optical and X-ray luminosity similar to the Magorrian
relation, although selection effects cannot be ruled out.

and inner disk but also uncover the presence of a cold counter-rotating stellar

NGC7332 is young everywhere. The presence of a large-scale bar can explain most
of those properties, but the fact that we see a significant amount of unsettled

played an important role in the formation and evolution of NGC7332, and

$\Map$ and of the smoothed shear component $\gammais$. We also propose new
unbiased estimators for low-order cumulants which have less scatter than the
usual estimators of non-Gaussianity based on the moments themselves. Then,
using an analytical model which has already been seen to provide a good
description of weak gravitational lensing through comparison against numerical
simulations, we study the statistical measures which can be extracted from
future surveys like the SNAP experiment. We recover the fact that at small
angular scales ($1'<\theta_s<10'$) the variance can be extracted with a few
percent level accuracy. Non-Gaussianity can also be measured from the skewness
of the aperture-mass (at a 10% level) while the shear kurtosis is more noisy
and cannot be easily measured beyond 6'. On the other hand, we find that the
pdf of the estimator associated with the aperture-mass can be distinguished
both from the Gaussian and the Edgeworth expansion and could provide useful
constraints, while this appears to be difficult to realize with the shear
component. Finally, we investigate various survey strategies and the
possibility to perform a redshift binning of the sample.

Crystallization at $r_s=42$. This leads to the insensitivity of $g^*$ to the
spin polarization and to the density. The compressibility and the
spin-susceptibility enhancement calculated from the free energy confirm the
validity of a simple approach to the two-valley response based on coupled-mode
formation. The three methods, QMC, CHNC, and Coupled-mode theory agree closely.
Our results contain no {\it ad hoc} fit parameters. They agree with experiments
and do not invoke impurity effects or metal-insulator transition phenomenology.

hardest combinatorial optimization problems and is closely related to a 3-state
anti-ferromagnetic Potts model. Like many other such optimization problems, it
has been shown to exhibit a phase transition in its ground state behavior under
variation of a system parameter: the graph's mean vertex degree. This phase
transition is often associated with the instances of highest complexity. We use
extremal optimization to measure the ground state cost and the ``backbone'', an
order parameter related to ground state overlap, averaged over a large number
of instances near the transition for random graphs of size $n$ up to 512. For
graphs up to this size, benchmarks show that extremal optimization reaches
ground states and explores a sufficient number of them to give the correct
backbone value after about $O(n^{3.5})$ update steps. Finite size scaling gives
a critical mean degree value $\alpha_{\rm c}=4.703(28)$. Furthermore, the
exploration of the degenerate ground states indicates that the backbone order
parameter, measuring the constrainedness of the problem, exhibits a first-order
phase transition.

observation of cosmic rays originating from cosmological distances with

consider strongly interacting neutrino scenarios as an especially interesting
solution. We show that all features of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum
from 10^{17} eV to 10^{21} eV can be described to originate from a simple
power-like injection spectrum of protons, under the assumption that the
neutrino-nucleon cross-section is significantly enhanced at center of mass
energies above ~ 100 TeV. In such a scenario, the cosmogenic neutrinos produced
during the propagation of protons through the cosmic microwave background
initiate air showers in the atmosphere, just as the protons. The total air
shower spectrum induced by protons and neutrinos shows excellent agreement with
the observations. We shortly discuss TeV-scale extensions of the Standard Model
which may lead to a realization of a strongly interacting neutrino scenario. We
emphasize, however, that such a scenario may even be realized within the
standard electroweak model: electroweak instanton/sphaleron induced processes
may get strong at ultrahigh energies. Possible tests of strongly interacting
neutrino scenarios range from observations at cosmic ray facilities and
neutrino telescopes to searches at lepton nucleon scattering experiments.

been obtained by PIBETA Collaboration. Namely, SM fails to describe the energy

  The previous experiment at ISTRA facility, testing the radiative decays of
negative pions in flight in a wide kinematic region has alarmed about the same

indicates a deficit of the branching ratio of the radiative pion decay in the

implement the negative cosmological constant arising from the stabilization of
the modulus fields in the KKLT vacua and find that this leads to a successful
reheating in which the energy density of the scalar field effectively scales as
a pressureless dust. The present dark energy can be also explained in our

binding energy configurations of intersecting closed extremal branes. In such
configurations, some branes may open on host closed branes. Properties of
extremal branes reveal symmetries of the underlying theory which are well known
in M-theory but transcend supersymmetry. From these properties it is possible
to reconstruct all actions, comprising in particular pure gravity in D
dimensions, the bosonic effective actions of M-theory and of the bosonic
string, which upon dimensional reduction to three dimensions are invariant
under the maximally non-compact simple simply laced Lie groups G. Moreover the
features of extremal branes suggest the existence of a much larger symmetry,
namely the `very-extended' Kac-Moody algebras G+++. This motivates the
construction of explicit non-linear realisations of all simple G+++, which
hopefully contain new degrees of freedom such as those encountered in string
theories. They are defined without a priori reference to space-time and are
proposed as substitutes for original field theoretic models of gravity, forms
and dilatons. From the G+++ invariant theories, all algebraic properties of
extremal branes are recovered from exact solutions, and there are indications
that space-time is hidden in the infinite symmetry structure. The
transformation properties of the exact solutions, which possibly induce new
solutions foreign to conventional theories, put into evidence the general
group-theoretical origin of `dualities' for all G+++. These dualities
apparently do not require an underlying string theory.

objects form a cyclic group of order n, and which are not tensor equivalent to
a representation category of a Hopf algebra. In a later publication we plan to
use our construction to classify finite tensor categories whose simple objects
form a cyclic group of prime order n. We also prove that if H is a finite
dimensional radically graded quasi-Hopf algebra with H[0]=(C[\Z/n\Z],\Phi),
where n is prime and \Phi is a nontrivial associator, such that H[1] is a free
left module over H[0] of rank 1 (it is always free) then H is isomorphic to

numerically, the large densities and volumes present a significant

computation time and numerical resolution as the density of the plasma grows.
In this paper we present a new technique for mitigating the extreme
computational load as the plasma density grows by combining existing PIC
methods with a dielectric fluid approach. By using both descriptions in a
hybrid particle-fluid model, we now can probe the physics in large volume, high
density regions. The hybrid method also provides a smooth transition as the
plasma density increases and the ionization fraction grows to values that are
well described by the fluid description alone. We present the hybrid technique

This paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of a suspension of

depending on the strength and frequency of the external wave flow, two
orientation regimes of the particles are predicted: a preferential orientation
regime with the particles rotating in coherent fashion with the wave field, and
a random orientation regime in which the particles oscillate around their
initial orientation while diffusing under the effect of Brownian motion. For
both motion regimes, the effective viscosity has been derived as a function of
the wave frequency, wave amplitude and aspect ratio of the particles. Model
predictions have been compared with wave attenuation data in frazil ice layers

found, while we also get some similar conclusions that some simple geometrical
quantities of networks have important impression on infection property of
infectous disease. It seems that in our model even when local cure rate is
greater than inner infection rate in every household, disease still can spread
on scale-free network. It implies that no disease is spreading in every single
household, but for the whole network, disease is spreading. Since our society
network seems like this structure, maybe this conclusion remind us that during
disease spreading we should pay more attention on network structure than local

decomposition of the atomic state space into carrier spaces for the irreducible
representations of the symmetry group $\ZZ_N$ of the circle. It is shown that
the index $p$ of these representations can be used as a quantum number
analogously to the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ in hydrogen-like

which can occupy the central region of the Coulomb potential, the
quasi-particle corresponding to a collective excitation of the atoms in the

level-crossing at certain radii; in the regions between these radii, damped
Rabi oscillations between two ""extreme"" $p=0$ configurations occur. The
physical mechanisms behind super- and subradiance at a given radius and the
divergence of the level shifts at small interatomic distances are discussed. It
