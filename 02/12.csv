Flash (XRF) of July 23 2003. Our observations in the R-band cover the temporal
range from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. We also present the
results of multicolor imaging extending to the K-band on three epochs. The
lightcurve of the R-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar to
the lightcurve for long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), i.e., a broken
power-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (F_nu propto t^alpha).
Furthermore, the spectral energy distribution (SED) has a power-law (F_nu
propto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. However, the decay slope at t<1 day
is shallow, consistent with zero. This is in qualitative agreement with the
prediction that XRFs are off-axis classical GRBs. After the first week there is
a strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. The SED after
the peak becomes significantly redder. We discuss the possible interpretations
of this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likely
explanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of the
SED. Finally, we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglow
and in the bump phase. A firm upper limit of z=2.3 is placed on the redshift of
XRF030723 from the lack of Ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum of the
afterglow. The lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either of
the two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination.

the phase shift between the density and velocity perturbations is not exactly
equal to the quarter of the period, it varies along the loop and is time

Starobinsky suggested an inflationary cosmological scenario in which inflation

the quantum corrections are the quantum fluctuations of the supersymetric

terminate it. Since the MSM is difficult to solve until the end of the

be M_SUSY ~ 10^15 GeV, thus satisfying the requirement that the predicted

early-type systems,a feature that makes them ideal test beds for the analysis
of their ages and metallicities. In the analysis that is based on simple
stellar population models,we find a significant degeneracy between the derived
ages and metallicities both in optical+NIR photometric and NUV spectroscopic
analyses. This degeneracy is not so strong for LBDS~53W069. However even in
this case the stellar age cannot be constrained better than to a range roughly
encompassing one third of the age of the Universe at the observed redshift. We
have explored several independent population synthesis models and consistently
found similar results. Broadband photometry straddling the rest-frame 4000A
break is also subject to a strong age-metallicity degeneracy. The use of
realistic chemical enrichment assumptions significantly helps in disentangling
the degeneracy. Based on this method, we derive the average stellar age for
both galaxies around 3.6-3.8 Gyr with better constraints on the youngest
possible ages. From the observational point of view, the most efficient (and
feasible) way to set limits on unresolved stellar populations comprises a
combination of Balmer absorption lines along with either low SNR rest frame NUV
spectroscopy or accurate optical and NIR photometry.

it provides ~40% of the bolometric contribution, and up to ~80% of that in the

synthesis codes in a number of important ways, namely (1) the incorporation of
new stellar evolutionary tracks, with sufficient resolution in mass to sample
rapid stages of stellar evolution; (2) a physically consistent treatment of
evolution in the HR diagram, including the approach to the main sequence and
the effects of mass loss on the giant and horizontal-branch phases. Unlike
several existing models, ours yield consistent ages when used to date a coeval
stellar population from a wide range of spectral features and colour indexes.
We rigorously discuss degeneracies in the age-metallicity plane and show that
inclusion of spectral features blueward of 4500 AA, suffices to break any
remaining degeneracy and that with moderate S/N spectra (10 per 20AA,
resolution element) age and metallicity are not degenerate. We also study
sources of systematic errors in deriving the age of a single stellar population
and conclude that they are not larger than 10-15%. We illustrate the use of
single stellar populations by predicting the colors of primordial
proto-galaxies and show that one can first find them and then deduce the form
of the IMF for the early generation of stars in the universe. Finally, we
provide accurate analytic fitting formulas for ultra fast computation of colors

While the orbital periodicity was present throughout our data, only one of the
shorter periods was detectable at any given time. On a time-scale of ~90 days,
the short-period modulation in the light curve of the star changed three times
between the spin period and the beat. On longer time-scales, we report two
outbursts of V1062 Tau (the first to be recorded for this object) - both of
which were probably short, low-amplitude ones (dm ~1.2 mag). Our data also
suggest a brief low state phase in 2002 Jan. Thus, this system joins two
exclusive groups of intermediate polars: those undergoing short outbursts, and
those having low states. We propose that the alternations between the short
periods that modulate the light curve were caused by changes in the accretion
mode, from disc-fed accretion, to disc-overflow accretion. We further suggest
that these changes may have been triggered by changes in mass-transfer rate,
which were manifested by the low-state/outburst activity of the system.

density regions. We find an apparent absence of galaxies on the red
colour-magnitude sequence below z'~24.2, corresponding to ~M*+2 (~10^{10} Msun)
with respect to passively evolving galaxies at z~1. Galaxies brighter than
M*-0.5 (8 x 10^{10} Msun), however, are predominantly red passively evolving
systems, with few blue star forming galaxies at these magnitudes.
  This apparent age gradient, where massive galaxies are dominated by old
stellar populations while less massive galaxies have more extended star
formation histories, supports the `down-sizing' idea where the mass of galaxies
hosting star formation decreases as the Universe ages. Combined with the lack
of evolution in the shape of the stellar mass function for massive galaxies
since at least z~1, it appears that galaxy formation processes (both star
formation and mass assembly) should have occurred in an accelerated way in
massive systems in high density regions, while these processes should have been
slower in smaller systems. This result provides an interesting challenge for
modern CDM-based galaxy formation theories which predict later formation epochs

6.85 magnitudes which corresponds to a mean effective radius of 122 (77) km if
an albedo of 0.04 (0.10) is assumed. This is the first known Kuiper Belt object
and only the third minor planet with a radius > 25 km to display a lightcurve
with a range in excess of 1 magnitude. We find the colors to be typical for a
Kuiper Belt object (B-V = 1.00 +- 0.04, V-R = 0.60 +- 0.02) with no variation
in color between minimum and maximum light. The large light variation,
relatively long double-peaked period and absence of rotational color change
argue against explanations due to albedo markings or elongation due to high
angular momentum. Instead, we suggest that 2001 QG298 may be a very close or
contact binary similar in structure to what has been independently proposed for
the Trojan asteroid 624 Hektor. If so, its rotational period would be twice the
lightcurve period or 13.7744 +- 0.0004 hr. By correcting for the effects of
projection, we estimate that the fraction of similar objects in the Kuiper Belt
is at least 10% to 20% with the true fraction probably much higher. A high
abundance of close and contact binaries is expected in some scenarios for the
evolution of binary Kuiper Belt objects.

in the literature regarding fundamental aspects of the expansion of the
universe and cosmic horizons and we link these concepts to observational tests.
We derive the dynamics of a non-comoving galaxy and use this to demonstrate the
counter-intuitive result that objects at constant proper distance can have a
non-zero redshift. Receding galaxies can be blueshifted and approaching
galaxies can be redshifted, even in an empty universe for which one might
expect special relativity to apply.
  We then test the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSL) and its
extension to incorporate cosmological event horizons. In spite of the fact that
cosmological horizons do not generally have well-defined thermal properties, we
find that the GSL is satisfied for a wide range of models. We explore in
particular the relative entropic 'worth' of black hole versus cosmological
horizon area. An intriguing set of models show an apparent entropy decrease but
we anticipate this apparent violation of the GSL will disappear when solutions
are available for black holes embedded in arbitrary backgrounds.
  Recent evidence suggests a small increase in the fine structure constant
(alpha =e^2/hbar c) over cosmological time scales. This raises the question of
which fundamental quantities are truly constant and which might vary. We show
that black hole thermodynamics may provide a means to discriminate between
alternative theories invoking varying constants, because some variations in the
fundamental 'constants' could lead to a violation of the generalized second law
of thermodynamics.

of detailed supernova progenitor models, however, was so far prevented by
various physical and numerical difficulties in simulating binary systems with
an accreting white dwarf component, e.g., unstable helium shell burning which
may cause significant expansion and mass loss. Here, we present the first
binary evolution calculation which models both stellar components and the
binary interaction simultaneously, and where the white dwarf mass grows up to
the Chandrasekhar limit by mass accretion. Our model starts with a 1.6 Msun
helium star and a 1.0 Msun CO white dwarf in a 0.124 day orbit. Thermally
unstable mass transfer starts when the CO core of the helium star reaches 0.53
Msun, with mass transfer rates of 1...8 times 10^{-6} Msun/yr. The white dwarf
burns the accreted helium steadily until the white dwarf mass has reached ~ 1.3
Msun and weak thermal pulses follow until carbon ignites in the center when the
white dwarf reaches 1.37 Msun. Although the supernova production rate through
this channel is not well known, and this channel can not be the only one as its

Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitors. Starting with a slowly rotating white dwarf,
we simulate the accretion of matter and angular momentum from a quasi-Keplerian
accretion disk. The role of the various rotationally induced hydrodynamic
instabilities for the transport of angular momentum inside the white dwarf is
investigated. We find that the dynamical shear instability is the most
important one in the highly degenerate core. Our results imply that accreting
white dwarfs rotate differentially throughout,with a shear rate close to the
threshold value for the onset of the dynamical shear instability. As the latter
depends on the temperature of the white dwarf, the thermal evolution of the
white dwarf core is found to be relevant for the angular momentum
redistribution. As found previously, significant rotation is shown to lead to
carbon ignition masses well above 1.4 Msun. Our models suggest a wide range of
white dwarf explosion masses, which could be responsible for some aspects of
the diversity observed in SNe Ia. We analyze the potential role of the bar-mode
and the r-mode instability in rapidly rotating white dwarfs, which may impose
angular momentum loss by gravitational wave radiation. We discuss the
consequences of the resulting spin-down for the fate of the white dwarf, and
the possibility to detect the emitted gravitational waves at frequencies of 0.1
>... 1.0 Hz in nearby galaxies with LISA. Possible implications of fast and
differentially rotating white dwarf cores for the flame propagation in

spun-up layers. As a result, helium ignites much earlier and under much less
degenerate conditions compared to the corresponding non-rotating case.
Consequently, a helium detonation may be avoided, which questions the

edge in the persistent emission spectrum. The edge energy decreases to 0.87 keV
during deep dipping intervals. The detected feature may result from edges of

dispersion is strongly affected by the spin resonance and displays an S-shape
whose magnitude scales with the resonance intensity. For nodal fermions,
relevant spin excitations do not have resonance behavior, rather they are
better characterized as a gapped continuum. As a consequence, the S-shape
becomes a kink, and superconductivity does not affect the dispersion as

outside the regime of validity of linear response and to first order in the

structures. In the blatant distinction from regular networks of the ""small
world"" (SW) topology [1], regular fractal networks manifests the logarithmic
dependence of the characteristic path length on number of vertices N which is
typically just for random networks. Due to this fact, for the hierarchic
networks there is no effect of an abrupt drop of the mean path length caused by
the introduction into a regular structure only a few random edges. The
clustering coefficient of the hierarchic structures is equal zero and in a
process of randomization it slightly grows up to the random networks value k/N,
where k is mean number of the nearest neighbors, in vivid contrast with the
small world networks behavior. We considered also the problem of unification of
two isolated SW and Caley tree networks in the limits of weak (through one
point) and strong (many points) connection and deduced a specific algebra for
the mean path length of the unified network in terms of the isolated networks
path lengths. The sewing together of the tree-like networks may be performed in
the one-bottom point or in the crown top to crown top manners. In such a way we
come to the concept of bi-trees of two types having different topologies. We
demonstrated the difference between two possible probabilistic models of
introducing randomness: the model with substitution of a certain number of cut
off links of the regular lattice by the equal number of edges stochastically
distributed over the lattice (totally random model) and the artillery model,
when one end of the broken link remains connected with the origin lattice.

which aspects of both static and dynamic systems behavior can be captured via
descriptive models and meta-models. The proposed architecture embodies four
main elements - firstly, the adoption of a multi-layered meta-modeling
architecture and reflective meta-level architecture, secondly the
identification of four data modeling relationships that can be made explicit
such that they can be modified dynamically, thirdly the identification of five
design patterns which have emerged from practice and have proved essential in
providing reusable building blocks for data management, and fourthly the
encoding of the structural properties of the five design patterns by means of
one fundamental pattern, the Graph pattern. A practical example of this
philosophy, the CRISTAL project, is used to demonstrate the use of
description-driven data objects to handle system evolution.

of models where partially degenerate neutrinos are as natural as hierarchical

determines the neutrino mass scale, is forced to be proportional to the unit
matrix by a SO(3) flavour symmetry. The type I see-saw part of the neutrino
mass matrix, which controls the mass squared differences and mixing angles, may
be governed by sequential right-handed neutrino dominance and a natural
alignment for the SO(3)-breaking vacuum. We focus on classes of models with
bi-large mixing originating from the neutrino mass matrix although we also
briefly discuss other classes of models where large mixing stems from the
charged lepton mass matrix. We study renormalization group corrections to the
neutrino mass squared differences and mixings and find that the low energy
values do not depend sensitively on the high energy values for partially
degenerate neutrinos with a mass scale up to about 0.15 eV. Our scenario
predicts the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay to be
approximately equal to the neutrino mass scale and therefore neutrinoless
double beta decay will be observable if the neutrino mass spectrum is partially
degenerate. We also find that all observable CP phases as well as $\theta_{13}$
become small as the neutrino mass scale increases.

of its naturalness but also because of another reason. Its energy scale
determined by the COBE normalization is 10^15 - 10^16 GeV. It happens to be the
energy scale of interest in particle physics, namely, the mass scale of
right-handed neutrinos or the energy scale of the gauge-coupling unification.
It is true that topological defects are produced after the hybrid inflation if
it is related to a U(1)_B-L or a GUT-symmetry breaking, and hence one cannot
naively identify models of particle physics with that of inflation. But those
defects are not necessarily found in modified models. We show in this article
that quite a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric hybrid inflation
model is free from monopoles or cosmic strings. Moreover, it happens to be
exactly the same as a well-motivated extension of SU(5)-unified theories. The
vacuum energy is dominated by F-term. The \eta-problem is not necessarily
serious when the model is realized by D-branes. Although it has been considered
that a coupling constant has to be very small when the vacuum energy is
dominated by F-term, this constraint is not applied either to the D-brane
model. They are due to a particular form of the Kahler potential and
interaction of the model. Reheating process is also discussed.

the compact volume is large in string units, the string coupling is weak, and
string perturbation theory is valid. We show that at least two light chiral

sufficient to obtain a minimum with an acceptably small and negative
cosmological constant. We discuss cosmological issues of the scenario and the
possible role of anthropic considerations in choosing the vacuum of the theory.

functions to nuclei and nuclear matter are reviewed. Particular attention is
given to the description of experimental data obtained from the (e,e'p) and
(e,e'2N) reactions that determine one and two-nucleon removal probabilities in
nuclei since the corresponding amplitudes are directly related to the imaginary
parts of the single-particle and two-particle propagators. For this reason and
the fact that these amplitudes can now be calculated with the inclusion of all
the relevant physical processes, it is useful to explore the efficacy of the
method of self-consistent Green's functions in describing these experimental
data. Results for both finite nuclei and nuclear matter are discussed with
particular emphasis on clarifying the role of short-range correlations in
determining various experimental quantities. The important role of long-range
correlations in determining the structure of low-energy correlations is also
documented. For a complete understanding of nuclear phenomena it is therefore
essential to include both types of physical correlations. We demonstrate that
recent experimental results for these reactions combined with the reported
theoretical calculations yield a very clear understanding of the properties of
{\em all} protons in the nucleus. We propose that this knowledge of the
properties of constituent fermions in a correlated many-body system is a unique
feature of nuclear physics.

restrictive disease of lungs, suffering from bronchial asthma were studied
before and after BI by plotting volume, rate flow, against the transpulmonare

change after BI of Cdyn, Cdyn at once after flow interruption (Cdyn1), tissue
resistance at inhalation (Rti in) and exhalation (Rti ex), parameters of
ventilating and general parameters of respiratory mechanics. Results: the
parameters of ventilating were improved (P < 0,05). General parameters of

1. The decrease of ventilation nonequality and tissue friction after BI do not
influence on the initially reduced dynamic compliance of lungs at asthma
patients without any restrictive diseases of lungs. 2. The cause of not
increasing of dynamic compliance after BI probably due by changes in elastic

Several global topological parameters (such as node connectivity, average

protein-protein interaction networks (PINs). The logarithm of the connectivity
distribution vs. the logarithm of connectivity study indicated that PINs follow
a power law (P(k) ~ k-\gamma) behavior. Using the regression analysis method we
determined that \gamma lies between 1.5 and 2.4, for the seven species.
Correlation analysis provides good evidence supporting the fact that the seven
PINs form a scale-free network. The average diameters of the networks and their
randomized version are found to have large difference. We also demonstrated
that the interaction networks are quite robust when subject to random
perturbation. Average node connectivity correlation study supports the earlier
results that nodes of low connectivity are correlated, whereas nodes of high
connectivity are not directly linked. These results provided some evidence
suggesting such correlation relations might be a general feature of the PINs

single-spin detection for readout remains a crucial unsolved problem. Schemes
based on adiabatically induced spin-dependent electron tunnelling between
individual donor atoms, detected using a single electron transistor (SET) as an
ultra-sensitive electrometer, are thought to be problematic because of the low
ionisaton energy of the final D- state. In this paper we analyse the adiabatic
scheme in detail. We find that despite significant stabilization due to the
presence of the D+, the field strengths required for the transition lead to a
shortened dwell-time placing severe constraints on the SET measurement time. We
therefore investigate a new method based on resonant electron transfer, which
operates with much reduced field strengths. Various issues in the
implementation of this method are also discussed.

microcavity. The analytical expressions of the light intensity for the cases of
excitonic number state and coherent state are presented by using secular
approximation. Our results show that the effective exciton-exciton interaction
leads to the appearance of collapse and revival of the light intensity. The
revival time is twice compared the coherent state case with that of the number
state. The dissipation of the exciton-polariton lowers the revival amplitude
but does not alter the revival time. The influences of the detuning and the
phase-space filling are studied. We find that the effect of the higher-order
exciton-photon interaction may be removed by adjusting the detuning.

spontaneous localization of a quantum state. The model is similar to the
Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber model, while we postulate the localization functions to
depend on the quantum state to suffer collapse. According to the model, dual
dynamics in quantum mechanics, deterministic and stochastic time evolution, are
algorithmically implemented in tandem. After discussing the physical
implications of the model qualitatively, we present numerical results for
one-dimensional systems by way of example.

such channels and initial entangled (singlet) state the entropy of the output

gives a certain moral support to the additivity hypothesis. Another related
simple function of the channel (minimum entropy gain) is shown to be additive

systems containing both boson and fermion operators. In this note we consider
the normal ordering problem for a string of such operators. In the general
case, upon which we touch briefly, this problem leads to combinatorial numbers,
the so-called Rook numbers. Since we assume that the two species, bosons and
fermions, commute, we subsequently restrict ourselves to consideration of a
single species, single-mode boson monomials. This problem leads to elegant
generalisations of well-known combinatorial numbers, specifically Bell and
Stirling numbers. We explicitly give the generating functions for some classes
of these numbers. In this note we concentrate on the combinatorial graph
approach, showing how some important classical results of graph theory lead to
transparent representations of the combinatorial numbers associated with the
boson normal ordering problem.

A, v70, 053802 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevA.70.053802",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the use of electromagnetically modified absorption to achieve
selective excitation in atoms: that is, the laser excitation of one transition
while avoiding simultaneously exciting another transition whose frequency is
the same as or close to that of the first. The selectivity which can be
achieved in the presence of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is
limited by the decoherence rate of the dark state. We present exact analytical
expressions for this effect, and also physical models and approximate
expressions which give useful insights into the phenomena. When the laser
frequencies are near-resonant with the single-photon atomic transitions, EIT is
essential for achieving discrimination. When the laser frequencies are far
detuned, the `bright' two-photon Raman resonance is important for achieving
selective excitation, while the `dark' resonance (EIT) need not be. The
application to laser cooling of a trapped atom is also discussed.
