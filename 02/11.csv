distant galaxies. The observed SEDs are fitted by combining single stellar
populations, with different SFRs and amounts of dust extinction. This approach
gives us the best flexibility when dealing with the widest variety of physical
situation for the target galaxies. In particular we tested the code on three
classes of sources: dusty ISO-selected starbursts, K-band selected
ellipticals/S0s and z=2-3 Lyman-break galaxies. We pay particular attention in
evaluating the uncertainties in the stellar mass estimate, due to degeneracies
in the physical parameters, different SFHs or metallicities. Based on
optical-NIR photometric data, the stellar masses are found to have overall
uncertainties of a factor of ~2 for E/S0s, ~2-5 for the starbursts population,
and up to 10 for Ly-break galaxies. In any case the latter appear to correspond
to a galaxy population significantly less massive than those observed at lower
redshifts, possibly indicating substantial stellar build-up at z~1-2 in the
field galaxy population. Using simulated deep SIRTF/IRAC observations of
starbursts and Lyman-break galaxies, we investigate how an extension of the
wavelength dynamic range will decrease the uncertainties in the stellar mass
estimate, and find that they will reduce for both classes to factors of 2-3,
good enough for statistically reliable determinations of the galaxy
evolutionary mass functions.

this assumption which uses a statistic that proves to be particularly
well-suited to detecting and quantifying weak correlations with environment. We
find that close pairs of haloes form at slightly higher redshifts than do more
widely separated halo pairs, suggesting that haloes in dense regions form at
slightly earlier times than do haloes of the same mass in less dense regions.

certain excited levels of H2. We simulate a 1D plane-parallel atmosphere to
estimate fluxes for the 140 observed H2 emission lines and to reconstruct the
Ly-alpha emission profile incident upon the warm H2. The excitation of H2 can
be determined from relative line strengths by measuring self-absorption in
lines with low-energy lower levels, or by reconstructing the Ly-alpha profile
incident upon the warm H2 using the total flux from a single upper level and
the opacity in the pumping transition. Based on those diagnostics, we estimate
that the warm disk surface has a column density of log

factor of H2, as seen by the source of Ly-alpha emission, of 0.25\pm0.08 (all

density, the mean background is strongly sensitive to the spatial clumping of
free electrons. Using several existing models for the clumping of ionized gas,
we find that the expected free-free distortion to the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) blackbody spectrum is at a level detectable with upcoming
experiments such as the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and
Diffuse Emission (ARCADE). However, the dominant contribution to the distortion
comes from clumpy gas at z < 3, and the integrated signal does not strongly
constrain the epoch of reionization. In addition to the mean emission, we
consider spatial fluctuations in the free-free background and the extent to
which these anisotropies confuse the search for fluctuations in 21 cm line
emission from neutral hydrogen during and prior to reionization. This
background is smooth in frequency space and hence can be removed through
frequency differencing, but only so long as the 21 cm signal and the free-free
emission are uncorrelated. We show that, because the free-free background is
generated primarily at low redshifts, the cross-correlation between the two
fields is smaller than a few percent. Thus, multifrequency cleaning should be
an effective way to eliminate the free-free confusion.

photoevaporative outflows with hydrodynamic simulations. General results from
the simulations agree well with the analytic predictions, although some small
differences are present. Most importantly, the flow of material from the disk
surface develops at smaller radii than in the analytic approximations and the
flow-velocity from the disk surface is only one-third the sound speed. A
detailed presentation of observational consequences of the model is given,
including predicted line widths, blue-shifts, and integrated luminosities of

under-predict these forbidden line luminosities. However, the present model

I, we used redshifts within $\sim 10\Mpc$ of the centers of the clusters to

distribution of the galaxies. Here, we use 2MASS photometry and an additional
\ncziinew redshifts to investigate the environmental dependence of
near-infrared mass-to-light ratios. In the virial regions, the halo occupation
function is non-linear; the number of bright galaxies per halo increases more
slowly than the mass of the halo. On larger scales, the light contained in
galaxies is less clustered than the mass in rich clusters. Specifically, the
mass-to-light ratio inside the virial radius is a factor of $1.8\pm0.3$ larger
than that outside the virial radius. This difference could result from changing
fractions of baryonic to total matter or from variations in the efficiency of
galaxy formation or disruption with environment. The average mass-to-light
ratio $M/L_K = 53\pm 5 h$ implies $\Omega_m = 0.18\pm 0.03$ (statistical) using
the luminosity density based on 2dFGRS data. These results are difficult to
reconcile with independent methods which suggest higher $\Omega_m$. Reconciling
these values by invoking bias requires that the typical value of $M/L_K$
changes significantly at densities of $\lesssim3\rho_c$.

Herbig-Haro outflow. Its mid-IR emission appears slightly resolved with a
diameter of ~16 AU, possibly tracing circumstellar material from both the
envelope and the disk. VLA 2 is a typical Class I object, unresolved in the
mid-IR, and is the responsible of the strong X-ray emission associated with YLW

Earth's geocorona as the mechanism for this emission. We present a theoretical
model of geocoronal emission and show that predicted spectra and intensities
match the Chandra observations very well. We also model the closely related
process of heliospheric charge transfer and estimate that the total charge
transfer flux observed from Earth amounts to a significant fraction of the soft

the morphology and extension of the sub-arcsecond nebulae observed in massive

is well constrained from the nebula opening angle. Our simulations indicate
that to constrain the outflow cavity shape and the degree of flattening in the

source, suggesting that M87 is a mis-aligned BL Lac object. Its unresolved
nuclear region emits strong non-thermal emission from radio to X-rays which has
been interpreted as synchrotron radiation. In an earlier paper we predicted M87
as a source of detectable gamma ray emission in the context of the hadronic
Synchrotron-Proton Blazar (SPB) model. The subsequent tentative detection of
TeV energy photons by the HEGRA-telescope array would, if confirmed, make it
the first radio galaxy to be detected at TeV-energies. We discuss the emission
from the unresolved nuclear region of M87 in the context of the SPB model, and
give examples of possible model representations of its non-simultaneous
spectral energy distribution. The low-energy component can be explained as
synchrotron radiation by a primary relativistic electron population that is
injected together with energetic protons into a highly magnetized emission
region. We find that the gamma-ray power output is dominated either by
mu/pi-synchrotron or proton synchrotron radiation depending on whether the
primary electron synchrotron component peaks at low or high energies,
respectively. The predicted gamma-ray luminosity peaks at around 100 GeV at a
level comparable to that of the low-energy hump, and this makes M87 a promising
candidate source for the newly-commissioned high-sensitivity low-threshold

candidates for qubits in quantum computer proposals. Shallow donor exchange
gates are frequently invoked to preform two-qubit operations in such proposals.
We study shallow donor electron properties in Si within the Kohn-Luttinger
envelope function approach, incorporating the full Bloch states of the six band
edges of Si conduction band, obtained from {\it ab initio} calculations within
the density-functional and pseudopotential frameworks. Inter-valley
interference between the conduction-band-edge states of Si leads to oscillatory
behavior in the charge distribution of one-electron bound states and in the
exchange coupling in two-electron states. The behavior in the donor electron
charge distribution is strongly influenced by interference from the plane-wave
and periodic parts of the Bloch functions. For two donors, oscillations in the
exchange coupling calculated within the Heitler-London (HL) approach are due to
the plane-wave parts of the Bloch functions alone, which are pinned to the
impurity sites. The robustness of this result is assessed by relaxing the phase
pinning to the donor sites. We introduce a more general theoretical scheme, the
floating-phase HL, from which the previously reported donor exchange
oscillatory behavior is qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed. The
floating-phase formalism provides a ``handle'' on how to theoretically
anticipate the occurrence of oscillatory behavior in electronic properties
associated with electron bound states in more general confining potentials,

an explanation of how it can arise from a more basic underlying mechanism of
competition between opposing forces.
  We introduce a family of one-dimensional geometric growth models, constructed
iteratively by locally optimizing the tradeoffs between two competing metrics.
This family admits an equivalent description as a graph process with no
reference to the underlying geometry. Moreover, the resulting graph process is
shown to be preferential attachment with an upper cutoff. We rigorously
determine the degree distribution for the family of random graph models,
showing that it obeys a power law up to a finite threshold and decays
exponentially above this threshold.
  We also introduce and rigorously analyze a generalized version of our graph
process, with two natural parameters, one corresponding to the cutoff and the
other a ``fertility'' parameter. Limiting cases of this process include the
standard Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model and the uniform
attachment model. In the general case, we prove that the process has a power
law degree distribution up to a cutoff, and establish monotonicity of the power

Functionals are proposed suitable for short-range Coulomb-cusp correlation and
for long-range polarization response correlation. A linearized variational

surprisingly large branching ratio represents a challenge for theory, and
complements the amazingly small B_d -> pi^+ pi^- rate. We point out that all
puzzling B -> pi pi features can be accommodated in the Standard Model (SM)
through non-factorizable hadronic interference effects, extract the relevant
parameters, and predict the CP asymmetries of B_d -> pi^0 pi^0. Using then
SU(3) flavour-symmetry and plausible dynamical assumptions, we fix the hadronic
B -> pi K parameters through their B -> pi pi counterparts, and determine the
CKM angle gamma, with a result in remarkable accordance with the usual fits for
the unitarity triangle. We may then analyse the B -> pi K system in the SM,
where we find agreement with the experimental picture, with the exception of
those observables that are significantly affected by electroweak (EW) penguins,
thereby suggesting new physics (NP) in this sector. Indeed, a moderate
enhancement of these topologies and a large CP-violating NP phase allow us to
describe any currently observed feature of the B -> pi K modes, and to predict
the CP-violating B_d -> pi^0 K_S observables. If we then restrict ourselves to
a specific scenario where NP enters only through Z^0 penguins, we obtain a link
to rare K and B decays, where the most spectacular NP effects are an
enhancement of the K_L -> pi^0 nu nu_bar rate by one order of magnitude with
BR(K_L -> pi^0 nu nu_bar) ~ 4 BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nu_bar), BR(K_L -> pi^0 e^+

the superpotential includes only renormalizable terms, thereby limiting the
number of free parameters and (ii) the triplet term in the type II seesaw
formula for neutrino mass dominates, leading to the sum rule M_nu = c(M_d -
M_e) that is responsible for large mixings. However, CKM CP phase is
constrained to be in the second or third quadrant requiring a significant
non-CKM component to CP violation to explain observations. We revisit this
issue using type I seesaw formula for neutrino masses and obtain the following
results: (i) we show that the above sumrule responsible for large mixing angles
can also emerge in type I seesaw models; the detailed predictions are however
not compatible with present data for any choice of CP phases. (ii) We then show
that addition of a nonrenormalizable term restores compatibility with neutrino
data and CKM CP violation both in type I and type II cases. We further find
that (iii) the MSSM parameter tan beta > 30 in the type I model and (iv) lepton
flavor violation and lepton electric dipole moments which are accessible to
proposed experiments in both type I and type II models. We also discuss the

particle production is used to reheat the universe. This reheating mechanism is

violate nucleosynthesis constraints and invalidate the model. We describe a new
method of realizing quintessential inflation on the brane in which inflation is
followed by `instant preheating' (Felder, Kofman & Linde 1999). The larger
reheating temperature in this model results in a smaller amplitude of relic
gravity waves which is consistent with nucleosynthesis bounds. The relic

flows are strongly self-averaging and super-diffusive: the delay $\tau(r)$ for
any finite number of passive tracers initially close to separate till a
distance $r$ is almost surely anomalously fast ($\tau(r)\sim r^{2-\nu}$, with
$\nu>0$). This strong self-averaging property is such that the dissipative
power of the flow compensates its convective power at every scale. However as
the circulation increase in the eddies the transport behavior of the flow may
(discontinuously) bifurcate and become ruled by deterministic chaos: the
self-averaging property collapses and advection dominates dissipation. When the
flow is anisotropic a new formula describing turbulent conductivity is
identified.

(2), Vol. 157 (2003), no. 1, 257--288",,,"math.FA",,"  A well-known open question is whether every countable collection of Lipschitz
functions on a Banach space X with separable dual has a common point of Frechet
differentiability. We show that the answer is positive for some
infinite-dimensional X. Previously, even for collections consisting of two
functions this has been known for finite-dimensional X only (although for one
function the answer is known to be affirmative in full generality). Our aims
are achieved by introducing a new class of null sets in Banach spaces (called
$\Gamma$-null sets), whose definition involves both the notions of category and
measure, and showing that the required differentiability holds almost
everywhere with respect to it. We even obtain existence of Fr\'echet
derivatives of Lipschitz functions between certain infinite-dimensional Banach
spaces;no such results have been known previously. Our main result states that
a Lipschitz map between separable Banach spaces is Fr\'echet differentiable
$\Gamma$-almost everywhere provided that it is regularly Gateaux differentiable
$\Gamma$-almost everywhere and the Gateaux derivatives stay within a norm
separable space of operators. It is easy to see that Lipschitz maps of X to
spaces with the Radon-Nikodym property are Gateaux differentiable
$\Gamma$-almost everywhere. Moreover, Gateaux differentiability implies regular
Gateaux differentiability with exception of another kind of negligible sets,
so-called $\sigma$-porous sets. The answer to the question is therefore
positive in every space in which every $\sigma$-porous set is $\Gamma$-null. We
show that this holds for $C(K)$ with $K$ countable compact, the Tsirelson space
and for all subspaces of $c_0$, but that it fails for Hilbert spaces.

fourth-order tensor invariant for such distributions, using his
""reduction-prolongation"" procedure. After Cartan's work the following questions
remained open: first the geometric reason for existence of Cartan's tensor was
not clear; secondly it was not clear how to generalize this tensor to other
classes of distributions; finally there were no explicit formulas for
computation of Cartan's tensor. Our paper is the first in the series of papers,
where we develop an alternative approach, which gives the answers to the
questions mentioned above. It is based on the investigation of dynamics of the
field of so-called abnormal extremals (singular curves) of rank 2 distribution
and on the general theory of unparametrized curves in the Lagrange
Grassmannian, developed in our previous works with A. Agrachev . In this way we
construct the fundamental form and the projective Ricci curvature of rank 2
vector distributions for arbitrary n greater than 4.
  For n=5 we give an explicit method for computation of these invariants and
demonstrate it on several examples. In our next paper we show that in the case
n=5 our fundamental form coincides with Cartan's tensor.

of perturbed integrable evolution equations. One is then forced to account for
them by the Normal Form, which is the dynamical equation obeyed by the
zero-order term. This spoils the integrability of the normal form, and the
simple wave-nature of the zero-order approximation. To avoid both undesired
results, one must require that the obstacles be accounted for by the
higher-order terms in the expansion of the solution (the Near-Identity
Transformation). We show that this goal can be achieved if the higher-order
terms are allowed to depend explicitly on the independent variables,t and x (an
option that is not considered in the standard NF analysis). In addition, a
particular algorithm for the construction of the NIT leads to a canonical form
for the obstacles; they are expressed in terms of the symmetries of the
unperturbed equation. The canonical form ensures the explicit vanishing of the
obstacles in the case of a single-wave zero-order solution. In the case of a
multiple-wave solution, the effect of the canonical obstacles on the
higher-order terms in the NIT is confined to the region of interaction among
the waves. This often facilitates the derivation of closed-form expressions for
the asymptotic effect of the obstacles. These ideas are demonstrated for the
cases of the perturbed Burgers and heat diffusion equations.

forces, fixed so as to obtain in infinite nuclear matter the pairing gaps
provided by the Gogny force or by induced interactions. It is shown that the
nuclear clusters can either suppress or enhance the pairing correlations inside
the inner crust matter, depending on the density of the surrounding neutrons.
The profile of the pairing field in the inner crust is rather similar for both
pairing forces, but the values of the pairing gaps are drastically reduced for
the force which simulates the polarisation effects in infinite neutron matter.

with the data, in spite of considerable errors in reaction Q values. This
suggests some error cancellation, possibly with the relative kinetic energy
term. Calculated berrier heights are consistent with the idea of fusion
hindrance in tip collisions. Adiabatic potentials differ considerably from the

collision history of the two particles can be easily inferred from the

that three elastic particles on an infinite line and three particles on a

infinite wedge and on on a triangular billiard table. It is shown how to
determine the angles of these two sets in terms of the particle masses.

at a future high energy linear collider. To improve the resolution a new
readout based on micro-pattern gas detectors is being developed. Measurements
of the spatial resolution of cosmic-ray tracks in a GEM TPC are presented. We
find that the resolution suffers if the readout pads are too wide with respect
to the charge distribution at the readout plane due to insufficient charge
sharing. For narrow pads of 2 x 6 mm**2 we measure a resolution of 100
micometer at short drift distances in the absence of an axial magnetic field.
The dependence of the spatial resolution as a function of drift distance allows
the determination of the underlying electron statistics. Our results show that
the present technique uses about half the statistical power available from the
number of primary electrons. The track angle effect is observed as expected.

numerically using a representative Faraday chiral medium, arising from the
homogenization of an isotropic chiral medium and a magnetically biased ferrite.
It is demonstrated that the phase velocity may be directed opposite to power
flow, provided that the gyrotropic parameter of the ferrite component medium is
sufficiently large compared with the corresponding nongyrotropic permeability

fluctuations should themselves be studied as a source of valuable information
about the underlying dynamics of genetic networks. By analyzing microarray data
taken from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that correlations in
expression fluctuations have a highly statistically significant dependence on
gene function, and furthermore exhibit a remarkable scale-free network
structure. We therefore present what we view to be the simplest
phenomenological model of a genetic network which can account for the presence
of biological information in transcript level fluctuations. We proceed to
exactly solve this model using a path integral technique and derive several
quantitative predictions. Finally, we propose several experiments by which
these predictions might be rigorously tested.

synaptic currents can be treated as Gaussian noise, the mean and
autocorrelation function of which are calculated self-consistently from the
firing statistics of single model neurons. Within this description, we find
that the irregularity of spike trains is controlled mainly by the strength of
the synapses relative to the difference between the firing threshold and the

synapses we find spike statistics very similar to those observed in primary

an extension of the model to describe an orientation hypercolumn provides

layers. Microelectromagnets can produce strong magnetic fields to stably
manipulate magnetically tagged biological systems in a fluid. Moreover, by
controlling the currents flowing through the wires, a microelectromagnet matrix
can move a peak in the magnetic field magnitude continuously over the surface

independently. These capabilities of a matrix can be used to trap, continuously
