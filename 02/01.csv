which is designed to assess the influence of additive and multiplicative

field in the subcritical case. Our model incorporates random fluctuations in
the $\alpha -$parameter and additive noise arising from the small-scale
fluctuations of magnetic and turbulent velocity fields. We show that the noise
effects along with non-normality can lead to the stochastic amplification of
the magnetic field even in the subcritical case. The criteria for the
stochastic instability during the early kinematic stage are established and the
critical value for the intensity of multiplicative noise due to $\alpha

solar neutrinos and neutrinos released from supernovae. The CLEAN concept is
based on the detection of elastic scattering events (neutrino-electron
scattering and neutrino-nuclear scattering) in liquified noble gases such as
liquid helium, liquid neon, and liquid xenon, all of which scintillate brightly
in the ultraviolet. Key to the CLEAN technique is the use of a thin film of
wavelength-shifting fluor to convert the ultraviolet scintillation light to the
visible. This allows the same liquid to be used as both a passive shielding
medium and an active self-shielding detector, allowing lower intrinsic
radioactive backgrounds at low energies. Liquid neon is a particularly
promising medium for CLEAN. Because liquid neon has a high scintillation yield,
has no long-lived radioactive isotopes, and can be easily purified by use of
cold traps, it is an ideal medium for the detection of rare nuclear events. In
addition, neon is inexpensive, dense, and transparent to its own scintillation
light, making it practical for use in a large self-shielding apparatus. Monte
Carlo simulations of gamma ray backgrounds have been performed assuming liquid
neon as both shielding and detection medium. Gamma ray events occur with high
probability in the outer parts of the detector. In contrast, neutrino
scattering events occur uniformly throughout the detector. We discriminate
background gamma ray events from events of interest based on a spatial Maximum
Likelihood method estimate of event location. Background estimates for CLEAN
are presented, as well as an evaluation of the sensitivity of the detector for
$p-p$ neutrinos. Given these simulations, the physics potential of the CLEAN
approach is evaluated.

describes the trend of the current neutrino oscillation data, in particular the
recent SNO and KAMLAND results. The significant feature of TBM in this respect
is |U_e2|^2=|U_m2|^2=|U_t2|^2=1/3, and we say that the nu_2 is tri-maximally
mixed. We have generalised the TBM ansatz to a generic mixing matrix with the
nu_2 trimaximally mixed, whereby the neutrino mass matrix in the lepton flavour
basis takes the form of a general S3 group matrix (3 x 3 `magic-square'). In
exact TBM the charged-lepton mass matrix in the neutrino mass basis (where the
neutrino mass matrix is diagonal) takes the form of a general S3 class
operator. The neutrino mass matrix in the flavour basis is a particular S3
group matrix which is also an S1 C S2 C S3 group-chain class operator, whereby
the neutrino mass eigenstates are distinguished by their `mutativity' (M_i =
+/-1) and `democracy' (D_i = 0,3) which are both good quantum numbers in exact
TBM.

properties: QCD sum rules and constituent quark models. Making use of the
dispersion formulation of the quark model, we show that both approaches lead to
similar spectral representations for hadron observables with an important
difference that quark model is based on Feynman diagrams with massive quarks,
whereas QCD sum rules are based on the same Feynman diagrams for current quarks
with the additional condensate contributions for light quarks and gluons. We
give arguments for a similarity of the smearing function in sum rules and the
hadron wave function of the quark model. Analyzing the sum rule for the
leptonic decay constant of the heavy pseudoscalar meson containing a light $u$
or $s$ quark, we find that the quark condensates at the chiral
symmetry-breaking scale $\mu_\chi\simeq 1$ GeV, $<\bar u u > = - (230 \pm 15
{\rm MeV})^3$ and $<\bar s s > = - (220 \pm 15 {\rm MeV})^3$ correspond to
constituent quark masses $m_u\simeq 220$ MeV and $m_s \simeq 350$ MeV,
respectively. We also obtain the running of the quark model parameters above
the chiral scale $\mu_\chi$. The observed correspondence between constituent
quark models and QCD sum rules allows a deeper understanding of both methods
and their parameters. It also provides a QCD basis for constituent quark
models, extending their applicability above the scale of chiral symmetry
breaking.

matter fields, present in any arbitrary interacting gauge theory, has been a
long-standing problem. In our present investigation, the local, covariant,
continuous and off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the
Dirac fields $(\psi, \bar\psi)$ are derived in the framework of the augmented
superfield formulation where the four $(3 + 1)$-dimensional (4D) interacting
non-Abelian gauge theory is considered on the six $(4 + 2)$-dimensional
supermanifold parametrized by the four even spacetime coordinates $x^\mu$ and a
couple of odd elements ($\theta$ and $\bar\theta$) of the Grassmann algebra.
The requirement of the invariance of the matter (super)currents and the
horizontality condition on the (super)manifolds leads to the derivation of the
nilpotent symmetries for the matter fields as well as the gauge- and the
(anti-)ghost fields of the theory in the general scheme of the augmented
superfield formalism.
