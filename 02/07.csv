North and South is derived from our X-Ray Luminosity Function for Galaxies in
these Deep Fields. Mild evolution is seen up to redshift order unity with SFR ~
(1 + z)^{2.7}. This is the first directly observed normal star-forming galaxy
X-ray luminosity function (XLF) at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z>0).
This provides the most direct measure yet of the X-ray derived cosmic
star-formation history of the Universe. We make use of Bayesian statistical
methods to classify the galaxies and the two types of AGN, finding the most
useful discriminators to be the X-ray luminosity, X-ray hardness ratio, and
X-ray to optical flux ratio. There is some residual AGN contamination in the
sample at the bright end of the luminosity function. Incompleteness slightly
flattens the XLF at the faint end of the luminosity function. The XLF has a
lognormal distribution and agrees well with the radio and infrared luminosity
functions. However, the XLF does not agree with the Schechter luminosity
function for the H-alpha LF indicating that additional and different physical
processes may be involved in the establishment of the lognormal form of the
XLF. The agreement of our star formation history points with the other star
formation determinations in different wavebands (IR, Radio, H-alpha) gives an
interesting constraint on the IMF, and X-rays may be measuring directly the
binary star formation history of the Universe. X-ray studies will continue to
be useful for probing the star formation history of the universe by avoiding
problems of obscuration. Star formation may therefore be measured in more
detail by deep surveys with future x-ray missions.

from ASCA data, T=12.3 (+3.1, -2.2) keV (Donahue et al. 1998), and a little
lower than the Chandra temperature, T=10.4(+1.7, -1.5) keV, determined by

the previously derived temperatures is discussed in detail. If one allows the

we identified systems of galaxies in a wide range of masses. Systems with
masses greater than $ M_{cut}= 4 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot} h^{-1} $ are
considered ""host"", whereas smaller systems are taken as groups. Our results
show that groups properties are affected by the proximity of massive hosts.
Physical properties such as velocity dispersion, internal energy ($E$) and
virial radius, show an increment, whereas the mean density decreases as the
host-group distance is smaller. By analysing groups with different properties,
we find that the low mass and the weakly bounded ($E > 0$) subsamples, are
strongly affected by the presence of the host; on the other hand, massive
groups and groups with $E < 0$ do not show dependence on the host-group
distance. Using a sample of groups identified in the final version of the 2dF
Galaxy Redshift Survey, we find a very similar velocity dispersion behaviour in
the observational data compared to results in the simulation. We also study the
dependence of the groups velocity dispersion on the host masses in both,
observations and simulation; finding that the larger is the host mass the
higher is the effect on its vicinity.

supernova SN 1998bw and its low-energy gamma-ray burst GRB 980425 may be
understood if they originated in a standard gamma-ray burst explosion viewed
far from the axis of the relativistic jet. In this scenario, strong radio
emission is predicted from the jet on a timescale 1 to 10 years after the
explosion as it decelerates and spreads into our line of sight. To test this
hypothesis we have carried out late-time radio observations of SN 1998bw at
$t=5.6$ years, yielding upper limits which are consistent with the continued
fading of the supernova. We find these limits to be consistent with an off-axis
jet only if the progenitor mass loss rate is $\dot{M}\lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ (for a wind velocity $v_w=1000$ km s$^{-1}$) or the
fraction of the shock energy in magnetic fields is $\epsilon_B \lesssim
10^{-3}$. These values are low relative to those inferred for cosmological
GRBs. We combine the SN 1998bw measurements with existing observations for a
sample of 15 local Type Ibc supernovae to estimate that at most 6% produce
collimated, relativistic outflows.

the properties of the broad line region, which regulate the cooling efficiency

is obtained from the temperature dependence of the chemical potentials and,
alternatively, directly by Ewald summation, as well as a reaction field based
method. All three different approaches provide consistent results. The reaction
field method allows a separation of the individual components to the heat
capacity of solvation into solute/solvent and solvent/solvent parts, revealing
the solvent/solvent part as the dominating contribution. A detailed spacial
analysis of the heat capacity of the water molecules around a pair of Xenon
particles at different separations reveals that the enhanced heat capacity of
the water molecules in the bisector plane between two Xenon atoms is
responsible for the maximum of the heat capacity observed at the desolvation
barrier, recently reported by Shimizu and Chan ({\em J. Am. Chem. Soc.},{\bf
123}, 2083--2084 (2001)). The about 60% enlarged heat capacity of water in the
concave part of the joint Xenon-Xenon hydration shell is the result of a
counterplay of strengthened hydrogen bonds and an enhanced breaking of hydrogen
bonds with increasing temperature. Differences between the two models
concerning the heat capacity in the Xenon-Xenon contact state are attributed to
the different water model bulk heat capacities, and to the different spacial
extension of the structure effect introduced by the hydrophobic particles.
Similarities between the different states of water in the joint Xenon-Xenon

materials. Motivated by a need in industry to efficiently handle granular
materials and a desire to make fundamental advances in non-equilibrium physics,
experimental and theoretical investigations have shown size separation to be a
complex phenomena. Large particles in a vibrated granular system invariably
rise to the top. However, they may also sink to the bottom, or show other
patterns depending on subtle variations in physical conditions. While size
ratio is a dominant factor, particle specific properties such as density,
inelasticity and friction can play an important role. The nature of the energy
input, boundary conditions and interstitial air have been also shown to be
significant factors in determining spatial distributions. The presence of
convection can enhance mixing or lead to size separation. Experimental
techniques including direct visualization and magnetic resonance imaging are
being used to investigate these properties. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulation techniques have been developed to probe size separation. Analytical
methods such as kinetic theory are being used to study the interplay between
particle size and density in the vibro-fluidized regime, and geometric models
have been proposed to describe size separation for deep beds. Besides
discussing these studies, we will also review the impact of inelastic collision
and friction on the density and velocity distributions to gain a deeper
appreciation of the non-equilibrium nature of the system. While a substantial
number of studies have been accomplished, considerable work is still required
to achieve a firm description of the phenomena.

central tin-rich core and a coaxial Nb tube, thus causing the tin content and
superconducting properties to vary with radius across the A15 layer. Since this
geometry is also ideal for magnetic characterization of the superconducting
properties with the field parallel to the tube axis, a system of concentric
shells with varying tin content was used to simulate the superconducting
properties, the overall severity of the Sn composition gradient being defined
by an index N. Using well-known scaling relationships and property trends
developed in an earlier experimental study, the critical current density for
each shell was calculated, and from this the magnetic moment of each shell was
found. By summing these moments, experimentally measured properties such as
pinning-force curves and Kramer plots could be simulated. We found that
different tin profiles have only a minor effect on the shape of Kramer plots,
but a pronounced effect on the irreversibility fields defined by the
extrapolation of Kramer plots. In fact, these extrapolated values H_K are very
close to a weighted average of the superconducting properties across the layer
for all N. The difference between H_K and the upper critical field commonly
seen in experiments is a direct consequence of the different ways measurements
probe the simulated Sn gradients. Sn gradients were found to be significantly
deleterious to the critical current density Jc, since reductions to both the
elementary pinning force and the flux pinning scaling field H_K compound the
reduction in Jc. The simulations show that significant gains in Jc of Nb3Sn
strands might be realized by circumventing strong compositional gradients of
tin.

increase the amplitude along the axis away from the trap center. Near the ends,

constraints. Here we construct and analyze random-matrix ensembles arising from
the generalized entropy S_q = (1 - \int d{\bf H} [P({\bf H})]^q)/(q-1) (thus
S_1=S_{BGS}). The resulting ensembles are characterized by a parameter q
measuring the degree of nonextensivity of the entropic form. Making q -> 1
recovers the Gaussian ensembles. If q \ne 1, the joint probability
distributions P(\bf H) cannot be factorized, i.e., the matrix elements of \bf H
are correlated. In the limit of large matrices two different regimes are
observed. When q<1, P(\bf H) has compact support, and the fluctuations tend
asymptotically to those of the Gaussian ensembles. Anomalies appear for q>1:
Both P(\bf H) and the marginal distributions P(H_{ij}) show power-law tails.
Numerical analyses reveal that the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution is
also long-tailed (not Wigner-Dyson) and, after proper scaling, very close to
the result for the 2 x 2 case -- a generalization of Wigner's surmise. We
discuss connections of these ""nonextensive"" ensembles with other non-Gaussian

physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides
strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly
enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum non-demolition
measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for

allow production of microwave photon states of fundamental importance for

according to the rules of the model, the strengths of the predator-prey links
are not determined a priori, and emerge from the process of constructing the
web. We measure the distribution of these link strengths, and find that there
are a large number of weak links, in agreement with recent suggestions. We also

tentative comparisons with our results. The difficulties of making such

decomposition v=k1 a k2 of the unitary group is explicitly computable and

side factors k1 and k2 of this Concurrence Canonical Decomposition (CCD) are
concurrence symmetries, so the dynamics reduce to consideration of the a
factor. In this work, we provide an explicit numerical algorithm computing v=k1
a k2 for n odd. Further, in the odd case we lift the monotone to a two-argument
function, allowing for a theory of concurrence dynamics in odd qubits. The
generalization may also be studied using the CCD, leading again to maximal
concurrence capacity for most unitaries. The key technique is to consider the
spin-flip as a time reversal symmetry operator in Wigner's axiomatization; the
original CCD derivation may be restated entirely in terms of this time
reversal. En route, we observe a Kramers' nondegeneracy: the existence of a
nondegenerate eigenstate of any time reversal symmetric n-qubit Hamiltonian
demands (i) n even and (ii) maximal concurrence of said eigenstate. We provide
examples of how to apply this work to study the kinematics and dynamics of

show that the evaluation of a roof-based mixed-state extension is equivalent to
calculating a hyperplane which is multiply tangent to the variety in a number

measure. In this way we provide an implicit representation of optimal
