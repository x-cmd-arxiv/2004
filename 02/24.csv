Telescope (HST) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence for
cosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration.
These objects, discovered during the course of the GOODS ACS Treasury program,
include 6 of the 7 highest-redshift SNe Ia known, all at z>1.25, and populate
the Hubble diagram in unexplored territory. The luminosity distances to these
and 170 previous SNe Ia are provided. A purely kinematic interpretation of the
SN Ia sample provides evidence at the > 99% confidence level for a transition
from deceleration to acceleration or similarly, strong evidence for a cosmic
jerk. Using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between the
two epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46 +/- 0.13. The data are consistent
with the cosmic concordance model of Omega_M ~ 0.3, Omega_Lambda~0.7
(chi^2_dof=1.06), and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dust
as an alternative to dark energy. For a flat Universe with a cosmological
constant. When combined with external flat-Universe constraints we find w=-1.02
+ 0.13 - 0.19 (and $<-0.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed static
equation of state of dark energy, P = w\rho c^2. Joint constraints on both the
recent equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, and its time evolution, dw/dz,
are a factor of ~8 more precise than its first estimate and twice as precise as
those without the SNe Ia discovered with HST. Our constraints are consistent
with the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant
(i.e., w_0 = -1.0, dw/dz = 0), and are inconsistent with very rapid evolution
of dark energy. We address consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate of
the Universe.

discovery of non-sinusoidal burst oscillation lightcurves from the accreting
millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 has changed this situation. We, therefore, for
the first time, make use of this opportunity to constrain neutron star
parameters. In our detailed study of the lightcurves of 22 bursts, we fit the
burst oscillation lightcurves with fully general relativistic models that
include light-bending and frame-dragging for lightcurve calculation, and
compute numerically the structure of neutron stars using realistic equations of
state. We find that for our model and parameter grid values, at the 90%

find that the photons from the thermonuclear flash come out through the layers
of accreted matter under conditions consistent with Thomson scattering, and
show that the secondary companion is a hydrogen burning main sequence star,
with possible bloating (probably due to X-ray heating).

evolution. We find that when evolved secondaries are included a spread in the
secondary mass-orbital period plane comparable to that seen in the data is
produced for either the saturated prescription for magnetic braking or the
unsaturated model commonly used for CVs. We argue that in order to explain this
spread a considerable fraction of all CVs should have evolved stars as the
secondaries. The evolved stars become fully convective at lower orbital
periods. Therefore, even if there was an abrupt decrease in magnetic braking
for fully convective stars (contrary to open cluster data) it would not be
expected to produce a sharp break in the period distribution for CVs. We also
explore recent proposed revisions to the angular momentum loss rate for single
stars, and find that only modest increases over the saturated prescription are
consistent with the overall observed spindown pattern. We compare predictions
of our models with diagnostics of the mass accretion rate in WDs and find
results intermediate between the saturated and the older braking prescription.
Taken together these suggest that the angular momentum loss rate may be higher
in CV secondaries than in single stars of the same rotation period, but is
still significantly lower than in the traditional model. Alternative
explanations for the CV period gap are discussed.

Accepted by Astrophysical Journal Letters","Astrophys.J. 605 (2004) L45-L48","10.1086/386545",,"astro-ph",,"  The vertical structure of black hole accretion disks in which radiation
dominates the total pressure is investigated using a three-dimensional
radiation-MHD calculation. The domain is a small patch of disk centered 100
Schwarzschild radii from a black hole of 10^8 Solar masses, and the stratified
shearing-box approximation is used. Magneto-rotational instability converts
gravitational energy to turbulent magnetic and kinetic energy. The gas is
heated by magnetic dissipation and by radiation damping of the turbulence, and
cooled by diffusion and advection of radiation through the vertical boundaries.
The resulting structure differs in several fundamental ways from the standard
Shakura-Sunyaev picture. The disk consists of three layers. At the midplane,
the density is large, and the magnetic pressure and total accretion stress are
less than the gas pressure. In lower-density surface layers that are optically
thick, the magnetic pressure and stress are greater than the gas pressure but
less than the radiation pressure. Horizontal density variations in the surface
layers exceed an order of magnitude. Magnetic fields in the regions of greatest
stress are buoyant, and dissipate as they rise, so the heating rate declines
more slowly with height than the stress. Much of the dissipation occurs at low
column depth, and the interior is cooler and less radiation-dominated than in
the Shakura-Sunyaev model with the same surface mass density and flux. The mean
structure is convectively stable.

There is preliminary evidence for a bimodal distribution of flux densities,
which may indicate the existence of two distinct states of accretion onto the
supermassive black hole. At 1.3 and 0.7 cm, there is a tail in the distribution
towards high flux densities. Significant variability is detected at all three
wavelengths, with the largest amplitude variations occurring at 0.7 cm. The rms
deviation of the flux density of Sgr A* is 0.13, 0.16, and 0.21 Jy at 2.0, 1.3,
and 0.7 cm, respectively. During much of this monitoring campaign, Sgr A*
appeared to be relatively quiescent compared to results from previous
campaigns. At no point during the monitoring campaign did the flux density of
Sgr A* more than double its mean value. The mean spectral index of Sgr A* is
alpha=0.20+/-0.01, with a standard deviation of 0.14. The spectral index
appears to depend linearly on the observed flux density at 0.7 cm with a
steeper index observed during outbursts. This correlation is consistent with
the expectation for outbursts that are self-absorbed at wavelengths of 0.7 cm
or longer and inconsistent with the effects of simple models for interstellar
scintillation. Much of the variability of Sgr A*, including possible time lags
between flux density changes at the different wavelengths, appears to occur on
time scales less than the time resolution of our observations (8 days). Future
observations should focus on the evolution of the flux density on these time
scales.

calibrate the models. Isochrones are fitted to the observed color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) of M67 and NGC188, and ages of 3.7 and 6.4 Gyr are respectively
determined. Convective core overshooting is not required to match the turnoff
morphology of either cluster, including the luminosity of the gap in M67,
because central convective cores are larger when diffusive processes are
treated. This is due mainly to the enhanced helium and metal abundances in the
central regions of such models. The observation of solar metallicity open
clusters with ages in the range 4.8--5.7Gyr would further test the calculations
of atomic diffusion in central stellar regions: according to non-diffusive
isochrones, clusters should not have gaps near their main-sequence turnoffs if
they are older than ~4.8Gyr, whereas diffusive isochrones predict that gaps
should persist up to ages of ~5.7Gyr. Surface abundance isochrones are also
calculated. In the case of M67 and NGC188, surface abundance variations are
expected to be small. Abundance differences between stars of very similar Teff
are expected close to the turnoff, especially for elements between P and Ca.
Moreover, in comparison with the results obtained for giants, small generalized
underabundances are expected in main-sequence stars. The lithium to beryllium
ratio is discussed briefly and compared to observations.

magnetic field generated by the rotation of the accretion disk. In this paper,
we consider the wiggled structure of the AGN jets by using the result of a
3-dimensional simulation. Our numerical results show that the distributions of
FRM and the projected magnetic field have a clear correlation with the large
scale structure of the jet itself, namely, 3-dimensional helix. Distributions,
seeing the jet from a certain direction, show a good matching with those in a
part of 3C449 jet. This suggests that the jet has a helical structure and that
the magnetic field (especially the toroidal component) plays an important role
in the dynamics of the wiggle formation because it is due to a current-driven
helical kink instability in our model.

thirteen 1.2mm sources associated with optical/near-infrared objects in the

redshift of the radio-identified mm sources is ~2.6 from the radio/mm
estimator, and the median optical/near-infrared photometric redshifts for the
objects with counterparts ~2.1. This suggests that those radio-identified mm
sources without optical/near-infrared counterparts tend to lie at higher
redshifts than those with optical/near-infrared counterparts. Compared to
published identifications of objects from 850micron surveys of similar depth,
the median K and I magnitudes of our counterparts are roughly two magnitudes
fainter and the dispersion of I-K colors is less. Real differences in the
median redshifts, residual mis-identifications with bright objects, cosmic
variance, and small number statistics are likely to contribute to this
significant difference, which also affects redshift measurement strategies. We
discuss basic properties of the near-infrared/(sub)mm/radio spectral energy
distributions of our galaxies and of interferometrically identified submm
sources from the literature. From a comparison with submm objects with
CO-confirmed spectroscopic redshifts we argue that roughly two thirds of the

the presence of a radial shock in the accretion disk, as in some of the Two
Component Advective Flow (TCAF) solutions. We discuss the behaviour of the flux
tubes inside a TCAF (which we name Magnetized TCAF or MTCAF model for brevity)
and compare various competing forces on the flux tubes. In this MTCAF model, we
find that the magnetic tension is the strongest force in a hot plasma of
temperature $\gsim 10^{10}$K and as a result, magnetic flux tubes entering in
this region collapse catastrophically, thereby occasionally evacuating the
inner disk. We postulate that this magnetic `rubber-band' effect induced
evacuated disk matter produces the blobby components of outflows and IR/radio
jets. We derive the size of the post-shock region by equating the time scale of
the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations to the infall time of accreting matter in the
post-shock region and found the shock location to be $\sim 45-66 r_g$. We
calculate the transition radius $r_{tr}$, where the Keplerian disk deviates
into a sub-Keplerian flow, to be $\sim 320r_g$. Based on the derived X-ray
spectral parameters, we calculate the mass of this region to be $\sim10^{18}$g.
We conclude that during the X-ray dips the matter in the post-shock region,
which manifests itself as the thermal-Compton component in the X-ray spectrum,
is ejected, along with some sub-Keplerian matter in the pre-shock region.

temperature of the hot electrons is decided by the degree of inverse
Comptonization of the soft photons. If we consider only thermally-driven flows
from the centrifugal pressure-supported boundary layer around a black hole, we
find that when the thermal electrons are cooled down, either because of the
absence of the boundary layer (low compression ratio), or when the surface of
the boundary layer is formed very far away, the outflow rate is negligible. For
an intermediate size of this boundary layer the outflow rate is maximal. Since

probe the chemical status of molecular gas in the CND of NGC1068, a
prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy. Precedent claims that the chemistry of molecular
gas in the nucleus of NGC1068 is abnormal by galactic standards were based on
the high HCN/CO luminosity ratio measured in the CND. Results from new
observations obtained in this survey have served to derive abundances of
molecular species such as SiO, CN, HCO+, HOC+, H13CO+ and HCO. These estimates
are complemented by a re-evaluation of molecular abundances for HCN, CS and CO,
based on previously published single-dish and interferometer observations of
NGC1068. We report on the first detection of SiO emission in the CND of
NGC1068. The estimated large abundance of SiO in the CND, X(SiO)~5-10x10^{-9},
cannot be attributed to shocks related to star formation, as there is little
evidence of a recent starburst in the nucleus of NGC1068. Alternatively, we
propose that silicon chemistry is driven by intense X-ray processing of
molecular gas. We also report on the first extragalactic detection of the
reactive ion HOC+. Most remarkably, the estimated HCO+/HOC+ abundance ratio in
the nucleus of NGC1068, ~30-80, is the smallest ever measured in molecular gas.
The abundances derived for all molecules that have been the subject of this
survey are compared with the predictions of models invoking either
oxygen-depletion or X-ray chemistry in molecular gas. Our conclusions favour an
overall scenario where the CND of NGC1068 has become a giant X-ray Dominated

providing ~ 10 suitable target stars per year that undergo microlensing events
involving passages over the caustic created by a binary lens which last from a
few hours to a few days and allow to resolve the stellar atmosphere by frequent
broadband photometry. For a caustic exit lasting 12 h and a photometric
precision of 1.5%, a moderate sampling interval of 30 min (corresponding to ~

reduces to ~ 3% for a reduced sampling interval of 6 min for the surroundings

limb-darkening coefficients for several filters can be obtained or observing
time can be spent on other targets during the same night. The adoption of an
inappropriate stellar intensity profile yields characteristic systematics in
the model residuals which can be distinguished from those arising from effects
causing an acceleration between source and caustic which are however unlikely
to affect the lightcurve significantly for most events, although a free

be the first confirmed superoutbursting intermediate polar IP). The spin
profile is double-peaked with a peak separation of about 1/3 spin phases. This
appears to be a typical feature for IPs with a small magnetic field and fast
white dwarf rotation. An alternative explanation is that the 414 sec signal is
a Quasi-periodic Oscillation (QPO) that is caused by mass transfer variation
from the secondary, a bright region (``blob'') rotating in the disc at a radius
of approximately ~9 Rwd or - more likely - a travelling wave close to the inner
disc edge of a dwarf nova with a low field white dwarf. The XMM-Newton RGS
spectra reveal double peaked emission for the O VIII Ly alpha line. Scenarios
in the IP and dwarf nova model are discussed (an emitting ring in the disc,
bright X-ray spot on disc edge, or emitting accretion funnels), but the
intermediate polar model is favoured. Supported is this idea by the finding
that only the red peak appears to be shifted and the `blue' peak is compatible
with the rest wavelength. The red peak thus is caused by emission from the
northern accretion spot when it faces the observer. Instead, the peak at the
rest wavelength is caused when the southern accretion funnel is visible just on
the lower edge of the white dwarf - with the velocity of the accreting material
being perpendicular to the line of sight.

mock data show that the shape of the recovered luminosity function is expected
to differ from the true shape, and this must be allowed for when interpreting
the data. The variation of halo mass-to-light ratio with group size is studied
in both these wavebands. A robust trend of increasing M/L with increasing group
luminosity is found in the 2PIGG data. From groups with L_bj=10^{10}Lsol to
those 100 times more luminous, the typical bj-band M/L increases by a factor of
5, whereas the rf-band M/L grows by a factor of 3.5. These trends agree well

2-10 keV emission is mainly due to HMXBs - allows us to properly calibrate the
SFR-L_{2-10}^{HMXB} relation. The SFR-L_{2-10}^{HMXB} relation holds also for
distant (z ~ 1) galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field North sample, for which we
lack spectral information, but whose SFR can be estimated from deep radio data.
If confirmed by more detailed observations, it may be possible to use the
deduced relation to identify distant galaxies that are X-ray overluminous for
their (independently estimated) SFR, and are therefore likely to hide strongly
absorbed AGNs.

s becomes only relevant at small r_s (large densities) where one has a quantum

a role at large r_s (small densities) where one has a Wigner solid, the lattice
limiting its harmonic vibrations. The thermodynamic limit of physical systems
of different a_B* is qualitatively discussed, before quantitatively studying
the lattice effects occurring at large r_s. Using a few particle system, we
compare exact numerical results obtained with a lattice and analytical
perturbative expansions obtained in the continuum limit. Three criteria giving
similar values for the lattice threshold $r_s^*$ are proposed. The first one is
a delocalization criterion in the Fock basis of lattice site orbitals. The
second one uses the persistent current which can depend on the interaction in a
lattice, while it becomes independent of the interaction in the continuum

result that the saturation intensity substantially decreases with narrowing of

intensities by making use of calculated (linear) absorption coefficients for

negative cosmological constant by matching an interior spacetime to the
exterior anti-de Sitter vacuum solution. The spatial topology of this plane
symmetric wormhole can be planar, cylindrical and toroidal. As usual the null
energy condition is necessarily violated at the throat. At the junction
surface, the surface stresses are determined. By expressing the tangential
surface pressure as a function of several parameters, namely, that of the
matching radius, the radial derivative of the redshift function and of the
surface energy density, the sign of the tangential surface pressure is
analyzed. We then study four specific equations of state at the junction: zero
surface energy density, constant redshift function, domain wall equation of
state, and traceless surface stress-energy tensor. The equation governing the
behavior of the radial pressure, in terms of the surface stresses and the
extrinsic curvatures, is also displayed. Finally, we construct a model of a
plane symmetric traversable wormhole which minimizes the usage of the exotic
matter at the throat, i.e., the null energy condition is made arbitrarily small
at the wormhole throat, while the surface stresses on the junction surface
satisfy the weak energy condition, and consequently the null energy condition.
The construction of these wormholes does not alter the topology of the
background spacetime (i.e., spacetime is not multiply-connected), so that these
solutions can instead be considered domain walls. Thus, in general, these
wormhole solutions do not allow time travel.

history and present status of finite-temperature perturbation theory as applied
to the context of determining the equilibrium properties of quark-gluon plasma,
most notably the pressure of QCD at finite temperatures and quark chemical
potentials. We first introduce the general formalism of finite-temperature
field theory and perturbation theory, then follow through the evaluation of the
pressure order by order, and finally proceed to analyze the most recent, order
g^6ln(g) results by comparing the perturbative predictions with lattice data.
In the appendix we provide a somewhat pedagogical introduction to the most
important computational techniques used in the perturbative framework, namely
the analytic evaluation of multi-loop vacuum diagrams both in full QCD and in
its three-dimensional high-T effective theories.

particles are evaluated in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics. The Wigner
hyper-planes (intrinsic rest frame of the isolated system) turn out to be the
natural framework for describing multipole kinematics. Classical concepts like
the {\it barycentric tensor of inertia} turn out to be extensible to special
relativity only by means of the quadrupole moments of the isolated system. Two
new applications of the multipole technique are worked out for systems of
interacting particles and fields. In the rest-frame of the isolated system of
either free or interacting positive energy particles it is possible to define a
unique world-line which embodies the properties of the most relevant centroids
introduced in the literature as candidates for the collective motion of the
system. This is no longer true, however, in the case of open subsystems of the
isolated system. While effective mass, 3-momentum and angular momentum in the
rest frame can be calculated from the definition of the {\it subsystem
energy-momentum tensor}, the definitions of effective center of motion and
effective intrinsic spin of the subsystem are not unique. Actually, each of the
previously considered centroids corresponds to a different world-line in the
case of open systems. The pole-dipole description of open subsystems is
compared to their description as effective extended objects. Hopefully, the
technique developed here could be instrumental for the relativistic treatment
of binary star systems in metric gravity.

in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. However, AdS spacetime fails to be globally
hyperbolic, so a classical field satisfying a hyperbolic wave equation on AdS
spacetime need not have a well defined dynamics. Nevertheless, AdS spacetime is
static, so the possible rules of dynamics for a field satisfying a linear wave
equation are constrained by our previous general analysis--given in paper
II--where it was shown that the possible choices of dynamics correspond to
choices of positive, self-adjoint extensions of a certain differential
operator, $A$. In the present paper, we reduce the analysis of electromagnetic,
and gravitational perturbations in AdS spacetime to scalar wave equations. We
then apply our general results to analyse the possible dynamics of scalar,
electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in AdS spacetime. In AdS
spacetime, the freedom (if any) in choosing self-adjoint extensions of $A$
corresponds to the freedom (if any) in choosing suitable boundary conditions at
infinity, so our analysis determines all of the possible boundary conditions
that can be imposed at infinity. In particular, we show that other boundary
conditions besides the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions may be possible,
depending on the value of the effective mass for scalar field perturbations,
and depending on the number of spacetime dimensions and type of mode for
electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.

  We show that for (u,v) moving along any southeast-directed curve in the
quadrant, these Young diagrams form a Markov chain with continuous time. We
also describe these chains in terms of jump rates.
  Our main result is the computation of the dynamical correlation functions of
such Markov chains and their bulk and edge scaling limits.

$^{53}$Mn, $^{54}$Fe, $^{55}$Co and $^{56,57,58,59}$Ni, suggesting the
existence of significant core-excitations in low-lying non-yrast states as well
as in high-spin yrast states. The results of $N=Z$ odd-odd nuclei, $^{54}$Co
and $^{58}$Cu, also confirm the reliability of GXPF1 interaction in the isospin

Monte Carlo Shell Model over conventional calculations in cases where
full-space calculations still remain too large to be practical.

first excited levels of the $^{14}$C and $^{14}$N nuclei are presented.
  The effects of nuclear fragmentation have been obtained in a self-consistent
approach and are accounted for in the determination of the two-nucleon removal
amplitudes.
  The Hilbert space is partitioned in order to compute the contribution of both
long- and short-range effects in a separate way.
  Both the two-proton and the proton-neutron emission cross sections have been
computed within the same models for the reaction mechanism and the contribution
from nuclear structure, with the aim of better comparing the differences
between the two physical processes.
  The $^{16}$O$(e,e'pp)$ reaction is found to be sensitive to short-range
correlations, in agreement with previous results. The $^{16}$O$(e,e'pn)$ cross
section to $1^+$ final states is dominated by the $\Delta$ current and tensor
correlations. For both reactions, the interplay between collective (long-range)
effects and short-range and tensor correlations plays an important role. This
suggests that the selectivity of $(e,e'pN)$ reactions to the final state can be
used to probe correlations also beyond short-range effects.

Methods for implementing postselected quantum computation with noisy gates are

detecting no errors, it is expected that the encoded computation can be made to
be arbitrarily accurate. Although the probability of success of the encoded
computation decreases dramatically with accuracy, it is possible to apply the

sets under two different assumptions.
  The first assumption means that for tensor product of two channels with
arbitrary constraints there exists optimal ensemble with the product state
average. It turns out that exactly this assumption guarantees hereditary
property of the both optimal sets for tensor product channel and provides some
observations concerning the additivity problems.
