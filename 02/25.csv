interpreted in terms of orientation variations of a helical, inhomogeneous,
non-thermally emitting jet, possibly caused by the orbital motion of the parent
black hole in a binary system (Villata & Raiteri 1999). The helical-jet model
is here applied to explain the quasi-periodic radio-optical light curves and
the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the BL Lac object AO
0235+16. Through a suitable choice of the model parameters, the helix rotation
can well account for the periodicity of the main radio and optical outbursts
and for the corresponding SED variability, while the interspersed minor radio
events could be interpreted as due either to some local distortions of the
helical structure or to other phenomena contributing to the source emission. In
particular, the probable existence of flow instabilities provides a viable
interpretation for the non-periodic features.

jet-driven outflows whereas other are better constrained by wind-driven models.
The data also allow to estimate accretion rates varying from a few times
10^{-5}Msun/yr for the intermediate-mass sources to a few times 10^{-4}Msun/yr
for the high-mass source, consistent with models explaining star formation of

emission into 73 point-sources, of which 37 lie within the D_25 isophote. The
unresolved emission is discussed in two companion papers. The source luminosity
function (XLF) shows the break seen in other early-type galaxies at
\~2x10^{38}ergs/s. After correcting for detection incompleteness due to source
confusion and contamination from diffuse emission, the break vanishes and the
data are well-described as a single power law. This casts further doubt on
there being a ``universal'' XLF break in such galaxies dividing neutron-star
and black-hole systems. The slope of the differential XLF (dN/dL),
beta=2.7+/-0.5, is marginally (~2.5 sigma) steeper than has been found for
analogous fits of other early-type galaxies but resembles what is generally
seen at high luminosities. Two of the sources within D_25 are ULX, although
neither have L_X>2x 10^{39} ergs/s. The absence of very luminous ULX in
early-type galaxies suggests a break in the XLF slope at ~1-2x 10^{39} ergs/s,
but we cannot constrain it in NGC 1332. The sources have a spatial distribution
consistent with the optical light and display a range of properties expected
for a LMXB population. The spectra of the individual sources, as well as the
composite source spectra, agree with observations of other early-type galaxies,
although a small number of highly-absorbed sources are seen. Two sources have
very soft spectra, two show strong variability and one source shows evidence of
an extended radial profile. We do not detect a central source in NGC 1332, but
we find a faint (L_X=2+/-1 x 10^{38} ergs/s) point-source coincident with the
centre of the companion dwarf galaxy NGC 1331. (Abridged)

result in radio signals that can be used to detect or constrain the dark matter
halo density profile or dark matter particle properties. At the Galactic
Center, the accretion flow onto the central Black Hole (BH) sustains strong
magnetic fields that can induce synchrotron emission by electrons and positrons
generated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the BH. Here we
reanalyze the radiative processes relevant for the neutralino annihilation
signal at the GC, with realistic assumptions about the accretion flow and its
magnetic properties. We find that neglecting these effects, as done in previous
papers, leads to the incorrent electron and photon spectra. We find that the
magnetic fields associated with the flow are significantly stronger than
previously estimated. We derive the appropriate equilibrium distribution of
electrons and positron and the resulting radiation, considering adiabatic
compression in the accretion flow, inverse Compton scattering off synchrotron
photons (synchrotron self-Compton scattering), and synchrotron self-absorption
of the emitted radiation. We derive the signal for a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
dark matter halo profile and a NFW profile with a dark matter spike due to the
central BH. We find that the observed radio emission from the GC is
inconsistent with the scenario in which a spiky distribution of neutralinos is
present. We discuss several important differences between our calculations and
those previously presented in the literature.

observed ([Fe/H] = -5.3). Its discovery has an important bearing on the
question of the observability of ""first generation"" stars. In common with other
metal-poor stars (-4 < [Fe/H] < -2.5), HE0107-5240 shows a peculiar abundance
pattern (CNO rich, moderate Na rich). We elaborate the binary scenario on the
basis of the evolution and nucleosynthesis of extremely metal-poor, low-mass
model stars and discuss the possibility of discriminating this scenario from
others. In our picture, iron peak elements arise in surface layers of the
component stars by accretion of gas from the polluted primordial cloud. To
explain the observed C, N, O, and Na enhancements as well as 12C/13C ratio, we
suppose that the currently observed star accreted matter from a AGB companion.
To estimate the abundances in the matter transferred in the binary, we rely on
the results of computations of model stars constructed with up-to-date input
physics. Nucleosynthesis in the helium flash convection with hydrogen injected
is followed, allowing us to discuss the abundances of s-process elements, in
addition to explaining the origin of the observed O and Na enrichments. From
the observed abundances, we conclude that HE0107-5240 has evolved from a wide
binary with a primary of initial mass, 1.2 ~ 3 Msun. We estimated the present
binary separation of ~ 34 AU and period of ~ 150 years. We also conclude that
the abundance distribution of the heavy s-process elements, may hold the key to
understand the origin of HE0107-5240. An enhancement of [Pb/Fe] = 1 ~ 2 should
be observed. If the enhancement of s-process elements is not detected,
HE0107-5240 may be a first generation secondary in a binary system with a
primary of mass less than 2.5 Msun.

problem which makes minimal assumptions about the required filter system. By
considering a filter system as a set of free parameters it may be designed by
optimizing some figure-of-merit (FoM) with respect to these parameters. In the
example considered, the FoM is a measure of how well the filter system can
`separate' stars with different APs. This separation is vectorial in nature, in
the sense that the local directions of AP variance are preferably mutually
orthogonal to avoid AP degeneracy. The optimization is carried out with an
evolutionary algorithm, which uses principles of evolutionary biology to search
the parameter space. This model, HFD (Heuristic Filter Design), is applied to
the design of photometric systems for the Gaia space astrometry mission. The
optimized systems show a number of interesting features, not least the
persistence of broad, overlapping filters. These HFD systems perform as least
as well as other proposed systems for Gaia, although inadequacies remain in
all. The principles underlying HFD are quite generic and may be applied to
filter design for numerous other projects, such as the search for specific
types of objects or photometric redshift determination.

obtain relative frequencies (F_{BSS}) and specific densities (N_S) using
different stellar populations extracted from the CMD. The cluster F_{BSS} is
significantly smaller than the relative frequency of field BSS. We find a
significant anti-correlation between the BSS relative frequency in a cluster
and its total absolute luminosity (mass). There is no statistically significant
trend between the BSS frequency and the expected collision rate. F_{BSS} does
not depend on other cluster parameters, apart from a mild dependence on the
central density. PCC clusters act like normal clusters as far as the BSS
frequency is concerned. We also show that the BSS luminosity function for the
most luminous clusters is significantly different, with a brighter peak and
extending to brighter luminosities than in the less luminous clusters. These
results imply that the efficiency of BSS production mechanisms and their
relative importance vary with the cluster mass.

and gravitational instabilities. We investigate this problem with three
dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, taking into account cooling and heating
processes and the action of the self-gravity of the gas. We construct an
algorithm for radiative transfer to post-process the simulated data and build
emission maps in the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line. With this approach, we are
able to reproduce the structure of the shells and holes as observed in regions
of the ISM, where no stellar activity is detected. In order to quantify the
comparison of our synthetic maps to the observations, we calculate the physical
scale-autocorrelation length relation (L-L_{cr} relation) both on the synthetic
HI maps and the HI map of Ho II. The L-L_{cr} relation shows a linear increase
of the autocorrelation length with the physical scale up to the scale of energy
injection and flattens for larger scales. The comparison of the L-L_{cr}
relation between the observations and the synthetic maps suggests that
turbulence is driven in the ISM of Ho II on large scales (~ 6 kpc). The slope
of the L-L_{cr} relation in the linear regime in Ho II is better reproduced by
models where turbulence is coupled with a weak efficiency cooling of the gas.
These results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between turbulence
and the thermodynamics of the gas for structure formation in the ISM. Our
analysis can be used to determine the scale on which kinetic energy is injected
in the ISM of dwarf irregular galaxies, and to derive, in a first
approximation, the cooling rate of the gas.

continuously varies from the periphery to the center depending on the size
ratio between particles [Thomas, Phys. Rev. E 62, 1 (2000) 961-974]. For small
size ratios (typically15): large beads are close to the bottom in a reversing
position. The existence of circles with an intermediate radius shows that the
segregation at an intermediate level within a flow is possible. In this paper,
we experimentally study the segregation of particles of different densities and
sizes in a half-filled rotating drum and other devices (chute flow, pile). In
the drum, the location of the segregated ring continuously varies from the
periphery to the center and is very sensitive to both the size (from 1 to 33)
and density (from 0.36 to 4.8) ratios. The densest large beads segregate on a
circle close to the center, the lightest large beads on a circle close to the
periphery. Consequently, we found that for any tracer, its excess of mass, due
to only a size excess, a density excess, or both, leads to a deep inside
segregation of the tracer. There is a push-away process that makes heavy beads
of any type go downwards, while the excess of size is already known to push
large beads towards the surface, by a dynamical sieving process. Each
segregation at an intermediate ring corresponds to a balance between these mass
and geometrical effects. The segregation level in the flow is determined by the
ratio of the intensities of both effects.

three-dimensional Ising model. This paradigmatic model in its pure version
displays a second-order phase transition with a positive specific heat critical
exponent $\alpha$. According to the Harris criterion disorder should hence lead
to a new fixed point characterized by new critical exponents. We have
determined the phase diagram of the diluted model, between the pure model limit
and the percolation threshold. For the estimation of critical exponents, we
have first performed a finite-size scaling study, where we concentrated on
three different dilutions. We emphasize in this work the great influence of the
cross-over phenomena between the pure, disorder and percolation fixed points
which lead to effective critical exponents dependent on the concentration. In a
second set of simulations, the temperature behaviour of physical quantities has
been studied in order to characterize the disorder fixed point more accurately.
In particular this allowed us to estimate ratios of some critical amplitudes.
In accord with previous observations for other models this provides stronger
evidence for the existence of the disorder fixed point since the amplitude
ratios are more sensitive to the universality class than the critical
exponents. Moreover, the question of non-self-averaging at the disorder fixed
point is investigated and compared with recent results for the bond-diluted
$q=4$ Potts model. Overall our numerical results provide evidence that, as
expected on theoretical grounds, the critical behaviour of the bond-diluted
model is governed by the same universality class as the site-diluted model.

temperature, thickness and external electric field dependence and hysteresis
loops as well as average dielectric susceptibility dependence on temperature
and film thickness have been performed allowing for mismatch-induced

It has been shown that this field influences drastically all the properties

polarization temperature dependence resembles the one in the external electric
field, and there is possibility of external field screening by the internal
one. The obtained asymmetry of hysteresis loop makes it possible to suppose

statics of the model via various structure factors, involving not only the
monomers, but also the center of mass (CM). We find that the conformation of
the chains and the CM-CM structure factor, which is well described by a
recently proposed approximation [Krakoviack et al., Europhys. Lett. 58, 53
(2002)], remain essentially unchanged on cooling toward the critical glass
transition temperature of mode-coupling theory. Spatial correlations between
monomers on different chains, however, depend on temperature, albeit smoothly.
This implies that the glassy behavior of our model cannot result from static
intra-chain or CM-CM correlations. It must be related to inter-chain
correlations at the monomer level. Additionally, we study the dependence of
inter-chain correlation functions on the position of the monomer along the
chain backbone. We find that this site-dependence can be well accounted for by
a theory based on the polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM). We also
analyze triple correlations by means of the three-monomer structure factors for
the melt and for the chains. These structure factors are compared with the
convolution approximation that factorizes them into a product of two-monomer
structure factors. For the chains this factorization works very well,
indicating that chain connectivity does not introduce special triple
correlations in our model. For the melt deviations are more pronounced,
particularly at wave vectors close to the maximum of the static structure

in the space-like axial gauge Schwinger model. In all the calculations we fix
the gauge using a rule, $n{\cdot}A=0$, where $n$ is a space-like constant
vector and we refer to its direction as $x_-$. Then, to begin with, we
construct a formulation in which the quantization surface is space-like but not
parallel to the direction of $n$. The quantization surface has a parameter
which allows us to rotate it, but when we do so we keep the direction of the
gauge field fixed. In that formulation we can use canonical methods. We
bosonize the model to simplify the investigation. We find that the
antiderivative, $({\partial}_-)^{-1}$, is ill-defined whatever quantization
coordinates we use as long as the direction of $n$ is space-like. We find that
the physical part of the dipole ghost field includes infrared divergences.
However, we also find that if we introduce residual gauge fields in such a way
that the dipole ghost field satisfies the canonical commutation relations, then
the residual gauge fields are determined so as to regularize the infrared
divergences contained in the physical part. The propagators then take the form
prescribed by Mandelstam and Leibbrandt. We make use of these properties to
develop guiding principles which allow us to construct consistent operator
solutions in the pure space-like case where the quantization surface is
parallel to the direction of $n$ and canonical methods do not suffice.

The theory is defined on a space-time cylinder with ""twisted"" boundary
conditions, periodic for one colour component (the diagonal 3- component) and
antiperiodic for the other two. The focus of the study is on the non-trivial
vacuum structure and the fermion condensate. It is shown that the
indefinite-metric quantization of free gauge bosons is not compatible with the
residual gauge symmetry of the interacting theory. A suitable quantization of
the unphysical modes of the gauge field is necessary in order to guarantee the
consistency of the subsidiary condition and allow the quantum representation of
the residual gauge symmetry of the classical Lagrangian: the 3-colour component
of the gauge field must be quantized in a space with an indefinite metric while
the other two components require a positive-definite metric. The contribution
of the latter to the free Hamiltonian becomes highly pathological in this
representation, but a larger portion of the interacting Hamiltonian can be
diagonalized, thus allowing perturbative calculations to be performed. The
vacuum is evaluated through second order in perturbation theory and this result
is used for an approximate determination of the fermion condensate.

constant problem within the framework of supersymmetric large extra dimensions
(SLED), as recently proposed in hep-th/0304256. After a brief restatement of
the cosmological constant problem, a short summary of the proposed mechanism is
given. The emphasis is on the perspective of the low-energy effective theory in
order to see how it addresses the problem of why low-energy particles like the
electron do not contribute too large a vacuum energy. This is followed by a
discussion of the main objections, which are grouped into the following five
topics:
  (1) Weinberg's No-Go Theorem.
  (2) Are hidden tunings of the theory required, and a problem?
  (3) Why should the mechanism not rule out earlier epochs of inflation?
  (4) How big are quantum effects, and which are the most dangerous?
  (5) Can the mechanism be consistent with cosmological constraints?
  It is argued that there are plausible reasons why the mechanism can thread
the potential objections, but that a definitive proof that it does depends on
addressing well-defined technical points. These points include identifying what
fixes the size of the extra dimensions, checking how topological obstructions
renormalize and performing specific calculations of quantum corrections. More
detailed studies of these issues, which are well reach within our present
understanding of extra-dimensional theories, are currently underway. As such,
the jury remains out concerning the proposal, although the prospects for
acquittal still seem good.

transformation acting on a space $\Omega$ and $f: \Omega \to \R$. The key

to settle a conjecture of Aubry and Jitomirskaya--Mandel'shtam regarding

  The proof relies on a theorem of Kotani, which shows that non-deterministic

to a chosen metric, which is typically a Sobolev norm on the tangent space of

called ``diffeons,'' whose momenta are supported on embedded subspaces of the
ambient space. Diffeons are true solitons for some choices of the norm. The
diffeon solution ansatz is a momentum map. Consequently. the diffeons evolve
according to canonical Hamiltonian equations. We examine diffeon solutions on
Einstein spaces that are ""mostly"" symmetric, i.e., whose quotient by a subgroup
of the isometry group is 1-dimensional. An example is the two-sphere, whose
isometry group $\SO{3}$ contains $S^1$. In this situation, the singular
diffeons (called ``Puckons'') are supported on latitudes (``girdles'') of the
sphere. For this $S^1$ symmetry of the two-sphere, the canonical Hamiltonian
dynamics for Puckons reduces from integral partial differential equations to a
dynamical system of ordinary differential equations for their colatitudes.
Explicit examples are computed numerically for the motion and interaction of
the Puckons on the sphere with respect to the $H^1$ norm. We analyse this case
and several other 2-dimensional examples. From consideration of these
2-dimensional spaces, we outline the theory for reduction of diffeons on a
general manifold possessing a metric equivalent to the warped product of the
line with the bi-invariant metric of a Lie group.

whether antispirals or spirals will occur in the corresponding

environmental selection pressure. Using a graph theoretical case study, we show
that when efficiency is paramount the ""Star"" topology emerges and when

water permeation if its diameter is less than the diameter of an ion's first
hydration shell. This hydrophobic gating mechanism is thought to operate in a
number of ion channels, e.g. the nicotinic receptor, bacterial mechanosensitive
channels (MscL and MscS) and perhaps in some potassium channels (e.g. KcsA,
MthK, and KvAP). Simplified pore models allow one to investigate the primary
characteristics of a conduction pathway, namely its geometry (shape, pore
length, and radius), the chemical character of the pore wall surface, and its
local flexibility and surface roughness. Our extended (ca. 0.1 \mu s) molecular
dynamic simulations show that a short hydrophobic pore is closed to water for
radii smaller than 0.45 nm. By increasing the polarity of the pore wall (and
thus reducing its hydrophobicity) the transition radius can be decreased until
for hydrophilic pores liquid water is stable down to a radius comparable to a
water molecule's radius. Ions behave similarly but the transition from
conducting to non-conducting pores is even steeper and occurs at a radius of
0.65 nm for hydrophobic pores. The presence of water vapour in a constriction
zone indicates a barrier for ion permeation. A thermodynamic model can explain
the behaviour of water in nanopores in terms of the surface tensions, which
leads to a simple measure of ""hydrophobicity"" in this context. Furthermore,
increased local flexibility decreases the permeability of polar species. An
increase in temperature has the same effect, and we hypothesise that both
effects can be explained by a decrease in the effective solvent-surface
attraction which in turn leads to an increase in the solvent-wall surface free
energy.

propose a way to engineer quantum states using a SQUID charge qubit inside a
microcavity. This device can act as a deterministic single photon source as
well as generate any Fock states and an arbitrary superposition of Fock states
for the cavity field. The controllable interaction between the cavity field and
the qubit can be realized by the tunable gate voltage and classical magnetic
field applied to the SQUID.
