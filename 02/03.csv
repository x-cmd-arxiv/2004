dwarf stars should eventually crystallize. This effect is one of the largest
sources of uncertainty in white dwarf cooling models, which are now routinely
used to estimate the ages of stellar populations in both the Galactic disk and
the halo. We are attempting to minimize this source of uncertainty by
calibrating the models, using observations of pulsating white dwarfs. In a
typical mass white dwarf model, crystallization does not begin until the
surface temperature reaches 6000-8000 K. In more massive white dwarf models the
effect begins at higher surface temperatures, where pulsations are observed in
the ZZ Ceti (DAV) stars. We use the observed pulsation periods of BPM 37093,
the most massive DAV white dwarf presently known, to probe the interior and
determine the size of the crystallized core empirically. Our initial
exploration of the models strongly suggests the presence of a solid core
containing about 90% of the stellar mass, which is consistent with our
theoretical expectations.

using information from galaxies only involves using the full gravitational

gravitational redshift suffer from large galaxy peculiar velocities and
substructure, which act as a source of noise. This and their low number density
make it more reasonable to try averaging over many clusters and groups of

linear momentum, causing center of mass recoil. This ""radiation rocket"" effect

of binary coalescence very accurately; these results can be extrapolated to q ~
0.4 with modest accuracy. Although the recoil from the final plunge contributes
significantly to the final recoil, we are only able to make crude estimates of
its magnitude. We find that the recoil can easily reach ~ 100-200 km/s, but
most likely does not exceed ~ 500 km/s. Though much lower than previous
estimates, this recoil is large enough to have important astrophysical
consequences. These include the ejection of black holes from globular clusters,

Two-dimensional image fitting shows that the E+As are generally bulge-dominated
systems, even though at least two E+As may have underlying disks. In the
Fundamental Plane, E+As stand apart from the E/S0s mainly due to their high
effective surface brightness. Fading of the young stellar population and the
corresponding increase in their effective radii will cause these galaxies to
migrate toward the locus of E/S0s. E+As have profiles qualitatively like those
of normal power-law early-type galaxies, but have higher surface brightnesses.
This result provides the first direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that
power-law ellipticals form via gas-rich mergers. In total, at least four E+As
are morphologically consistent with early-type galaxies. We detect compact
sources, possibly young star clusters, associated with the galaxies. These
sources are much brighter (M_R ~ -13) than Galactic globular clusters, have
luminosities consistent with the brightest clusters in nearby starburst
galaxies, and have blue colors consistent with the ages estimated from the E+A

candidates might provide the elusive chronometer needed to break the

the spectral energy distribution using laboratory measured optical properties

find no satisfactory fit to the 13 micron dust emission feature and the
identification of its carrier is still an open issue. We have also modelled the
molecular absorption bands due to H2O, OH, CO, CO2, SiO, and SO2 and estimated
the excitation temperatures for different bands which range from 300 to 3000K.
It is clear that different molecules giving rise to these absorption bands
originate from different gas layers. We present and analyse high resolution
Fabry-Perot spectra of the three CO2 bands in the 15 micron region. In these
data, the bands are resolved into individual Q-lines in emission, which allows
the direct determination of the excitation temperature and column density of
the emitting gas. This reveals the presence of a warm (about 450K) extended
layer of CO2, somewhere between the photosphere and the dust formation zone.
The gas in this layer is cooler than the 1000K CO2 gas responsible for the
low-resolution absorption bands at 4.25 and 15 micron. The rotational and
vibrational excitation temperatures derived from the individual Q-branch lines
of CO2 are different (450K and 150K, respectively) so that the CO2 level

central dominating galaxy of the cluster. The X-ray surface brightness profile
is well fitted by a modified King beta model, but the cluster is elongated
parallel to the radio source, especially on the scale of the radio lobes. Fits
to individual quadrants give a core radius 50 per cent larger along the radio

emission superimposed on the outer radio lobes. There are no obvious
depressions in the X-ray emission coincident with the radio lobes, as expected
if the relativistic plasma displaces the ICM. However, we show that these

provide a more accurate system clock than the maxima, and thus use these as
indicators of the times of periastron passage. We fit a quadratic ephemeris to
these dips, and find its predictive power for the X-ray lightcurve to be
superior to ephemerides based on the radio flares and the full archival X-ray
lightcurve. Under the hypothesis that the dips are tracers of the mass transfer
rate from the donor, we use their occurrence rate as a function of orbital

the numbers of quasiparticles excited by a photon provide a measure of the

the transport and energy distribution of non-equilibrium quasiparticles excited

full numerical model for the tunneling current of the major physical processes
which determine the signal. We find that a diffusion framework models the

to the lattice temperature during the timescales for tunneling. We extract
physical timescales from the measured data, make comparisons with existing

on small spin polarizations and small momentum transfer scattering, we derive,
starting from the full quantum kinetic equations, a Fokker-Planck equation for
the electron spin polarization. We then construct, using a rigorous multiple
time scale approach, a Bloch equation for the macroscopic ($\vec{k}$-averaged)
spin polarization on the long time scale, where the spin polarization decays.
Spin-conserving energy relaxation and diffusion, which occur on a fast time
scale, after the initial spin polarization has been injected, are incorporated
and shown to give rise to a weight function which defines the energy averages
required for the calculation of the spin relaxation tensor in the Bloch
equation. Our approach provides an intuitive way to conceptualize the dynamics
of the spin polarization in terms of a ``test'' spin polarization which
scatters off ``field'' particles (electrons, impurities, phonons). To
illustrate our approach, we calculate for a quantum well the spin lifetime at
temperatures and densities where electron-electron and electron-impurity
scattering dominate. The spin lifetimes are non-monotonic functions of
temperature and density. Our results show that at electron densities and
temperatures, where the cross-over from the non-degenerate to the degenerate

exponents which vary with the strength of disorder, whereas the dynamical

superfluids/supercondutors in their inner crusts and cores. The implication of
superfluidity/superconductivity for equilibrium and dynamical neutron star
states is that each individual particle species that forms a condensate must
have its own, independent number density current and equation of motion that
determines that current. An important consequence of the quasiparticle nature
of each condensate is the so-called entrainment effect, i.e. the momentum of a
condensate is a linear combination of its own current and those of the other
condensates. We present here the first fully relativistic modelling of slowly
rotating superfluid neutron stars with entrainment that is accurate to the
second-order in the rotation rates. The stars consist of superfluid neutrons,
superconducting protons, and a highly degenerate, relativistic gas of
electrons. We use a relativistic $\sigma$ - $\omega$ mean field model for the
equation of state of the matter and the entrainment. We determine the effect of
a relative rotation between the neutrons and protons on a star's total mass,
shape, and Kepler, mass-shedding limit.

prime goal of both nuclear and particle physics for more than thirty years and
has led to much of the progress in strong interaction physics. Still the flavor
dependence of the nucleon's spin is a significant fundamental question that is
not understood. Experiments measuring the spin content of the nucleon have
reported conflicting results on the amount of nucleon spin carried by strange
quarks. Quasi-elastic neutrino scattering, observed using a novel detection
technique, provides a theoretically clean measure of this quantity.
  The optimum neutrino beam energy needed to measure the strange spin of the
nucleon is 1 GeV. This is also an ideal energy to search for neutrino
oscillations at high $\Delta m^2$ in an astrophysically interesting region.
Models of the r-process in supernovae which include high-mass sterile neutrinos
may explain the abundance of neutron-rich heavy metals in the universe. These
high-mass sterile neutrinos are outside the sensitivity region of any previous
neutrino oscillation experiments.
  The Booster neutrino beamline at Fermilab provides the world's highest
intensity neutrino beam in the 0.5-1.0 GeV energy range, a range ideal for both
of these measurements. A small detector located upstream of the MiniBooNE
detector, 100 m from the recently commissioned Booster neutrino source, could
definitively measure the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin. This
detector, in conjunction with the MiniBooNE detector, could also investigate
$\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance in a currently unexplored, cosmologically interesting
region.

light on decomposition possibilities for wavelet packets used in pyramid

a variety of modern wavelet constructions, and in particular in the selection

a selection of a basis with the best frequency concentration in signal or

the subalgebra is some C(X) for a Gelfand space X. A given representation of A,

each vector in H induces a scalar-valued measure on X. We prove a structure

lattice animals and their surface-area-to-volume ratio. For $\beta \in
[0,2(d-1))$, let $f(\beta)$ be the asymptotic exponential rate in the number of
edges of the number of lattice animals containing the origin which have
surface-area-to-volume ratio $\beta$. The function $f$ is bounded above by a
function which may be written in an explicit form. For low values of $\beta$
($\beta \leq 1/p_c - 1$), equality holds, as originally demonstrated by
F.Delyon. For higher values ($\beta > 1/p_c - 1$), the inequality is strict.
  We introduce two critical exponents, one of which describes how quickly $f$
falls away from the explicit form as $\beta$ rises from $1/p_c - 1$, and the
second of which describes how large clusters appear in the marginally
subcritical regime of the percolation model. We demonstrate that the pair of
exponents must satisfy certain inequalities, while other such inequalities
yield sufficient conditions for the absence of an infinite cluster at the
critical value. The first exponent is related to one of a more conventional
nature in the scaling theory of percolation, that of correlation size. In
deriving this relation, we find that there are two possible behaviours,
depending on the value of the first exponent, for the typical
surface-area-to-volume ratio of an unusually large cluster in the marginally
subcritical regime.

canonical connections of type $(0,1)$ over the bundles of $(p,0)$-forms. If the
almost complex structure is integrable then the previous connections induce the
canonical holomorphic structures of the bundles of $(p,0)$-forms. For $p=1$ we
can extend the corresponding connection to all Schur powers of the bundle of
$(1,0)$-forms. Moreover using the canonical $\C$-linear isomorphism betwen the
bundle of $(1,0)$-forms and the complex cotangent bundle $T^*_{X,J}$ we deduce
canonical connections of type $(0,1)$ over the Schur powers of the complex
cotangent bundle $T^*_{X,J}$. If the almost complex structure is integrable
then the previous $(0,1)$-connections induces the canonical holomorphic
structures of those bundles. In the non integrable case those
$(0,1)$-connections induces just the holomorphic canonical structures of the
restrictions of the corresponding bundles to the images of smooth
$J$-holomorphic curves. We introduce the notion of Chern curvature for those
bundles. The geometrical meaning of this notion is a natural generalisation of
the classical notion of Chern curvature for the holomophic vector bundles over
a complex manifold. We have a particular interest for the case of the tangent
bundle in view of applications concerning the regularisation of
$J$-plurisubharmonic fonctions by means of the geodesic flow induced by a Chern
connection on the tangent bundle. This method has been used by Demailly in the
complex integrable case. Our specific study in the case of the tangent bundle
gives an asymptotic expanson of the Chern flow which relates in a optimal way
the geometric obstructions caused by the torsion of the almost complex
structure, and the non symplectic nature of the metric.

plurisubharmonic on $X$ if it is upper semi-continuous and its restriction to
every local pseudo-holomorphic curve is subharmonic. As in the complex case, it
is conjectured that plurisubharmonicity is equivalent to the fact that the
$(1,1)$-current $i\partial_{_J}\bar{\partial}_{_J}u$ is positive, (the
$(1,1)$-current $i\partial_{_J}\bar{\partial}_{_J}u$ need not be closed here).
The conjecture is trivial if $u$ is of class ${\cal C}^2$. The result is
elementary in the complex integrable case because the operator
$i\partial_{_J}\bar{\partial}_{_J}$ can be written as an operator with constant
coefficients in complex coordinates. Hence the positivity of the current is
preserved by regularising with usual convolution kernels. This is not possible
in the almost complex non integrable case and the proof of the result requires
a much more intrinsic study. In this chapter we prove the necessity of the
positivity of the $(1,1)$-current $i\partial_{_J}\bar{\partial}_{_J}u$. We
prove also the sufficiency of the positivity in the particular case of an upper
semi-continuous function $f$ which is continuous in the complement of the
singular locus $f^{-1}(-\infty)$. For the proof of the sufficiency of the
positivity in the general case of a real distribution $u$, we suggest a method
depending on a rather delicate regularisation argument introduced by Demailly.
This method consists of regularing the function $u$ by means of the flow
induced by a Chern connection on the tangent bundle of the almost complex
manifold.

expectation values tend to a universal limit. This can be viewed as an analogue
of mixing in the classical system. If the classical system is integrable, then
the expectation values need not converge, and if they converge their limit
depends on the initial state. An additional difference occurs in the timescales
for which we can prove this behaviour, in the chaotic case we get up to
Ehrenfest time, $t\sim \ln(1/\hbar)$, whereas for integrable system we have a
much larger time range.

current experimental efforts to extract from the observed solar neutrino
spectrum information on non-standard physics in the neutrino sector. $Hep$
produces highest-energy solar neutrinos, although their flux is quite modest.
This implies that the $Hep$ neutrios can at some level influence the solar
neutrino spectrum near its upper end. Therefore, a precise interpretation of
the observed solar neutrino spectrum requires an accurate estimate of the $Hep$
rate. This is an interesting but challenging task. We describe the difficulties
involved and how the recent theoretical developments in nuclear physics have
enabled us to largely overcome these difficulties. A historical survey of $Hep$
calculations is followed by an overview of the latest developments. We compare
the results obtained in the conventional nuclear physics approach and those
obtained in a newly developed effective field theory approach. We also discuss
the current status of the experiments relevant to $Hep$.

many cellular functions such as transcription, replication, and recombination.
In the process of recognition, a protein rapidly searches for its specific site
on a long DNA molecule and then strongly binds this site. Here we aim to find a
mechanism that can provide both a fast search (1-10 sec) and high stability of
the specific protein-DNA complex ($K_d=10^{-15}-10^{-8}$ M).
  Earlier studies have suggested that rapid search involves the sliding of a
protein along the DNA. Here we consider sliding as a one-dimensional (1D)
diffusion in a sequence-dependent rough energy landscape. We demonstrate that,
in spite of the landscape's roughness, rapid search can be achieved if 1D
sliding is accompanied by 3D diffusion. We estimate the range of the specific
and non-specific DNA-binding energy required for rapid search and suggest
experiments that can test our mechanism. We show that optimal search requires a
protein to spend half of time sliding along the DNA and half diffusing in 3D.
We also establish that, paradoxically, realistic energy functions cannot
provide both rapid search and strong binding of a rigid protein. To reconcile
these two fundamental requirements we propose a search-and-fold mechanism that
involves the coupling of protein binding and partial protein folding.
  Proposed mechanism has several important biological implications for search
in the presence of other proteins and nucleosomes, simultaneous search by
several proteins etc. Proposed mechanism also provides a new framework for
interpretation of experimental and structural data on protein-DNA interactions.

first explain the motivations for considering supplementary parameters

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Gedankenexperiment . Introducing a reasonable
Locality Condition, we will then derive Bell's theorem, which states: (i) that
Local Supplementary Parameters Theories are constrained by Bell's Inequalities;
(ii) that certain predictions of Quantum Mechanics violate Bell's Inequalities,
and therefore that Quantum Mechanics is incompatible with Local Supplementary
Parameters Theories. I then point out that a fundamental assumption for this
conflict is the Locality assumption, and I show that in a more sophisticated
version of the E.P.R. thought experiment (""timing experiment""), the Locality
Condition may be considered a consequence of Einstein's Causality, preventing
faster-than-light interactions. The purpose of this first part is to convince
the reader that the formalism leading to Bell's Inequalities is very general
and reasonable. What is surprising is that such a reasonable formalism
conflicts with Quantum Mechanics. In fact, situations exhibiting a conflict are
very rare, and Quantum Optics is the domain where the most significant tests of
this conflict have been carried out, as presented in sections 7 to 11.

cavity interacting with a nonlinear medium (Kerr nonlinearity) is analyzed. The
qubits are assumed to be initially in the maximally entangled states (Bell or
Bell-like states) or the maximally entangled mixed states, on the example of
Werner and Werner-like states. Two kinds of measures of the entanglement are
considered: the concurrence to describe a decay of the entanglement of
formation of the qubits, and the negativity to determine a decay of the
entanglement cost under positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations. It is
observed that the Kerr nonlinearity, in the discussed decoherence model, does
not affect the entanglement of the qubits initially in the Bell or Werner
states, although the evolution of the qubits can depend on this nonlinearity
explicitly. However, it is shown that for the initial Bell-like state and the
corresponding Werner-like state, the loss of the entanglement can be
periodically reduced by inserting the Kerr nonlinearity in the lossy cavity.
Moreover, the relativity of the entanglement measures is demonstrated, to our
knowledge for the first time, as a result of a physical process.

Gen. 37 (2004) 10139","10.1088/0305-4470/37/43/009",,"quant-ph",,"  The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and the time evolution of a
quantum theory. It is an axiom of quantum mechanics that H be Hermitian because
Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that the time
evolution is unitary (probability preserving). This paper investigates an
alternative way to construct quantum theories in which the conventional
requirement of Hermiticity (combined transpose and complex conjugate) is
replaced by the more physically transparent condition of space-time reflection
(PT) symmetry. It is shown that if the PT symmetry of a Hamiltonian H is not
broken, then the spectrum of H is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian
quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p^2+ix^3 and H=p^2-x^4. The crucial
question is whether PT-symmetric Hamiltonians specify physically acceptable
quantum theories in which the norms of states are positive and the time
evolution is unitary. The answer is that a Hamiltonian that has an unbroken PT
symmetry also possesses a physical symmetry represented by a linear operator
called C. Using C it is shown how to construct an inner product whose
associated norm is positive definite. The result is a new class of fully
consistent complex quantum theories. Observables are defined, probabilities are
positive, and the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. After a
review of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, new results are presented here in
which the C operator is calculated perturbatively in quantum mechanical
theories having several degrees of freedom.
