large-scale magnetic fields in our Galaxy and discuss their limitations. The
magnetic fields in the Galactic halo, mainly revealed by the sky distribution
of rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources, probably have a global
structure of a twisted dipole field. The large-scale field structure in the
Galactic disk has been most efficiently deduced from pulsar rotation measures
(RMs). There has been a lot of progress since the 1980s when the magnetic field
in the local area of our Galaxy was first traced by a very small sample of
local pulsars. Now we have pulsars distributed in about one third of the whole
Galactic disk of the interstellar medium, which shows that the large-scale
magnetic fields go along the spiral arms and that the field directions reverse
from arm to arm. The RMs of newly discovered pulsars in the very inner Galaxy
have been used to show the coherent magnetic field in the Norma arm. The
magnetic fields in the Galactic disk most probably have a bisymmetric spiral
structure.

These findings increase the number of L-dwarfs known within ~10 pc by ~25%. The
remainder of the objects discussed here are early L or very late M-type dwarfs
lying between ~45 and 15 pc and are also new to the literature. Spectral types
have been derived by direct comparison with J-,H- and K- band spectra of known
template ultracool dwarfs given by Leggett et al.
(ftp://ftp.jach.hawaii.edu/pub/ukirt/skl/dL.spectra/) For the known objects, we
generally find agreement to within ~1 subclass with previously derived spectral
types. Distances are determined from the most recent M_J vs. spectral type
calibrations, and together with our derived proper motions yield kinematics for
most targets consistent with that expected for the disk population; for three
probable late M-dwarfs, membership of a dynamically older population is
postulated. The very nearby L-type objects discussed here are of great interest
for future studies of binarity and parallaxes.

Plane Survey (CGPS) region and the North Galactic Pole (NGP) to extract the

into three longitude intervals: $82^\circ<l<96^\circ$ (CGPS1),
$115^\circ<l<130^\circ$ (CGPS2) and $130^\circ<l<146^\circ$ (CGPS3). The
structure functions of all three regions have large uncertainties when the
angular separation is smaller than $\delta\theta\approx 1^\circ$. A power law
can fit the structure function well for $\delta\theta>1^\circ$. The power law
indices get smaller from CGPS1 to CGPS3 and the amplitudes decrease. The
variations of the large-scale field and the electron density have only
negligible effects on the structure function and thus cannot account for the
changes, indicating that the turbulent properties of the Galactic ISM are
intrinsically longitude-dependent. The Kolmogorov-like fluctuation spectrum of
the electron density or the magnetic field should produce a power law structure
function with an index of 5/3 or 2/3, neither of which is consistent with our
results of small indices in the three sub-CGPS regions. For the NGP region, the
structure function is flat, showing that the rotation measures are mostly
intrinsic to the extragalactic sources, and the ISM is very random in that part
of our Galaxy. It is obvious that the ISM fluctuation is latitude-dependent
when comparing the results in the NGP region and the CGPS regions.

BEC polarization states can be geometrically described by a Poincar\'{e} sphere

is shown that nonlinear inter-atomic interactions in the BEC induce periodic
polarization oscillations whose periods depend on the difference between
self-interaction in each component and inter-component interaction strengths.
In particular, when inter-atomic nonlinear self-interaction in each BEC
component equals inter-component nonlinear interaction, Stokes vector
associated with Stokes operators precesses around a fixed axis in the dynamic
evolution of the BEC. The value of the processing frequency is determined by
the strength of the linear coupling between two components of the BEC. When

problem of digital halftoning. \textit{Digital halftoning} is a family of
printing technologies for getting full color images from only a few different
colors deposited at dots all of the same size. The simplest version consist in
obtaining grey scale images from only black and white dots. A corollary of the
theorem is that for \textit{error diffusion}, one of the methods of digital
halftoning, averages of colors of the printed dots converge to averages of the
colors taken from the same dots of the actual images. Digital printing is a
special case of a much wider class of scheduling problems to which the theorem
applies. Convex dynamics has roots in classical areas of mathematics such as
symbolic dynamics, Diophantine approximation, and the theory of uniform
distributions.

prove that for the type $\tilde A_n$ we get a (quasi)-Garside structure. Such a
structure provides normal forms for the Artin-Tits group elements and allows to
solve some questions such as to determine the centralizer of a power of the
Coxeter element in the Artin-Tits group.
  More precisely, if $W$ is a Coxeter group, one can consider the length $l_R$
on $W$ with respect to the generating set $R$ consisting of all reflections.
Let $c$ be a Coxeter element in $W$ and let $P_c$ be the set of elements $p\in
W$ such that $c$ can be written $c=pp'$ with $l_R(c)=l_R(p)+l_R(p')$. We define
the monoid $M(P_c)$ to be the monoid generated by a set $\underline P_c$ in
one-to-one correspondence, $p\mapsto \underline p$, with $P_c$ with only
relations $\underline{pp'}=\underline p.\underline p'$ whenever $p$, $p'$ and
$pp'$ are in $P_c$ and $l_R(pp')=l_R(p)+l_R(p')$. We conjecture that the group
of quotients of $M(P_c)$ is the Artin-Tits group associated to $W$ and that it
has a simple presentation (see \ref{conjecture} (ii)). These conjectures are
known to be true for spherical type Artin-Tits groups. Here we prove them for
Artin-Tits groups of type $\tilde A$. Moreover, we show that for exactly one
choice of the Coxeter element (up to diagram automorphism) we obtain a (quasi-)
Garside monoid. The proof makes use of non-crossing paths in an annulus which
are the counterpart in this context of the non-crossing partitions used for
type $A$.

  Hopf algebras",,"Contemp. Math. 376 (2005), 127-173.",,,"math.QA math.RA",,"  We introduce the category of set-theoretic representations of a matched pair
of groupoids. This is a monoidal category endowed with a monoidal functor to
the category of quivers over the common base of the groupoids in the matched
pair (the forgetful functor). We study monoidal functors between two such
categories of representations which preserve the forgetful functor. We show
that the centralizer of such a monoidal functor is the category of
representations of a new matched pair, which we construct explicitly. We
introduce the notions of {\em double} of a matched pair of groupoids and {\em
generalized double} of a morphism of matched pairs. We show that the
centralizer of the forgetful functor is the category of representations of the
dual matched pair, and the centralizer of the identity functor (the center) is
the category of representations of the double. We use these constructions to
classify the braidings in the category of representations of a matched pair.
Such braidings are parametrized by certain groupoid-theoretic structures which
we call {\em matched pairs of rotations}.
  Finally, we express our results in terms of the weak Hopf algebra associated
to a matched pair of groupoids. A matched pairs of rotations gives rise to a
quasitriangular structure for the associated weak Hopf algebra. The Drinfeld
double of the weak Hopf algebra of a matched pair is the weak Hopf algebra
associated to the double matched pair.
