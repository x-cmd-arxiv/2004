out an inverse stellar population synthesis method which uses a database of
stellar spectra. Unlike other methods, this one provides a full knowledge of
all possible solutions as well as a good estimation of their stability;
moreover, it provides the unique approximate solution, when the problem is
overdetermined, using a rigorous minimization procedure. In Boisson et al.
(2000), this method has been applied to 10 active and 2 normal galaxies. In
this paper we analyse the results of the method after constraining the
solutions. Adding {\it a priori} physical conditions on the solutions
constitutes a good way to regularize the synthesis problem. As an illustration
we introduce physical constraints on the relative number of stars taking into
account our present knowledge of the initial mass function in galaxies. In
order to avoid biases on the solutions due to such constraints, we use
constraints involving only inequalities between the number of stars, after
dividing the H-R diagram into various groups of stellar masses. We discuss the
results for a well-known globular cluster of the galaxy M31 and discuss some of
the galaxies studied in Boisson et al. (2000). We find that, given the spectral
resolution and the spectral domain, the method is very stable according to such
constraints (i.e. the constrained solutions are almost the same as the
unconstrained one). However, an additional information can be derived about the
evolutionary stage of the last burst of star formation, but the precise age of
this particular burst seems to be questionable.

friends-of-friends group finding algorithm. Radio-loud AGN are preferentially
located in galaxy groups and poor-to-moderate richness galaxy clusters. The AGN
fraction appears to depend more strongly on the large-scale environment (group,
cluster, etc) in which a galaxy is located than on its more local environment,
except at the lowest galaxy surface densities where practically no radio-loud
AGN are found. The ratio of absorption-line to emission-line AGN changes
dramatically with environment, with essentially all radio-loud AGN in rich
environments showing no emission lines. This result could be connected with the
lack of cool gas in cluster galaxies, and may have important consequences for
analyses of optically-selected AGN, which are invariably selected on emission
line properties. The local galaxy surface density of the absorption-line AGN is
strongly correlated with radio luminosity, implying that the radio luminosities
may be significantly boosted in dense environments due to confinement by the
hot intracluster gas.
  The environments of a radio-selected sample of star forming galaxies are also
investigated to provide an independent test of optical studies. In line with
those studies, the fraction of star forming galaxies is found to decrease
strongly with increasing local galaxy surface density; this correlation extends
across the whole range of galaxy surface densities, with no evidence for the

The gravitational potential of each models is a linear combination of the
potential generated selfconsistently by the stars and the potential of a
central black hole. The relative importance of these two contributions is a
free parameter in the models. Assuming an isotropic dynamical structure, almost
all kinematical properties of these models can be calculated analytically. In
particular, they form the first simple dynamical models for galaxies with a
central black hole where the distribution function and differential energy
distribution can be written completely in terms of elementary functions only.
We also present various extensions of this family to models with anisotropic
orbital structures. Also for these dynamical models, the distribution function
and its moments can be expressed completely in terms of elementary functions.

generate initial conditions for N-body and hydrodynamical simulations to model

superexchange-energy-driven in the slave-boson resonating-valence-bond (RVB)

in the mechanisms of the pseudogap phases can be attributed to the fact that
the antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations behave quite differently in two
mean-field states, which in turn distinctly influence the kinetic energy of
charge carriers. We elaborate this based on some detailed studies of the
superexchange energy, kinetic energy, uniform spin susceptibility, equal-time
spin correlations, dynamic spin susceptibility, as well as the optical
conductivity. The results provide a consistent picture and understanding on two
physically opposite origins of pseudogap phase. In comparison with experimental

involved might be SO(3) rather than SU(2). We argue that the idea that a
version of the Pauli principle is present in loop quantum gravity allows one to
maintain SU(2) as the gauge group while still naturally achieving the desired
suppression of spin-1/2 punctures. Such an idea can be motivated by arguments
from geometric quantization even though the SU(2) under consideration does not
have the geometrical interpretation of rotations in 3-dimensional space, and
its representation labels do not correspond to physical angular momenta. In
this picture, it is natural that macroscopic areas come almost entirely from
j=1 punctures rather than j=1/2 punctures, and this is for much the same reason
that photons lead to macroscopic classically observable fields while electrons
do not.

finds some encouragement in a few scenarios, but in order to explore some key
conceptual issues it is necessary to find a well-understood toy-quantum-gravity

significant source of encouragement comes from the recent proposal of a path
for the emergence of DSR in Loop Quantum Gravity, which however relies on a few
assumptions on the results of some computations that we are still unable to
perform. Indications in favor of the possibility of using some elements of
$\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebras (and of the related $\kappa$-Minkowski
noncommutative spacetime) for the construction of a DSR theory have been
discussed extensively, but a few stubborn open issues must still be resolved,
especially in the two-particle sector. It has been recently observed that
certain structures encountered in a formulation of 2+1-dimensional
classical-gravity models would fit naturally in a DSR framework, but some key
elements of these 2+1-dimensional models, including the description of
observers, might be incompatible with the DSR principles.

reviewed, focusing on the regime of low temperatures and ``moderate''
densities, which is not accessible by perturbative QCD. Central issue is the
interplay between chiral symmetry restoration and the formation of color
superconducting phases. In order to lay a solid ground for this analysis, we
begin with a rather detailed discussion of two and three-flavor NJL models and
their phase structure, neglecting the possibility of diquark pairing in a first
step. An important aspect of this part is a comparison with the MIT bag model.
The NJL model is also applied to investigate the possibility of absolutely
stable strange quark matter. In the next step the formalism is extended to
include diquark condensates. We discuss the role and mutual influence of
several conventional and less conventional quark-antiquark and diquark
condensates. As a particularly interesting example, we analyze a spin-1 diquark
condensate as a possible pairing channel for those quarks which are left over
from the standard spin-0 condensate. For three-flavor systems, we find that a
self-consistent calculation of the strange quark mass, together with the
diquark condensates, is crucial for a realistic description of the 2SC-CFL
phase transition. We also study the effect of neutrality constraints which are
of relevance for compact stars. Both, homogeneous and mixed, neutral phases are
constructed. Although neutrality constraints generally tend to disfavor the 2SC
phase we find that this phase is again stabilized by the large values of the
dynamical strange quark mass which follow from the self-consistent treatment.
Finally, we combine our solutions with existing hadronic equations of state to
investigate the existence of quark matter cores in neutron stars.

nature in the presence of gravity, a scalar field is required and used to
describe the scale behavior of universe. In order for the scalar field to be a
physical field, a gauge field is necessary to be introduced. A gauge invariant
potential action is constructed by adopting the scalar field and a real
Wilson-like line element of the gauge field. Of particular, the conformal
scaling gauge symmetry can be broken down explicitly via fixing gauge to match
the Einstein-Hilbert action of gravity. As a nontrivial background field
solution of pure gauge has a minimal energy in gauge interactions, the
evolution of universe is then dominated at earlier time by the potential energy
of background field characterized by a scalar field. Since the background field
of pure gauge leads to an exponential potential model of a scalar field, the
universe is driven by a power-law inflation with the scale factor $a(t) \sim
t^p$. The power-law index $p$ is determined by a basic gauge fixing parameter
$g_F$ via $p = 16\pi g_F^2[1 + 3/(4\pi g_F^2) ]$. For the gauge fixing scale

leaf a finite subset of its hyperbolic boundary (as in the group case, such
subsets cannot actually contain more than 2 points). The analogous result for
actions of word hyperbolic groups with a quasi-invariant measure is that such
an action is amenable if and only if it factorizes through the hyperbolic
boundary or its symmetric square.
  A byproduct of our approach is a proof of boundary amenability for isometry
groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces under the assumption that either the space
is exponentially bounded or it is CAT(-1) and the group has a finite critical
exponent. We also give examples showing that without these assumptions the

deformation space becomes smooth after perturbing it by natural parameters,
which corresponds to moving Y through `pseudo-associative' submanifolds.
Infinitesimally, this corresponds to twisting the Dirac operator D --> D_{A}
with connections A of \nu. Furthermore, the normal bundles of the associative
submanifolds with Spin^c structure have natural complex structures, which helps
us to relate their deformations to Seiberg-Witten type equations.

associative 3-plane bundle and a complex 4-plane bundle. This allows us to
define (almost) \Lambda-associative submanifolds of M, whose deformation
equations, when perturbed, reduce to Seiberg-Witten equations, hence we can
assign local invariants to these submanifolds. Using this we can assign an
invariant to (M,\phi, \Lambda). These Seiberg Witten equations on the
submanifolds are restrictions of global equations on M. We also discuss similar
results for the Cayley submanifolds of a Spin(7) manifold.

is suggested that these axions are created in the Sun during M1 transition
between the first thermally excited level at 9.4 keV and the ground state in
$^{83}Kr$. Our method is based on axion detection via resonant absorption
process by the same nucleus in the laboratory. We use proportional gas counter
filled with krypton to detect signals for axions. With this setup, target and
detector are the same which increases the efficiency of the experiment. At
present, an upper limit on hadronic axion mass of 5.5 keV at the 95% confidence
level is obtained.

theory with non-perturbative lattice methods. In our approach nucleons and
pions are treated as point particles on a lattice. This allows us to probe
larger volumes, lower temperatures, and greater nuclear densities than in
lattice QCD. The low energy interactions of these particles are governed by
chiral effective theory and operator coefficients are determined by fitting to
zero temperature few-body scattering data. Any dependence on the lattice
spacing can be understood from the renormalization group and absorbed by
renormalizing operator coefficients. In this way we have a realistic simulation
of many-body nuclear phenomena with no free parameters, a systematic expansion,
and a clear theoretical connection to QCD. We present results for hot neutron
matter at temperatures 20 to 40 MeV and densities below twice nuclear matter
density.

impossible to describe by using the classical probability model. We discuss the
conjecture that cognitive behaviour is quantum-like. There is presented the
scheme for an experimental test for quantum-like cognitive behaviour based on a
generalization of the famous Bell's inequality. This generalization is an
analogue of Bell's inequality, but for conditional probabilities. The use of
conditional probabilities (instead of simultaneous probability distributions
for pairs of observables in the original Bell's inequality) gives the
possibility to separate two problems which are mixed in the original Bell's
framework: nonlocality and nonclassical (quantum-like) probabilistic behaviour.
Our inequality for conditional probabilities can be used for experiments with a
single system (so we need not to prepare pairs of correlated systems) to find
quantum-like behaviour. This possibility is extremely important in cognitive
sciences where it is practically impossible to prepare pairs of precisely
correlated cognitive systems.
