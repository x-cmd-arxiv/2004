QSO HE2347-4342. Absorption features of HI, CIII, CIV, NV, and OVI with up to
16 components occur in the optical spectral range located up to 1500 km/s
redwards from the emission line. Apparently, CIV and NV show the line locking
effect. A quantivative analysis of the line distribution comparing simulated
spectra with randomly distributed doublets reveals, however, no statistical
evidence for its physical reality. Using photoionization calculations to
emulate the observed ion column densities we constrain the quasar's spectral
energy distribution. Absorbers in the velocity range of 200 - 600 km/s can be
modelled successfully with a spectral index of alpha ~ -3 at energies higher
than 3 - 4 Ryd, which is an energy distribution similar to the QSO continuum
suggested by Mathews & Ferland (1987). The analysis of a group of high velocity
absorbers (v > 1300 km/s) leads to a harder energy distribution. The large
amount of helium (log N(HeII) > 16.3) associated with these absorbers implies
that they are responsible for the observed absence of the proximity effect
(Reimers et al. 1997). Clouds located more distant from the quasar may be
shielded from the high energy part of the quasar continuum due to optically
thick absorption shortward of 228 Angstrom by the high velocity absorbers. A
group of absorbers with 900 < v < 1200 km/s, in particular a cloud at 1033
km/s, which has the most reliable column density measurements, can be modelled
neither with photoionzation nor under the assumption of collisionally ionized
gas.

lower limits for the bolometric luminosity of the embedded objects of $8.7

from the stars that lie along the reddening line for early-type stars is about
1.7 $ \times$ 10$^{49}$ s$^{-1}$, enough to produce the detected flux densities
at 5 GHz. The NIR spectrum of the nebula increases with frequency, implying
that free-free emission cannot be the main source of the extended luminosity,
from which we conclude that the observed emission must be mainly dust scattered
light. A comparison of the cluster described in this paper with the young
stellar cluster associated with the IRAS source 16177-5018, which is located at
the same distance and direction, shows that the mean visual absorption of the

large fractions of their orbits in the recent years. Previously the data of the
orbit of the star S2 have been fitted with Keplerian orbits corresponding to a
massive black hole (MBH) with a mass of M$_{BH}$=3-4$\times10^6$M_sun implying
an insignificant cusp mass.However, it has also been shown that the central
black hole resides in a ~1'' diameter stellar cluster of a priori unknown mass.
In a spherical potential which is neither Keplerian nor harmonic, orbits will
precess resulting in inclined rosetta shaped trajectories on the sky. In this
case, the assumption of non-Keplerian orbits is a more physical approach. It is
also the only approach through which cusp mass information can be obtained via
stellar dynamics of the cusp members. This paper presents the first exemplary
modelling efforts in this direction. Using positional and radial data of star
S2, we find that there could exist an unobserved extended mass component of
several 10$^5$M$_{\odot}$ forming a so-called 'cusp' centred on the black hole
position. Considering only the fraction of the cusp mass M$_{S2_{apo}}$ within
the apocenter of the S2 orbit we find as an upper limit that
M$_{S2_{apo}}$/(M$_{BH}$ + M$_{S2_{apo}}$) $\le$ 0.05. A large extended cusp
mass, if present, is unlikely to be composed of sub-solar mass constituents,
but could be explained rather well by a cluster of high M/L stellar remnants,
which we find to form a stable configuration.

distribution of the Galactic bar. Adding the bar component to an axisymmetric
Galactic model, we have calculated stellar midplane orbits and orbits of some
globular clusters with known kinematical data. For all models we find a secular
dispersion effect upon the orbital energy and angular momentum, as measured in
the Galactic inertial frame. This effect might be relevant to explain the
orbital prograde-retrograde distribution of globular clusters. For the stellar
kinematics, we study the connection between the sense of orbital motion in the
midplane and the onset of chaos in the presence of the bar. In the inner region
of the bar, chaos is induced by an axisymmetric central component (bulge) and
it arises in orbits that change its orbital sense from prograde to retrograde
and vice versa as seen from an inertial reference frame. Outside the bar

densities Sigma-gas-m of 500-3500 Msun pc-2, gas mass fractions of 10--30 %,
and epicyclic frequencies of several 100--1000 km s-1 kpc-1.Consequently,
gravitational instabilities can only set in at high gas densities and grow on a
short timescale (few Myr). This high density, short timescale, `burst' mode may
explain why powerful starbursts tend to be in the CN region of galaxies. (2) We
suggest that the variety in CO morphologies is due to different stages of
bar-driven inflow. At late stages, most of the CN gas is inside the outer inner
Lindblad resonance (OILR), and has predominantly circular motions. Across the
sample, we find bar pattern speeds with upper limits of 43 to 115 km s-1 kpc-1

the starbursts is larger (1000--3500 Msun pc-2) and close to the Toomre

NLSy1s are more luminous than BLSy1s, when normalized to their central black
hole masses, which is attributed to higher mass accretion rates. However, we
find no evidence for elevated [O III]/X-ray ratios in NLSy1s, which would have
been expected if they had excess EUV continuum emission compared to BLSy1s.
Also, other studies suggest that the gas in narrow-line regions (NLR) of NLSy1s
and NLSy1s span a similar range in ionization, contrary to what is expected if
those of the former are exposed to a stronger flux of EUV radiation. The
simplest interpretation is that, like BLSy1s, a large EUV bump is not present
in NLSy1s. However, we show that the [OIII]/X-ray ratio can be lowered as a
result of absorption of the ionizing continuum by gas close to the central
source, although there is no evidence that intrinsic line-of-sight absorption
is more common among NLSy1s, as would be expected if there were a larger amount
of circumnuclear gas. Other possible explanations include: 1) anisotropic
emission of the ionizing radiation, 2) higher gas densities in the NLR of
NLSy1s, resulting in lower average ionization, or 3) the presence of strong
winds in the the nuclei of NLSy1s which may drive off much of the gas in the

bubbles that were created by interactions between powerful radio sources and
the surrounding hot gas. The minimum energy associated with the cavities ranges
between pV~10^55 erg in galaxies, groups, and poor clusters to pV~10^60 erg in
rich clusters. We evaluate the hypothesis that cooling in the hot gas can be
quenched by energy injected into the surrounding gas by the rising bubbles.
Nearly half of the systems in this study may have instantaneous mechanical
luminosities large enough to balance cooling, at least for a short period of
time, if the cavities are filled with a relativistic gas. We find a trend or
upper envelope in the distribution of central X-ray luminosity versus
instantaneous mechanical luminosity with the sense that the most powerful
cavities are found in the most X-ray luminous systems. Such a trend would be
expected if many of these systems produce bubbles at a rate that scales in
proportion to the cooling rate of the surrounding gas. Finally, we use the
X-ray cavities to measure the mechanical power of radio sources over six
decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves.
We find that the ratio of the instantaneous mechanical (kinetic) luminosity to
the 1.4 GHz synchrotron luminosity ranges from a few to roughly a thousand.
This wide range implies that the 1.4 GHz synchrotron luminosity is an

effects of cosmic rays (CRs), in magnetized gas disks (galactic disks). As an
unperturbed state for both the linear analysis and the MHD simulations, we
adopted an equilibrium model of a magnetized two-temperature layered disk with
constant gravitational acceleration parallel to the normal of the disk. The
disk comprises a thermal gas, cosmic rays and a magnetic field perpendicular to
the gravitational accelerartion. Cosmic ray diffusion along the magnetic field
is considered; cross field-line diffusion is supposed to be small and is
ignored. We investigated two cases in our simulations. In the mechanical
perturbation case we add a velocity perturbation parallel to the magnetic field
lines, while in the explosional perturbation case we add cosmic ray energy into
a sphere where the cosmic rays are injected. Linear analysis shows that the
growth rate of the Parker instability becomes smaller if the coupling between
the CR and the gas is stronger (i.e., the CR diffusion coefficient is smaller).
Our MHD simulations of the mechanical perturbation confirm this result. We show
that the falling matter is impeded by the CR pressure gradient, this causes a
decrease in the growth rate. In the explosional perturbation case, the growth
of the magnetic loop is faster when the coupling is stronger in the early
stage. However, in the later stage the behavior of the growth rate becomes
similar to the mechanical perturbation case.

surrounded by a nebulosity. The presence of the knots that are probably similar
to the HH objects in the optical wavelengths, suggests emerging jets from one
of the cluster members. These jets appear to excite a pair of knot-like objects
(Knot-NW and Knot-SE) and extend over a projected size of 0.5pc. The driving
source for the jets is traced back to a member of the cluster whose position in
the H-Ks/J-H color-color diagram indicates that it is a Class 1 type
pre-mainsequence star. We also obtained K band spectra of the brightest source
in the cluster and of the nearby nebular matter. The spectra show molecular
hydrogen emission lines but do not show Brackett gamma line at 2.167 micron.
These spectra suggest that the excitation of the molecular hydrogen lines is

  Crystals","18 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. B",,,,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  The magnetic, thermal and transport properties of Na0.75CoO2 single crystals
grown by the floating zone (FZ) method are reported. Magnetic susceptibility,
resistivity, magnetoresistance, and heat capacity data from these crystals
indicate a bulk phase transition at T1 = 22 K. These data are most consistent
with the formation of an antiferromagnet spin-density-wave (SDW) at 22 K with
the easy axis for magnetization nearly along the c axis. Weak and soft
ferromagnetism is observed for applied magnetic fields less than 0.5 T, which
suggests a slight canting of the SDW magnetization with respect to the c axis.
The jump in the heat capacity at the SDW transition is 0.45 J/K-mole-Co or
about 50% of the value expected from mean-field weak-coupling theory. The
reduced jump and the decrease in the resistivity below T1 are consistent with a
gap for only part of the Fermi surface. The magnetoresistance is small at the
SDW transition but increases in both directions reaching a value of 100% at 2 K
for applied fields of 8 Tesla. The magnetoresistance data imply that the
mobility of the remaining carriers is large and increases below T1. The
observation of a SDW transition in this material is found to be sensitive to
the preparation conditions and the degree of order in the Na layers. No SDW
transition is observed in our polycrystalline powder with the same nominal
composition (Na0.75CoO2) and lattice constants. Differential scanning
calorimetry data, however, show distinct differences between the powder and
crystal, suggesting a higher degree of order in the Na layers within the
crystal. The crystal exhibits a sharp phase transition at T2 = 340 K while for

attention here to the BEC and near-BEC regime where analytical calculations are
possible. At finite $T$, non-condensed fermion pairs must be included, although
they have been generally ignored in the literature. Within this BEC regime we
compute the equations of state for the one and two channel models; these two
cases correspond to whether Feshbach resonance effects are omitted or included.
Differences between these two cases can be traced to differences between the
nature of a Cooper pair and bosonic condensate. Our results are also compared
with the Gross Pitaevskii equations of state for true bosons. Differences found
here are associated with the underlying fermionic character of the system.
Finally, the particle density distribution functions for a trap containing
superfluid fermionic atoms are computed using a Thomas-Fermi approach. The one
and two channel behavior is found to be very different; we find a narrowing of
the density profile as a result of Feshbach resonance effects. Importantly, we
infer that the ratio between bosonic and fermionic scattering lengths depends
on the magnetic detuning and is generally smaller than 2. Future experiments
will be required to determine to what extent this ratio varies with magnetic
fields.

common in the universe. It is generally accepted that these objects are black
holes. As observations improve, it becomes possible to test this hypothesis in
ever greater detail. In particular, it is or will be possible to measure the
properties of orbits deep in the strong field of a black hole candidate (using
x-ray timing or with gravitational-waves) and to test whether they have the
characteristics of black hole orbits in general relativity. Such measurements
can be used to map the spacetime of a massive compact object, testing whether
the object's multipoles satisfy the strict constraints of the black hole
hypothesis. Such a test requires that we compare against objects with the
``wrong'' multipole structure. In this paper, we present tools for constructing
bumpy black holes: objects that are almost black holes, but that have some
multipoles with the wrong value. The spacetimes which we present are good deep
into the strong field of the object -- we do not use a large r expansion,
except to make contact with weak field intuition. Also, our spacetimes reduce
to the black hole spacetimes of general relativity when the ``bumpiness'' is
set to zero. We propose bumpy black holes as the foundation for a null
experiment: if black hole candidates are the black holes of general relativity,
their bumpiness should be zero. By comparing orbits in a bumpy spacetime with
those of an astrophysical source, observations should be able to test this
hypothesis, stringently testing whether they are the black holes of general
relativity. (Abridged)

the five-dimensional off-shell minimal supergravity multiplet. Different ways
of fixing the supersymmetry breaking order parameter are analyzed. In the
presence of supersymmetry breaking the one-loop effective potential for the

The basic class of twisted open WZW strings is in 1-to-1 correspondence with
the twisted sectors of all closed-string WZW orbifolds, and moreover, the basic
class can be decomposed into a large collection of open-string WZW orbifolds.
At the classical level, these open-string orbifolds exhibit new {\it twisted
non-commutative geometries}, and we also find the relevant {\it twisted

In a related development, we also formulate the closed-string description (in

prove that $Hameo(M,\omega)$ is path connected and so contained in the identity

orientable surface, we prove that the {\it mass flow} of any element from

strictly smaller than the identity component of the group of area preserving
homeomorphisms when $M \neq S^2$. For the case of $S^2$, we conjecture that
$Hameo(S^2,\omega)$ is still a proper subgroup of $Homeo^\omega_0(S^2) =

hole charge sum rule, or the requirement that it lead to a physical observable

rigorous upper bound to the energy is subsequently obtained by variational
minimization with respect to the parameters in the approximate wave function
functional. Hence, the terminology, the constrained-search variational method.
