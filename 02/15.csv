the Beta Cephei type. We interpret the spectrum in terms of normal mode
excitation and construct seismic models of the star. The frequency data
combined with data on mean colours sets the upper limit on the extent of
overshooting from the convective core. We use data on rotational splitting of
two dipole (l=1) modes (g_1 and p_1) to infer properties of the internal
rotation rate. Adopting a plausible hypothesis of nearly uniform rotation in
the envelope and increasing rotation rate in the mu-gradient zone, we find that
the mean rotation rate in this zone is about three times faster than in the
envelope. In our standard model only the modes in the middle part of the
oscillation spectrum are unstable. To account for excitation of a possible
high-order g-mode at nu = 0.43 c/d as well as p-modes at nu > 6 c/d we have to
invoke an overabundance of Fe in the driving zone.

except for \theta=45 degrees (\theta is the angle between the trajectory and
the surface normal); then the angle-averaged DoS behaves linearly at small
energies. This result is valid unless the crystal is 0- or 45-oriented (\alpha
\ne 0 or 45 degrees, where \alpha is the angle between the a-axis and the

angle-averaged DoS is then large at low energies. In all the cases, the
angle-resolved DoS consists of energy bands that are formed similarly to the
Kronig-Penney model. The analytical results are confirmed by a self-consistent

between these two extremal cases. The computational complexity of all studied

for modeling and sampling candidate solutions, but also for estimating their

in BOA, because population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models
of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates even if only a small
proportion of candidate solutions is evaluated using the actual fitness
function. This can lead to a reduction of the number of actual fitness
evaluations by a factor of 30 or more.

Passare : Let be Y an analytic subvariety of pure codimension p in a linearly
p-concave domain U, and w a meromorphic q-form (q>0) on Y; if the Abel
transform of w, which is meromorphic on U*, has a meromorphic prolongation to
some greater domain U' * containing U^*, then Y extends as an analytic
subvariety Y' of U', and w as a meromorphic form on Y'. We show the analogous
statement when we replace the Abel transform of w by the Abel-Radon transform
of a locally residual current on U.

neutron-core interaction, necessary to describe the corresponding borromean
nuclei $^{11}$Li and $^{6}$He can be determined in a semi-phenomenological way.
An application to the study of $^{10}$Li is then discussed and it is shown that
the scattering length for s-states at threshold can be obtained from the ratio
of experimental and theoretical cross sections. The scattering single particle
states of the system n+$^{9}$Li are obtained in a potential model. The
corresponding S-matrix is used to calculate the transfer cross section as a
function of the neutron continuum energy with respect to $^{9}$Li. Three
different reactions are calculated $^{9}Li(d,p)^{10}Li$,
$^{9}Li(^{9}Be,^{8}Be)^{10}Li$, $^{9}Li(^{13}C,^{12}C)^{10}Li$, to check the
sensitivity of the results to the target used and in particular to the transfer
matching conditions. Thus the sensitivity of the structure information
extracted from experimental data on the reaction mechanism is assessed.

system dynamics. It is shown that the wave function describes the state of
statistically averaged system $<\mathcal{S}_{st}>$, but not that of the
individual stochastic system $\mathcal{S}_{st}$. It is a common practice to
think that such a construction of quantum mechanics contains hidden variables,
and it is incompatible with the von Neumann's theorem on hidden variables. It
is shown that the original conditions of the von Neumann's theorem are not
satisfied. In particular, the quantum mechanics cannot describe the particle
momentum distribution. The distribution $w(\mathbf{p}) =| \psi_{p%}| ^{2}$ is
not a particle momentum distribution at the state $\psi $, because it cannot be
attributed to a wave function. It is closer to the mean momentum distribution,
although the two distributions do not coincide exactly.

describe, the laws of quantum mechanics impose severe restrictions on how that
state can be accessed. This paper shows in three settings that quantum messages
have only limited advantages over classical ones.
  First, we show that $\mathsf{BQP/qpoly}\subseteq\mathsf{PP/poly}$, where
$\mathsf{BQP/qpoly}$ is the class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial
time, given a polynomial-size ""quantum advice state"" that depends only on the
input length. This resolves a question of Buhrman, and means that we should not
hope for an unrelativized separation between quantum and classical advice.
Underlying our complexity result is a general new relation between
deterministic and quantum one-way communication complexities, which applies to
partial as well as total functions.
  Second, we construct an oracle relative to which $\mathsf{NP}\not \subset
\mathsf{BQP/qpoly}$. To do so, we use the polynomial method to give the first
correct proof of a direct product theorem for quantum search. This theorem has
other applications; for example, it can be used to fix a result of Klauck about
quantum time-space tradeoffs for sorting.
  Third, we introduce a new trace distance method for proving lower bounds on
quantum one-way communication complexity. Using this method, we obtain optimal
quantum lower bounds for two problems of Ambainis, for which no nontrivial
lower bounds were previously known even for classical randomized protocols.
  A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the 2004 Conference on
Computational Complexity (CCC).

entanglement of five or more particles. Although entanglement of three or four
particles has been experimentally demonstrated and used to obtain the extreme
contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism, the realization of
five-particle entanglement remains an experimental challenge. Meanwhile, a
crucial experimental challenge in multi-party quantum communication and
computation is the so-called open-destination teleportation. During
open-destination teleportation, an unknown quantum state of a single particle
is first teleported onto a N-particle coherent superposition to perform
distributed quantum information processing. At a later stage this teleported
state can be readout at any of the N particles for further applications by
performing a projection measurement on the remaining N-1 particles. Here, we
report a proof-of-principle demonstration of five-photon entanglement and
open-destination teleportation. In the experiment, we use two entangled photon
pairs to generate a four-photon entangled state, which is then combined with a
single photon state to achieve the experimental goals. The methods developed in
our experiment would have various applications e.g. in quantum secret sharing
and measurement-based quantum computation.
