or exospheric approach as well as the hydrodynamic one are both inaccurate.
However, the advantage of simplicity makes them useful for enlightening some
basic mechanisms of solar wind acceleration. Previous exospheric models have
been able to reproduce winds that were already nearly supersonic at the
exobase, the altitude above which there are no collisions. In order to allow
transonic solutions, a lower exobase has to be considered, in which case the
protons are experiencing a non-monotonic potential energy profile. This is done
in the present work. In this model, the electron velocity distribution in the
corona is assumed non-thermal. Parametric results are presented and show that
the high acceleration obtained does not depend on the details of the
non-thermal distributions. This acceleration seems, therefore, to be a robust
result produced by the presence of a sufficient number of suprathermal
electrons. A method for improving the exospheric description is also given,
which consists in mapping particle orbits in terms of their invariants of
motion.

gravitationally unstable and goes into collapse to build up protostars and
protostellar systems. Their specific angular momentum is one order of magnitude
lower than their parental cores and in agreement with observations of
main-sequence binaries.
  The ratio of rotational to gravitational energy of protostellar cores in the
model turns out to be very similar to the observed values. We find, that it is
roughly conserved during the main collapse phase. This leads to j proportional
to M^{2/3}, where j is specific angular momentum and M core mass. Although the
temporal evolution of the angular momentum of individual protostars or
protostellar systems is complex and highly time variable, this correlation
holds well in a statistical sense for a wide range of turbulent environmental
parameters. In addition, high turbulent Mach numbers result in the formation of
more numerous protostellar cores with, on average, lower mass. Therefore,
models with larger Mach numbers result in cores with lower specific angular
momentum. We find, however, no dependence on the spatial scale of the
turbulence. Our models predict a close correlation between the angular momentum
vectors of neighboring protostars during their main accretion phase. Possible
observational signatures are aligned disks and parallel outflows. The latter
are indeed observed in some low-mass isolated Bok globules.

high, accretion disk may form for orbital separation between the accreting

Our analysis shows that the one-dimensional LTE and N-LTE study finds a very
good agreement between these features. The [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relationship
derived, despite the small sample of stars, is also in agreement with the
classical figure of increasing [Mg/Fe] with decreasing metallicity. We find a
significant scatter however, in the [Mg/Fe] ratio at [Fe/H]$\sim -0.6$ which is
currently explained as a consequence of the overlap at this metallicity of
thick and thin disk stars, which were probably formed from material with
different nucleosynthesis histories. We speculate on the possible consequences
of the agreement found between Mg I and Mg II lines on the very well known
oxygen problem in metal-poor stars. We also study the [O/Mg] ratio in the

successful in natural sciences such as astrophysics or geodynamics. For

countries, study the reactions to some huge and sudden exogenous shocks, which
we call Dirac shocks. This approach naturally leads to the notion of structural
(as opposed or complementary to temporal) forecast. Although structural
predictions are by far the most common way to test theories in the natural
sciences, they have been much less used in the social sciences. The Dirac shock
approach opens the way to testing structural predictions in the social
sciences. The examples reported here suggest that critical events are able to
reveal pre-existing ``cracks'' because they probe the social cohesion which is
an indicator and predictor of future evolution of the system, and in some cases
foreshadows a bifurcation. We complement our empirical work with numerical
simulations of the response function (``damage spreading'') to Dirac shocks in
the Sznajd model of consensus build-up. We quantify the slow relaxation of the
difference between perturbed and unperturbed systems, the conditions under
which the consensus is modified by the shock and the large variability from one

interesting features. The momentum transfer from the target is very small, so
the reaction probes the macroscopic properties of the target, rather than
individual nuclei. Interference between interactions with different atoms
reduces the pair production cross section considerably below the Bethe-Heitler
values. At very high energies, photonuclear interactions may outnumber pair
production.
  In contrast, in crystals, the interaction amplitudes may add coherently,
greatly increasing the cross sections. Pair production in matter-free magnetic
fields is also possible. The highest energy pair production occurs at high
energy particle colliders. This article will compare pair production in these
very different regimes.

the algebra of these conformal transformations is not well defined on the
horizon, but also that the correct use of the eigenvalue of the operator $L_0$
yields vanishing entropy. It has been shown that these problems can be resolved
by choosing a different basis of the conformal transformations which is regular
even at the horizon. We also show the generalization of Carlip's derivation to
any higher dimensional case in pure Einstein gravity. The entropy obtained is
proportional to the area of the event horizon, but it also depends linearly on
the product of the surface gravity and the parameter length of a horizon
segment in consideration. We finally point out that this derivation of black
hole entropy is quite different from the ones proposed so far, and several
features of this method and some open issues are also discussed.

is responsible for opening the Universe and introduces a cosmological constant.
Another consequence is the appearance of inertia swirls of expanding matter,
which can explain observed velocities around galaxies, again without the
intervention of dark matter. When restricted to more everyday situations the
model degenerates in what has been called 4-dimensional optics; in the paper
this is shown to be equivalent to general relativity in all static isotropic

There is much evidence in the literature that supports this hypothesis,
including the effect of mutations on the crystallizability of a protein, the
correlations found in the properties of crystal contacts in bioinformatics

classical optics and quantum mechanical theories in phase space, especially
between the Wigner distribution functions defined in the respective phase
spaces. Classical optics is able to provide an understanding of either the
corpuscular or wave aspects of quantum mechanics, reflected in phase space
through the classical limit of the quantum Wigner distribution function or the
Wigner distribution function in classical optics, respectively. However,
classical optics, as any classical theory, cannot mimic the wave-particle
duality that is at the heart of quantum mechanics. Moreover, it is never enough
underlined that, although the mathematical phase space formalisms in classical
optics and quantum mechanics are very similar, the main difference between
these theories, evidenced in the results of measurements, is as deep as it can
get even in phase space. On the other hand, the phase space treatment allows an
unexpected similar treatment of interference phenomena, although quantum and
classical superpositions of wavefunctions and fields, respectively, have a
completely different behavior. This similarity originates in the bilinear
character of the Wigner distribution function in both quantum mechanics and
classical optical wave theory. Actually, the phase space treatment of the
quantum and classical wave theory is identical from the mathematical point of
view, if the Planck constant is replaced by the wavelength of light. Even
Wigner distribution functions of particular quantum states, such as the
Schrodinger cat state, can be mimicked by classical optical means, but not the
true quantum character, which resides in the probability significance of the
wavefunction, in comparison to the physical realness of classical wave fields.
