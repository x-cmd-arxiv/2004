galaxy cluster Abell 4059 and its central radio galaxy, PKS2354-35. We also
present new 1.4GHz and 4.7GHz CnB-array radio data from the Very Large Array
(VLA), as well as a short archival WFPC2 image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
The presence of a strong interaction between this radio galaxy and the
intracluster medium (ICM) was suggested by Huang & Sarazin (1998) on the basis
of a short observation by the High Resolution Imager on ROSAT, and confirmed in
our preliminary analysis of the Chandra/ACIS-S data. In particular, X-ray
imaging clearly shows two cavities within the ICM that are approximately
aligned with the radio-galaxy axis. However, using our new radio maps we fail
to find a detailed correspondence between the 1 arcmin scale radio-lobes and
the ICM cavities. This suggests that the cavities are ``ghosts'' of a previous
burst of powerful activity by PKS 2354-35. We also examine the nature of the
central asymmetric ridge (or bar) of X-ray emission extending for 30kpc
south-west of the cluster center that has been noted in these previous
analyzes. We find the ridge to be denser and cooler than, but probably in
pressure balance with, its surroundings. The thermal evolution of this
structure seems to be dominated by radiative cooling, possibly enhanced by the
radio-galaxy ICM interaction. We discuss several possible models for the
formation of this SW ridge and find none of them to be entirely satisfactory.

that if O(10) nearby quasar remnants were sources of proton events with energy

to write the whole modeling software as a highly interactive Java applet, which

fine-grained results on a workstation. Several obstacles come up in trying to
implement a numerically-intensive method thus, but we overcome them.

Fisher (TF) relation as luminosity evolution. However, apparent luminosity
offsets may actually reflect rotation curve anomalies such as strong
asymmetries or radial truncation, due to galaxy interactions or low S/N data.
Here we analyze emission-line rotation curves from two low-z samples: the Close
Pairs Survey, which contains many interacting galaxies, and the Nearby Field
Galaxy Survey (NFGS), which represents the general galaxy population. In the
spirit of high-z samples, these surveys reflect the natural diversity of
emission-line galaxies, including peculiar and early-type morphologies. We
adopt objective criteria to identify severe kinematic anomalies. In the Close
Pairs Survey, TF offsets associated with such anomalies collectively resemble
the ``differential luminosity evolution'' claimed in some high-z studies, with
larger offsets at lower luminosities. With anomalous galaxies rejected,
however, the TF relations for the two surveys are quite similar. Furthermore,
the two surveys follow similar relations between color and TF residuals, with
the Pairs Survey relation extending to bluer colors and brighter TF residuals.
Strong outliers from this relation are nearly always kinematically anomalous.
Thus the color-TF residual relation can serve as a powerful tool for separating
reliable luminosity offsets from offsets associated with kinematic anomalies.
We reanalyze high-z TF data from the FORS Deep Field and find: (1) overall
luminosity evolution of ~0.3 mag; (2) strong slope evolution driven by
kinematically anomalous galaxies, which show TF offsets of up to ~2 mag at low
luminosities; and (3) an additional zero-point offset of ~0.2 mag linked to
anomalous galaxies.

rocky solar system bodies orbiting beyond Neptune--is well described by a power
law at large KBO sizes. However, recent work by Bernstein et al. (2003)
indicates that the size spectrum breaks and becomes shallower for KBOs smaller
than about 70 km in size. Here we show that we expect such a break at KBO
radius ~40 km since destructive collisions are frequent for smaller KBOs.
Specifically, we assume that KBOs are rubble piles with low material strength
rather than solid monoliths. This gives a power-law slope q~3 where the number
N(r) of KBOs larger than a size r is given by $N(r) \propto r^{1-q}$; the break
location follows from this slope through a self-consistent calculation. The
existence of this break, the break's location, and the power-law slope we
expect below the break are consistent with the findings of Bernstein et al.
(2003). The agreement with observations indicates that KBOs are effectively
strengthless rubble piles.

the configurations in NGC 5506 and Mrk 1210 have multiple components with no

motion in NGC 7674 of (0.92+-0.07) c between the two central components
separated by 282 pc and, in NGC 5506, we find a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.50 c
for the components separated by 3.8 pc. Our results confirm and extend earlier
work showing that the outward motion of radio components in Seyfert galaxies is
non-relativistic on pc scales. We briefly discuss whether this non-relativistic
motion is intrinsic to the jet-formation process or results from deceleration
of an initially relativistic jet by interaction with the pc or sub-pc scale
interstellar medium. We combined our sample with a list compiled from the
literature of VLBI observations made of Seyfert galaxies, and found that most
Seyfert nuclei have at least one flat-spectrum component on the VLBI scale,
which was not seen in the spectral indices measured at arcsec resolution. We
found also that the bimodal alignment of pc and kpc radio structures displayed
by radio galaxies and quasars is not displayed by this sample of Seyferts,
which shows a uniform distribution of misalignment between 0 deg and 90 deg.
The frequent misalignment could result from jet precession or from deflection
of the jet by interaction with gas in the interstellar medium.

processes include the modified Urca process, and the direct Urca process for
nucleons and exotic states of matter such as a pion condensate, kaon

physical input and observations of thermal radiation from isolated neutron
stars are described. The comparison of observation and theory leads to a
unified interpretation in terms of three characteristic types of neutron stars:
high-mass stars which cool primarily by some version of the direct Urca
process; low-mass stars, which cool via slower processes; and medium-mass
stars, which have an intermediate behavior. The related problem of thermal

that of the entire Milky Way. Collisions of gas-rich spirals are really
collisions between the interstellar media (ISMs) of the galaxies. We show that
collisions between molecular clouds bring H2 into the bridge region. Although
the dense clouds are ionized by the collisions, they cool and recombine very
quickly and become molecular again even before the galactic disks separate.
Because the clouds acquire an intermediate velocity post-collision, they are
left in the bridge between the separating galaxies. The star formation
efficiency appears low in the molecular clouds in the bridges. We speculate
that the pre-stellar cores in the molecular clouds may expand during the cloud
collisions, thus retarding future star formation. Because the ISM-ISM
collisions discussed here require a very small impact parameter, they are rare
among field spirals. In clusters, however, these collisions should be an
important means of ejecting enriched gas from the inner parts of spirals.

moderately. Several effects, in particular baryonic settling and the
requirement of compactness, may further decrease the predictions by a factor of
few. The predicted fraction with appropriate properties thus appears to be
lower than that required by lensing, although both are still uncertain. More

of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) double-diffusive analysis to the
magnetized and resistive, triple-diffusive case. Our fifth-order dispersion
relation admits a novel branch which describes a magnetized version of
multi-diffusive modes. We derive necessary conditions for axisymmetric
stability in the inviscid and perfect-conductor (double-diffusive) limits. In
each case, rotation must be constant on cylinders and angular velocity must not
decrease with distance from the rotation axis for stability, irrespective of
the relative strength of viscous, resistive and heat diffusion. Therefore, in
both double-diffusive limits, solid body rotation marginally satisfies our
stability criteria. The role of weak magnetic fields is essential to reach
these conclusions. The triple-diffusive situation is more complex, and its
stability criteria are not easily stated. Numerical analysis of our general
dispersion relation confirms our analytic double-diffusive criteria, but also
shows that an unstable double-diffusive situation can be significantly
stabilized by the addition of a third, ostensibly weaker, diffusion process. We
describe a numerical application to the Sun's upper radiative zone and
establish that it would be subject to unstable multi-diffusive modes if

degenerate iron gas with an arbitrary degree of relativity is taken for the
atmospheric matter. We construct a family of toroidal model atmospheres with
total masses $M \approx 0.1 \div 0.2 M_{\odot}$ and total angular momenta $J
\approx (1 \div 5.5) \cdot 10^{49} erg \cdot s$, which are acceptable for the
outer part of the collapsed iron core, in accordance with the hydrodynamic
model, as a function of constant parameters $\omega_{0} and r_{0}$ of the
specified differential rotation law $\Omega =
\omega_{0}\exp{\Big[-\frac{(r\sin{\Theta})^{2}}{r_{0}^{2}}\Big]}$ in spherical
coordinates. The assumed rotation law is also qualitatively consistent with the
hydrodynamic model for the collapse of an iron core.

the appearance of electron-positron pairs, the presence of radiation, and the
possibility of iron nuclei dissociating into free nucleons and helium nuclei.
We performed calculations with the help of a numerical scheme based on
Godunov's method. These calculations allowed us to ascertain whether the
emersion of the outer envelope in a massive star is possible through the
following two mechanisms: first, the decrease in the gravitational mass of the
central PNS through neutrino-signal emission and, second, the effect of hot
nucleon bubbles, which are most likely formed in the PNS corona, on the
envelope emersion. We show that the second mechanism is highly efficient in the
range of acceptable masses of the nucleon bubbles ($\leq 0.01M_\odot$)

approximation.

impact of each dataset and of various priors on our bounds. For the standard
case of three thermalized neutrinos, we find an upper bound on the total

bound that is quite insensitive to the splitting of the total mass between the
three species. When the total number of neutrinos or relativistic relics N_eff
is left free, the upper bound on sum m_nu (at 2sigma, including all priors)
ranges from 1.0 to 1.5 eV depending on the mass splitting. We provide an
explanation of the parameter degeneracy that allows larger values of the masses

mass is not significantly modified in the presence of primordial gravitational
waves, because current data provide a clear distinction between the
corresponding effects.

dynamically bound into diquarks has been used to predict that the recently
observed exotic baryons (pentaquarks) fall into a nearly ideally mixed
combination of an octer and anti-decuplet representations of SU(3) flavor. The
model predicts two states with nucleon quantum numbers which have tentatively
been identified with the N*(1440) and the N*(1710). This paper examines the
viability of this model by focusing on the decay width of the nucleon members
of the multiplet. An inequality relating the partial widths of these nucleon
states in the N+nucleon channel to the width of the theta+ is derived for this
model under the assuming ideal mixing and that the only significant exact SU(3)
symmetry violations are the result of ideal mixing, threshold effects and the
masses of pseudo-Goldstone bosons. This inequality is badly violated if the
states in the multiplet are the N*(1440) and the N*(1710) and if the recent
bounds extracted for the theta+ width are reliable. Thus, the model appears to
require a scenario with the existence of at least one presently unknown
resonance with nucleon quantum numbers.

doing this, we adopt the idea recently introduced by Shuryak and Zahed for
charmed $\bar c c$, light-quark $\bar q q$ mesons $\pi, \sigma, \rho, A_1$ and
gluons that at T_zb, the quark-antiquark scattering length goes through
infinity at which conformal invariance is restored, thereby transforming the
matter into a near perfect fluid behaving hydrodynamically, as found at RHIC.
We show that the binding of these states is accomplished by the combination of
(i) the color Coulomb interaction, (ii) the relativistic effects, and (iii) the
interaction induced by the instanton-anti-instanton molecules. The spin-spin
forces turned out to be small. While near T_zb all mesons are large-size
nonrelativistic objects bound by Coulomb attraction, near T_c they get much
more tightly bound, with many-body collective interactions becoming important
and making the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ masses approach zero (in the chiral limit).
The wave function at the origin grows strongly with binding, and the near-local
four-Fermi interactions induced by the instanton molecules play an increasingly
more important role as the temperature moves downward toward T_c.

follows from our examination, uncertainties in muon flux measurements and in

FI terms. The FI terms induce non-vanishing R-charges for the fermions and the

constant FI terms has to be revisited.
  We also investigate the case of the so-called anomalous U(1) when a chiral
superfield is shifted under U(1). In such a case, in the context of string
theory, the FI terms originate from the derivative of the Kaehler potential and
they are inevitably field-dependent. This raises an issue of stabilization of
the relevant field in applications to cosmology.
  The recently suggested equivalence between the D-term strings and D-branes of
type II theory shows that brane-anti-brane systems produce FI terms in the
effective 4d theory, with the Ramond-Ramond axion shifting under the U(1)
symmetry. This connection gives the possibility to interpret many unknown
properties of D-\bar{D} systems in the more familiar language of 4d
supergravity D-terms, and vice versa. For instance, the shift of the axion
field in both cases restricts the possible forms of the moduli-stabilizing
superpotential. We provide some additional consistency checks of the
correspondence of D-term-strings to D-branes and show that instabilities of the
two are closely related. Surviving cosmic D-strings of type II theory may be
potentially observed in the form of D-term strings of 4d supergravity.

non-vanishing constant four-form flux in eleven-dimensional spacetime. First,
we discuss the Matrix theory on the plane-wave background suggested by
Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase. We construct the Hamiltonian, 32
supercharges and their commutation relations. We discuss a spectrum of one
specific supermultiplet which represents the center of mass degrees of freedom
of N D0-branes. This supermultiplet would also represent a superparticle of the
eleven-dimensional supergravity in the large-N limit. Second, we study the
linearized supergravity on the plane-wave background in eleven dimensions.
Fixing the bosonic and fermionic fields in the light-cone gauge, we obtain the
spectrum of physical modes. We obtain the fact that the energies of the states
in Matrix theory completely correspond to those of fields in supergravity.
Thus, we find that the Matrix theory on the plane-wave background contains the
zero-mode spectrum of the eleven-dimensional supergravity completely. Through
this result, we can argue the Matrix theory on the plane-wave as a candidate of
quantum extension of eleven-dimensional supergravity, or as a candidate which

vector which induces a natural 2+4 split of the six dimensional spacetime. A
suitable combination of the field equations implies that the scalar curvature
of the four dimensional Riemannian part, referred to as the base, obeys a
second order differential equation. Bosonic fluxes introduce torsion terms that
deform the $SU(2)\ltimes\mathbb{R}^4$ structure away from a covariantly
constant one. The most general structure can be classified in terms of its
intrinsic torsion. For a large class of solutions the gauge field strengths
admit a simple geometrical interpretation: in the U(1) theory the base is
K\""{a}hler, and the gauge field strength is the Ricci form; in the SU(2)
theory, the gauge field strengths are identified with the curvatures of the
left hand spin bundle of the base. We employ our general ansatz to construct
new supersymmetric solutions; we show that the U(1) theory admits a symmetric
Cahen-Wallach$_4\times S^2$ solution together with a compactifying pp-wave. The
SU(2) theory admits a black string, whose near horizon limit is $AdS_3\times
S_3$. We also obtain the Yang-Mills analogue of the Salam-Sezgin solution of
the U(1) theory, namely $R^{1,2}\times S^3$, where the $S^3$ is supported by a
sphaleron. Finally we obtain the additional constraints implied by enhanced

in which point singularities are interpreted as electrons is reevaluated. Using
covariant quaternionic integration techniques developed by Paul Weiss in 1941,
we show that the Lagrangian suggested by Lanczos in his thesis of 1919 is
equivalent to the standard Lagrangian of classical electrodynamics. On the
mathematical side, Lanczos's thesis contains the correct generalizations of the
Cauchy-Riemann regularity conditions, and of Cauchy's formula, from complex
numbers to quaternions. Lanczos therefore anticipated Moisil-Fueter's discovery
of 1931 by more than 12 years.

multiplication rule analogous to the stuffle multiplication rule arising from
the series representation of ordinary multiple zeta values. Additionally,
multiple $q$-zeta values can be viewed as special values of the multiple
$q$-polylogarithm, which admits a multiple Jackson $q$-integral representation
whose limiting case is the Drinfel'd simplex integral for the ordinary multiple
polylogarithm when $q=1$. The multiple Jackson $q$-integral representation for
multiple $q$-zeta values leads to a second multiplication rule satisfied by
them, referred to as a $q$-shuffle. Despite this, it appears that many
numerical relations satisfied by ordinary multiple zeta values have no
interesting $q$-extension. For example, a suitable $q$-analog of Broadhurst's
formula for $\zeta(\{3,1\}^n)$, if one exists, is likely to be rather
complicated. Nevertheless, we show that a number of infinite classes of
relations, including Hoffman's partition identities, Ohno's cyclic sum
identities, Granville's sum formula, Euler's convolution formula, Ohno's

patterns. We clarify the role of the rhombic condition in both theories: under
this condition the corresponding equations are integrable (in the sense of 3D
consistency, which yields also the existense of zero curvature representations,
B""acklund transformations etc.). We demonstrate that in some precise sense the
linear theory is a linearization of the nonlinear one: the tangent space to a
set of integrable circle patterns at an isoradial point consists of discrete
holomorphic functions which take real (imaginary) values on two sublattices. We
extend solutions of the basic equations of both theories to Z^d, where d is the
number of different edge slopes of the quasicrystallic tiling. In the linear
theory, we give an integral representation of an arbitrary discrete holomorphic
function, thus proving the density of discrete exponential functions. We

generalization of Kenyon's discrete Green's function, and uncover several new

correlation functions 1 + R \approx 1.3 for inclusive event samples reflect the
strong correlations evident from the common impact-parameter dependence of the
considered multiplicities. For narrow impact-parameter bins (based on
charged-particle multiplicity), the correlation functions are close to unity
and do not indicate strong additional correlations. Only for pions at high
particle multiplicities (central collisions) a weak anticorrelation is
observed, probably due to a limited competition between these emissions.
Overall, the results are consistent with the equilibrium assumption made in
statistical multifragmentation scenarios. Predictions obtained with
intranuclear cascade models coupled to the Statistical Multifragmentation Model

Notably, at low pressures (ca. <0.08 Torr), a significant fraction (ca. 20%) of
the atomic hydrogen was 'hot' with energies greater than 40 eV with a pressure
dependence, but only a weak power dependence. The degree of broadening was
virtually independent of the position studied within the GEC cell, similar to
the recent finding for He/H2 and Ar/H2 plasmas in the same GEC cell. In
contrast to the atomic hydrogen lines, no broadening was observed in oxygen
species lines at low pressures. Also, in control Xe/H2 plasmas run in the same
cell at similar pressures and adsorbed power, no significant broadening of
atomic hydrogen, Xe, or any other lines was observed. Stark broadening or
acceleration of charged species due to high electric fields can not explain the
results since (i) the electron density was insufficient by orders of magnitude,
(ii) the RF field was essentially confined to the cathode fall region in
contrast to the broadening that was independent of position, and (iii) only the
atomic hydrogen lines were broadened. Rather, all of the data is consistent
with a model that claims specific, predicted, species can act catalytically
through a resonant energy transfer mechanism to create hot hydrogen atoms in

limits of human longevity. Partially, the conflicting assertions are based upon
demographic evidence and the interpretation of survival and mortality curves
using the Gompertz model and the Weibull model; these models are sometimes
considered to be incomplete in describing the entire curves. In this paper a
new model is proposed to take the place of the traditional models. We directly
analysed the rectangularity (the parts of the curves being shaped like a
rectangle) of survival curves for 17 countries and for 1876-2001 in Switzerland
(it being one of the longest-lived countries) with a new model. This model is
derived from the Weibull survival function and is simply described by two
parameters, in which the shape parameter indicates 'rectangularity' and
characteristic life indicates the duration for survival to be 'exp(-1)'. The
shape parameter is essentially a function of age and it distinguishes humans
from technical devices. We find that although characteristic life has increased
up to the present time, the slope of the shape parameter for middle age has
been saturated in recent decades and that the rectangularity above
characteristic life has been suppressed, suggesting there are ultimate limits
to human longevity. The new model and subsequent findings will contribute
greatly to the interpretation and comprehension of our knowledge on the human
ageing processes.
