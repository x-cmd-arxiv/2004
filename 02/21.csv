polarization is partially sourced by the local temperature quadrupole. We link
the temperature with the polarization spectrum directly by relating the local
quadrupole at the onset of reionization to both of them. The dominant
contribution is at l<30 and since we use many l values, we can reduce the error
significantly below cosmic variance. In particular, for our fiducial model, the
error on the temperature quadrupole is reduced to 24%. This has the potential
of reducing the probability of a low quadrupole by two orders of magnitude.

build-up of SMBH in the nuclei of galaxies, based on observations of the
evolving radio and (hard) X-ray luminosity functions of AGN. The fundamental
plane of black hole activity discovered by Merloni, Heinz & Di Matteo (2003) is
used as a mass and accretion rate estimator. I adopt the local BH mass function
as a boundary condition to integrate backwards in time the continuity equation
for the SMBH evolution, neglecting the role of mergers. Under the most general
assumption that accretion proceeds in a radiatively efficient way above a
certain rate, and in a radiatively inefficient way below, the redshift
evolution of the mass and accretion rate functions are calculated
self-consistently. The only tunable parameters are the accretion efficiency and
the critical ratio of the X-ray to Eddington luminosity at which the transition
between accretion modes takes place. For fiducial values of these parameters, I
found that half (85%) of the local BH mass density was accumulated at redshift
z<1 (z<3), mostly in radiatively efficient episodes of accretion. The evolution
of the BH mass function between z=0 and z~3 shows clear signs of an
anti-hierarchical behaviour: while the majority of the most massive objects (M
> 10^9) were already in place at z~3, lower mass ones mainly grew at
progressively lower redshift. Also, the average accretion rate decreases with
time. Consequently, sources in the radiatively inefficient regime of accretion
only begin to dominate the comoving accretion energy density in the universe at
z<1. I discuss the implications of these results for the efficiency of
accretion onto SMBH, the quasars lifetimes and duty cycles and the history of
AGN feedback in the form of mechanical energy output (abriged).

spectral energy distribution (SED) of O main sequence (dwarf) stars, focussing
on the hydrogen and helium ionizing continua, and on the optical and near-IR
lines used for spectral classification. The spectra are based on non-LTE line
blanketed atmosphere models with stellar winds calculated using the CMFGEN code
of Hillier & Miller (1998). We draw the following conclusions. First, we find
that the total number of Lyman photons emitted is almost independent of line
blanketing effects and metallicity for a given effective temperature. This is
because the flux that is blocked by the forest of metal lines at wavelengths
shorter than 600 Angstrom is redistributed mainly within the Lyman continuum.
Second, the spectral type, as defined by the ratio of the equivalent widths of
HeI 4471 Angstrom and HeII 4542 Angstrom, is shown to depend noticeably on the
microturbulent velocity in the atmosphere, on metallicity and, within the
luminosity class of dwarfs, on gravity. Third, we confirm the decrease in the
effective temperature for a given spectral type due to the inclusion of line
blanketing recently found by e.g. Martins et al. (2002). Finally, we find that
the SED below ~450 Angstrom is highly dependent on metallicity. This is
reflected in the behaviour of nebular fine-structure line ratios such as
[NeIII]/[NeII] 15.5/12.8 and [ArIII]/[ArII] 9.0/7.0 micron. This dependence
complicates the use of these nebular ratios as diagnostic tools for the
effective temperature determination of the ionizing stars in HII regions and
for age dating of starburst regions in galaxies.

light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less
restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high resolution dark matter
simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity
functions.
  We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy
luminosity is fairly well fit by a double power law, while that between halo
mass and group luminosity is fairly well fit by a two branch function, with
both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to $L\propto M^4$ at
low $M$, while at high mass the former follows $L\propto M^{0.28}$ and the
latter $L\propto M^{0.9}$.
  We also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of
cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then,
using some additional assumptions, we further derive results for biasing
between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, light distribution function
and the void probability distribution. Our results for the most part seem to
match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a
potentially powerful way of modelling this relation, since the main inputs are
readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys.

uniform rotation, which has important consequences in many astrophysical
contexts. For example, merging binary neutron stars can form a ""hypermassive""
remnant, i.e. a differentially rotating star with a mass greater than the
maximum allowed by uniform rotation. The removal of the centrifugal support
provided by differential rotation can lead to delayed collapse of the remnant
to a black hole, accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation. Both
magnetic fields and viscosity alter the structure of differentially rotating
stars on secular timescales, making numerical tracking of the evolution
difficult. Here, we present the first simulations of rapidly rotating stars
with shear viscosity in full general relativity. We self-consistently include
viscosity in our relativistic hydrodynamic code to solve the relativistic
Navier-Stokes equations both in axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. In
axisymmetry, we follow secular evolution with high resolution over dozens of
rotation periods (thousands of M). We find that viscosity operating in a
hypermassive star generically leads to the formation of a compact, uniformly
rotating core surrounded by a low-density disk. These uniformly rotating cores
are often, but not always, unstable to gravitational collapse. In the unstable
cases, we follow the collapse and determine the mass and the spin of the final
black hole and ambient disk. In all cases studied, the rest mass of the
resulting disk is found to be 10-20% of the original star, whether surrounding
a uniformly rotating core or a rotating black hole. This study foreshadows more
detailed, future simulations of secular processes, including magnetic effects,
in relativistic stars.

minor mergers and accretion until the present epoch, acquire by tidal torques

the Balmer lines, HeI 5876, and HeII 4686. Unlike most of the prominent heavy
element lines found in the UV, the optical hydrogen and helium recombination
lines' emissivities are strongly dependent upon the incident continuum flux,
since these lines arise out of excited states whose optical depths depend upon
the incident flux of photons. Using photoionization calculations we determine
the luminosity-dependent responsivities of these lines for a general model of
the broad emission line region (BLR), with the purpose of establishing them as
important probes of the physical conditions within the BLR of AGNs. The
dependence of these lines' emissivities on the incident photon flux invokes a
dependence in their responsivities on distance from the central continuum
source. In particular, the responsivities of these lines are generally
anti-correlated with the incident photon flux. Thus, their responsivities vary
with distance within the BLR for a fixed continuum luminosity and change with
time as the continuum source varies. Consequently, after correcting for light
travel time effects the response of the Balmer and optical helium lines should
generally be strongest during low continuum luminosity states. Responsivity
that depends upon photon flux and continuum state may explain a number of
outstanding problems currently under investigation in broad line variability
studies of these and other emission lines. [Abridged]

the context of geometrical models of the radio emission from pulsars. We find
that at low altitudes the rotation deflects the local direction of the magnetic
field by at most an angle of the order of r_n^2, where r_n = r/Rlc, r is the
radial distance of the radio emission and Rlc is the light cylinder radius. To
the second order in r_n, this distortion is symmetrical with respect to the
plane containing the dipole axis and the rotation axis (Omega-mu plane). The
lowest order distortion which is asymmetrical with respect to the Omega-mu
plane is third order in r_n. We show, however, that the influence of the
sweepback on the outer boundary of the open field line region (open volume) is
a much larger effect, of the order of r_n^1/2. The open volume is shifted
backwards with respect to the rotation direction by an angle delta_ov ~ 0.2
sin(alpha) r_n^1/2 where alpha is the dipole inclination with respect to the
rotation axis. The associated phase shift of the pulse profile Delta_phi_ov ~
0.2 r_n^1/2 can easily exceed the shift due to combined effects of aberration
and propagation time delays (=~ 2r_n). This strongly affects the misalignment
of the center of the PA curve and the center of the pulse profile, thereby
modifying the delay-radius relation. Contrary to intuition, the effect of
sweepback dominates over other effects when emission occurs at low altitudes.
For r_n <~ 0.003 the shift becomes negative, ie. the center of the position
angle curve precedes the profile center. With the sweepback effect included,
the modified delay-radius relation predicts larger emission radii and is in
much better agreement with the other methods of determining r_n.

ultrasensitive mass detection. In these experiments, a modulated flux of atoms
was adsorbed upon the surface of a 32.8 MHz NEMS resonator within an ultrahigh

adsorbates were then measured to ascertain a mass sensitivity of 2.53x10^-18 g.
In these initial measurements, this sensitivity is limited by the noise in the
NEMS displacement transducer; the ultimate, limits of the technique are set by
fundamental phase noise processes. Our results and analysis indicate that mass
sensing of individual molecules will be realizable with optimized NEMS devices.

explo re the possibility of the plasmon exchange mechanism for

complex reflection coefficient for neutron specularly reflected from a film,
yields unique results. Recently it has been shown that the phase can be
determined by using controlled variation of the scattering length density of
the fronting (incident) and/or backing (substrate) medium instead of reference
layers of finite thickness. This method is applicable under the simplifying
assumption that the backing is infinitely thick (semi-infinite substrate). By
this assumption the reflected beams from the end side of the backing is
neglected, which appears reasonable since in most cases absorption will damp
out the neutron current before it has reached the end side. But for weakly
absorbing backing, the reflection from the end side may be considerable. So
backing must be considered as a thick matter. We show that for this kind of
backing, using method of variation of the backing, as an example of variation
of the surroundings, leads to completely wrong answer in determination of the

without invoking a fundamental Higgs scalar. We reveal that massive gauge boson

the higher dimensional gauge theory. We demonstrate that this is a generic
consequence of the ``geometric Higgs mechanism'' (GHM), manifested via

many gauge KK states below the UV cutoff scale imposes strong bounds on the
highest KK level (N_KK). Applying these bounds to higher-dimensional SUSY GUTs
implies that only a small number of KK states can be used to accelerate gauge

such relevant double-trace perturbation introduces changes in the coefficients
in the boundary terms of the action, which in turn govern the existence of a
bound state in the bulk. For instance, we show that the usual action,
containing no additional boundary terms, gives rise to a bound state, which can
be avoided only through the addition of a proper boundary term. Another
notorious example is that of a conformally coupled scalar field, supplemented
by a Gibbons-Hawking term, for which there is no associated bound state. In
general, in both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases, we explicitly
compute the boundary terms which give rise to a bound state, and which ones do
not. In the non-minimally coupled case, and when the action is supplemented by
a Gibbons-Hawking term, this also fixes allowed values of the coupling
coefficient to the metric. We interpret our results as the fact that the
requirement to satisfy the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound does not suffice to
prevent tachyonic behavior from existing in the bulk, as it must be
supplemented by additional conditions on the coefficients in the boundary terms

proof of this statement but also generalizes it to any connected
$n$-dimensional stellar manifold with a finite number of vertices. The study of
an $n$-dimensional stellar sphere with the boundary faces identified in pairs
leads us to Coxeter groups of stellar manifolds. Analysis of these Coxeter
groups allows us to single out the class of so called flat stellar manifolds.
Flat stellar manifolds are not only very common but also possess a range of
simple properties that allow to prove some difficult long standing statements.
In particular, there exists a simple proof of the Poincar\`e conjecture for
flat manifolds.It is not possible to carry out this simple proof for a general
stellar manifolds because of certain singularities that can be characterized in
terms of Coxeter groups. The results and ideas presented in this paper not only
open a new way that may lead to entirely combinatorial and algebraic proof of
the Poincar\`e conjecture but also suggest a new technique for studying stellar

from the random graph theory but to answer it we treat it as a dynamical system

following bifurcation problem: Given a probability measure $\mu$, which
corresponds to the weight distribution of a link of a random graph we form a
positive linear operator $\Phi$
  (convolution) on distribution functions and then we analyze a family of its
exponents with a parameter $\lambda$ which corresponds to connectivity of a

convolution $\Phi$) and every $\lambda< e$ there exists a unique globally
attracting fixed point of the operator, which yields the existence and
uniqueness of the limit probability distribution on the random graph. This
estimate was established earlier \cite{KarpSipser} for deterministic weight
distributions (Dirac measures $\mu$) and is known as $e$-cutoff phenomena, as

emission and readjustment of system density and momentum distribution toward an
equilibrated system. Good agreement with data, on the d/p and t/p yield ratios

fm/c from the start of a reaction, provided reduced in-medium cross-sections

then, the pre-equilibrium nucleon and cluster emission, as well as mean-field
readjustments, drive the system to a state of depleted average density,
rho/rho_{0} ~ 1/4-1/3 for central collisions, and low-to-moderate excitation,

between a quasi-classical motion of a quantum particle with a spin and GO of an
electromagnetic wave in smoothly inhomogeneous media, we have introduced the
standard gauge potential associated with the degeneracy in the wave momentum
space. This potential corresponds to the Dirac-monopole-like field (Berry
curvature), which causes the topological spin (polarization) transport of
photons. The deviations of waves of right-hand and left-hand helicity occur in
the opposite directions and orthogonally to the principal direction of motion.
This produces a spin current directed across the principal motion. The
situation is similar to the anomalous Hall effect for electrons. In addition, a
simple scheme of the experiment allowing one to observe the topological spin
splitting of photons has been suggested.

approaches to the solution of this model have been available, yet a new
approach is presented here, which is very suitable for the study of cyclic
solutions and geometric phases. In this approach, finding the time evolution
operator for the Schr\""odinger equation is reduced to solving an ordinary
differential equation for a c-number vector which moves on a hyperboloid in a
three-dimensional space. Cyclic solutions do not exist for all time intervals.
A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of cyclic solutions is
given. There may exist some particular time interval in which all solutions
with definite parity, or even all solutions, are cyclic. Criterions for the
appearance of such cases are given. The known relation that the nonadiabatic
geometric phase for a cyclic solution is proportional to the classical Hannay
angle is reestablished. However, this is valid only for special cyclic
solutions. For more general ones, the nonadiabatic geometric phase may contain
an extra term. Several cases with relatively simple Hamiltonians are solved and
discussed in detail. Cyclic solutions exist in most cases. The pattern of the
motion, say, finite or infinite, can not be simply determined by the nature of
the Hamiltonian (elliptic or hyperbolic, etc.). For a Hamiltonian with a
definite nature, the motion can changes from one pattern to another, that is,
some kind of phase transition may occur, if some parameter in the Hamiltonian
goes through some critical value.

setups in the two imaging paths, including the crucial point regarding how to
engineer the phase of the idler local oscillator as to observe the desired
orthogonal quadrature components of the image. We point out an inherent link
between the far-field bandwidth and the near-field resolution of the reproduced
image, determined by the bandwidth of the source of the correlated beams.
However, we show how to circumvent this limitation by using a spatial averaging
technique which dramatically improves the imaging bandwidth of the far-field
