of which is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I at a spectral type of M8

for the cluster. Chamaeleon I has a median age of ~2 Myr according to

older than Taurus (~1 Myr). The measurement of an IMF for Chamaeleon I from

power spectra have simple dominant features, the two kilohertz oscillations, a
low frequency oscillation, and band-limited white noise. They vary
systematically with changes in other source properties and offer the
possibility of comparison with model predictions. New information from the

at large radii. The observed surface density profile shows a central peak, a
zone of avoidance and a rise beyond twenty core radii. In light of these

correspondence between pion condensation, occurring in neutron matter due to
critical spin-isospin fluctuations, and the metal-insulator phase transition in
a two-dimensional electron gas. Beyond the threshold density for pion
condensation, where neutron-star matter loses its spatial homogeneity, the
neutron single-particle spectrum acquires an insulating gap that quenches
neutron contributions to neutrino-production reactions and to the star's
specific heat. In the liquid phase at densities below the transition point,
spin-isospin fluctuations are found to play dual roles. On the one hand, they
lead to a multi-sheeted neutron Fermi surface that extends to low momenta,
thereby activating the normally forbidden direct-Urca cooling mechanism; on the
other, they amplify the nodeless $P$-wave neutron superfluid gap while
suppressing $S$-wave pairing. In this picture, lighter stars without a
pion-condensed core experience slow cooling, while enhanced cooling occurs in
heavier stars through direct-Urca emission from a narrow shell of the interior.

model, the random walkers interact through excluded volume interaction
(single-file system); and the total number of walkers in the lattice can
fluctuate because of exchange with a bath.In addition, the movement of the
random walkers is biased by an external perturbation. Two models for the latter
are considered: (1) an inverse potential (V $\propto$ 1/r), where r is the
distance between the center of the perturbation and the random walker and (2)
an inverse of sixth power potential ($V \propto 1/r^6 $). The calculated
density of the walkers and the total energy show interesting dynamics. When the
size of the system is comparable to the range of the perturbing field, the
energy relaxation is found to be highly non-exponential. In this range, the
system can show stretched exponential ($ e^{-{(t/\tau_s)}^{\beta}} $) and even
logarithmic time dependence of energy relaxation over a limited range of time.
Introduction of density exchange in the lattice markedly weakens this

  versus traveling waves",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.71.013404",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the diffraction of quantum degenerate fermionic atoms off of
quantized light fields in an optical cavity. We compare the case of a linear
cavity with standing wave modes to that of a ring cavity with two
counter-propagating traveling wave modes. It is found that the dynamics of the
atoms strongly depends on the quantization procedure for the cavity field. For
standing waves, no correlations develop between the cavity field and the atoms.
Consequently, standing wave Fock states yield the same results as a classical
standing wave field while coherent states give rise to a collapse and revivals
in the scattering of the atoms. In contrast, for traveling waves the scattering
results in quantum entanglement of the radiation field and the atoms. This
leads to a collapse and revival of the scattering probability even for Fock
states. The Pauli Exclusion Principle manifests itself as an additional
dephasing of the scattering probability.

in supercontinuum generation. We also show laser induced polarization
preference in the supercontinuum generating media. These results have become
possible through the choice of isotropic and anisotropic samples interacting
with ultrashort laser pulses of changing ellipticity. Laser polarization
emerges as an important control parameter for the highly nonlinear phenomenon
of supercontinuum generation.
