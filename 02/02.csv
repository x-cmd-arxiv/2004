black-hole microquasars with frequencies that have been shown to scale as 1/M,
as expected for general relativisitic motion near a black hole. It may be
possible to extend this result to distinguish between the following two
disparate models that have been proposed for the puzzling ultraluminous X-ray
sources (ULXs): (1) an intermediate-mass black hole M ~1000 solar mass)
radiating very near the Eddington limit and (2) a conventional black hole (M ~
10 solar mass) accreting at a highly super-Eddington rate with its emission
beamed along the rotation axis. We suggest that it may be possible to
distinguish between these models by detecting the counterpart of a Galactic
twin-peak QPO in a ULX: the expected frequency for the intermediate-mass black
hole model is only about 1 Hz, whereas, for the conventional black hole model
the expected frequency would be the ~100 Hz value observed for the Galactic
microquasars.

detectable high velocity components within 1500 km s^-1 on either side of the

might belong to a class of megamaser galaxies in which the amplified emission
is the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching
molecular cloud, rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk. Our initial
VLBA observations show that the maser emission emanates entirely from a region
<0.25 pc in extent, located toward a continuum component thought to be
associated with the receding jet. The very high linewidth occurring on such
small spatial scales and the rapid variability indicate that the H_2O emission
is likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic
jet material and the molecular gas in the cloud where the jet is boring
through. The orientation of the radio jets close to the plane of the sky also
results in shocks with the preferred orientation for strong masers from our
vantage point. Single-dish monitoring with the Effelsberg 100m telescope showed
that the line and continuum emission ""flared"" on very similar timescales. The
close temporal correlation between this activity in the maser emission and the
continuum flare further suggest that the masing region and the continuum
hotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different
manifestations of the same dynamical events.

supported by thermal pressure alone, suggesting significant non-thermal
pressure if the cores are to be stable. Non-thermal support is also needed to
stabilize cores embedded in molecular clouds with high average pressures. Since
the observed molecular linewidths of cores suggest that the turbulent pressure
is lower than the thermal pressure, magnetic field are likely a dominant
pressure component in many such cores.

curves of disk galaxies based on the assumption that the gas is a good tracer
of the gravitational potential of the galaxies. Some authors have suggested
that magnetic pinching forces could alter significantly the rotation curves of
spiral galaxies. In contrast to other studies which have concentrated in the
vertical structure of the disk, here we focus on the problem of magnetic
confinement in the radial direction to bound the magnetic effects on the HI
rotation curves. It is shown that azimuthal magnetic fields can hardly speed up
the HI disk of galaxies as a whole. In fact, based on virial constraints we
show that the contribution of galactic magnetic fields to the rotation curves
cannot be larger than ~10 km/s at the outermost point of HI detection, if the
galaxies did not contain dark matter at all, and up to 20 km/s in the
conventional dark halo scenario. The procedure to estimate the maximum effect
of magnetic fields is general and applicable to any particular galaxy disk. The
inclusion of the surface terms, namely the intergalactic (thermal, magnetic or
ram) pressure, does not change our conclusions. Other problems related with the
magnetic alternative to dark halos are highlighted. The relevance of magnetic
fields in the cuspy problem of dark halos is also discussed.

conclude both that the primary star (A) has a wide hollow cone of emission,
which is an expected characteristic of the relatively open magnetosphere given
its short spin period, and that A has a small angle between its spin and
magnetic dipole axes, $4\pm 3$ degrees. This near alignment of axes suggests
that A's wind pressure on B's magnetosphere will depend on orbital phase. This
variable pressure is one mechanism for the variation of flux and profile shape
of B with respect to the orbital phase that has been reported. The response of
B to the A wind pressure will also depend on the particular side of its
magnetosphere facing the wind at the spin phase when B is visible. This is a
second possible mechanism for variability. We suggest that B may have its spin
axis aligned with the orbital angular momentum owing to A's wind torque that
contributes to its spindown. Monitoring the pulsars while geodetic precession
changes spin orientations will provide essential evidence to test detailed
theoretical models. We determine the Rotation Measures of the two stars to be

feature as a function of the neutral hydrogen column density in symbiotic
stars.These two features are proposed to be formed via Raman scattering of UV
continuum around Ly$\beta$ and He II $\lambda$ 1025 emission line by neutral
hydrogen. The branching ratio of Raman scattering to Rayleigh scattering for UV
radiation around Ly$\beta$ is a non-linearly increasing function of the
wavelength, which results in enhanced Raman optical fluxes redward of the
H$\alpha$ line center as $N_{HI}$ increases. However, we find that the amount
of wing center shift is quite small about $20{\rm km s^{-1}}$ as $N_{HI}$
increases from $10^{20}{\rm cm^{-2}}$ to $10^{21}{\rm cm^{-2}}$. Assuming that
He II $\lambda$~1025 emission is characterized by a Gaussian profile, the Raman
scattered He II 6545 feature exhibits near Gaussian profiles with the peak
shifted redward for $N_{HI}<10^{22}{\rm cm^{-2}}$. The redward center shift
amounts to $1{\rm \AA}$ for $N_{HI}\sim 10^{20}{\rm cm^{-2}}$ and decreases as
$N_{HI}$ increases up to $N_{HI}\sim 10^{22}{\rm cm^{-2}}$, above which no
center shift is observed. The redward peak shift is due to the fact that the
incident emission profile is symmetric with respect to He II $\lambda$~1025
line center whereas the Raman conversion rate is increasing towards the line
center of Ly$\beta$. We emphasize that the determination of $N_{HI}$ by
locating the exact peak position of the He II 6545 feature will lift the
degeneracy to allow a more accurate estimate of the covering factor of the
neutral region, providing strong constraints on the mass loss process occurring
in symbiotic stars.

fixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on
local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are
almost independent of it. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is
specific star formation rate. For galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x
10^10 M_sun, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from low
to high densities. This decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. At fixed
stellar mass, twice as many galaxies host AGN with strong [OIII] emission in
low density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments
also contain more dust. We have analyzed correlations between spectroscopic
indicators that probe SFH on different timescales (D4000, Hdelta_A and SFR/M*).
The correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in
star formation has ocurred over long (>1 Gyr) timescales. Since structure does
not depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent SFH, dust
and AGN for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure,
e.g. mergers. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small scale (< 1
Mpc) estimates of local density. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity
between changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a
function of redshift and we interpret this using N-body simulations.

morphological appearance and dynamical evolution of the gas is primarily
determined by supersonic turbulence, and that stars form via a process we call
gravoturbulent fragmentation. Turbulence that is dominated by large-scale
shocks or is free to decay leads to an efficient, clustered, and synchronized
mode of star formation. On the other hand, when turbulence carries most of its
energy on very small scales star formation is inefficient and biased towards
single objects. The fact that Galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary
can be explained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. Some
filaments may accumulate sufficient mass and density to become gravitationally
unstable and form stars. This is observed in the Taurus molecular cloud.
Timescales and spatial distribution of protostars are well explained by the
linear theory of gravitational fragmentation of filaments. The dynamical
evolution, especially at late times, and the final mass distribution strongly
depend on the global properties of the turbulence. In dense embedded clusters
mutual protostellar interactions and competition for the available mass
reservoir lead to considerable stochastic variations between the mass growth
histories of individual stars.

late-time species N2H+. While all cores we have studied so far have R ratio
lower than 1, L1521E has an R value of 3.4, which is 8 times the mean of the

abundance profiles in L1521E using a density distribution derived from 1.2mm
continuum data. Our model shows that the C18O emission in this core is
consistent with constant abundance, and this makes L1521E the first core with
no C18O depletion. Our model also derives an unusually low N2H+ abundance.
These two chemical peculiarities suggest that L1521E has contracted to its

different from that of the intervening ones, indicating that the associated
systems are influenced by the strong UV flux from the QSO. There is a possible
correlation (anticorrelation) between [N/C] ([Si/C]) and [C/H] of the studied
associated systems, and [N/C] >= 0 when [C/H] >= 0. We have compared these

very good, in particular, the case envisaging massive haloes and high

the anticorrelation for [Si/C] vs. [C/H]. Narrow associated absorption systems
prove to be powerful tracers of the chemical abundances in gas belonging to

the QSO feedback, is probably going to contribute to the early enrichment of

driven superbubbles around the several hundred thousand galaxies that form in
an approximately spherical region of space with diameter 52 Mpc/h and mean
density close to the mean density of the Universe. We focus our attention on
the impact of winds on the diffuse intergalactic medium. Initial conditions for
mass loss at the base of winds are taken from Shu, Mo and Mao (2003). Results
are presented for the volume filling factor and the mass fraction of the IGM
affected by winds and their dependence on the model parameters is carefully
investigated. The mass loading efficiency of bubbles is a key factor to
determine the evolution of winds and their global impact on the IGM: the higher
the mass loading, the later the IGM is enriched with metals. Galaxies with 10^9

at z=3, while galaxies with M_* < 10^9 M_sun give a non negligible contribution
only at higher redshifts, when larger galaxies have not yet assembled. We find
a higher mean IGM metallicity than Lyalpha forest observations suggest and we
argue that the discrepancy may be explained by the high temperatures of a large
fraction of the metals in winds, which may not leave detectable imprints in
absorption in the Lyalpha forest.

but more exotic options cannot be excluded. Experimental searches are being
made for the 'dark' particles but we have indirect clues to their nature too.
Comparisons of data (from, eg, gravitational lensing) with numerical
simulations of galaxy formation can constrain (eg) the particle velocities and
collision cross sections.

be only about 30% of the critical density However, other recent evidence --
microwave background anisotropies, complemented by data on distant supernovae

two mysteries:

baryons, dark matter and dark energy -- in the proportions (roughly) 5%, 25%

charge-density wave, the inter-chain coupling is observed to favor either the
commensurate state or the incommensurate state depending on the initial
configuration; this gives rise to hysteresis around the
commensurate-incommensurate transition. Boundaries separating such phases with
different symmetries are obtained in the parameter space consisting of the
temperature, symmetry-breaking field, fluctuation strength, inter-chain
coupling, and misfit.

extended states that form when electrons, confined to two dimensions, are
subject to a perpendicular magnetic field. The effect involves exact
quantization of all the electronic transport properties due to particle
localization. In the conventional theory of the quantum Hall effect,
strong-field localization is associated with a single-particle drift motion of
electrons along contours of constant disorder potential. Transport experiments
that probe the extended states in the transition regions between quantum Hall
phases have been used to test both the theory and its implications for quantum
Hall phase transitions. Although several experiments on highly disordered
samples have affirmed the validity of the single-particle picture, other
experiments and some recent theories have found deviations from the predicted
universal behaviour. Here we use a scanning single-electron transistor to probe
the individual localized states, which we find to be strikingly different from
the predictions of single-particle theory. The states are mainly determined by
Coulomb interactions, and appear only when quantization of kinetic energy
limits the screening ability of electrons. We conclude that the quantum Hall
effect has a greater diversity of regimes and phase transitions than predicted
by the single-particle framework. Our experiments suggest a unified picture of
localization in which the single-particle model is valid only in the limit of
strong disorder.

in classical hydrodynamics. It marks the transition between the ""laminar"" and
turbulent regimes of vortex dynamics. The developed turbulence, described by a
Kolmogorov cascade, occurs when Re >> 1 in classical hydrodynamics. In

crossover or transition between two classes of superfluid turbulence: (i) the
classical regime, where the Kolmogorov cascade (probably modified by the
non-canonical dissipation due to mutual friction) is effective, vortices are
locally polarized, and the quantization of vorticity is not important; and (ii)
the Vinen quantum turbulence where the properties are determined by the

theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated
alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are
qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of
nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like
neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational
radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from
general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar
observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data
have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer
the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf
system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'',
solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545
is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects
for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The
presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA
space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect
for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used
securely for these ground interferometers.

of heavy fermions of one kind (including antiparticles) interacting with rather
light bosons of one kind. Fermion chemical potential is assumed to be small,
$\mu_f \lsim T$. Already for the low temperature, $T\ll {min} (T_{\rm bl.f},
m_{b})$, the fermion mass shell proves to be partially blurred due to multiple
fermion rescatterings on virtual bosons, $m_{b}$ is the boson mass, $T_{\rm
bl.f}$ $(\ll m_f)$ is the typical temperature corresponding to a complete
blurring of the gap between fermion-antifermion continua, $m_f$ is the fermion
mass. As the result, the ratio of the number of fermion-antifermion pairs to
the number provided by the ordinary Boltzmann distribution becomes larger than
unit ($R_N >1$). For $T\gsim m_{b}^* (T)$ (hot hadron liquid, blurred boson
continuum), $m_{b}^* (T)$ is the effective boson mass, the abundance of all
particles dramatically increases. The effective fermion mass $m_f^* (T)$
decreases with the temperature increase.
  For $T\gsim T_{\rm bl.f}$ fermions are essentially relativistic particles.
Due to the interaction of the boson with fermion-antifermion pairs, $m_{b}^*
(T)$ decreases leading to the possibility of the ``hot Bose condensation'' for
$T>T_{cb}$. The phase transition might be of the second order or of the first
order depending on the species under consideration.
  We estimate $R_N \sim 1.5$ for $T\sim m_{\pi}/2$; $T_{\rm bl.f}$ proves to be
near $T_{cb}$; both values are in the vicinity of the pion mass $m_{\pi}$.

originated in the VM. Further we match at a matching scale the axial-vector

explicit expressions for the wavefunctions in terms of time dependent and
independent Wigner functions. We show that the pure state quantum condition is
preserved by the Moyal (but not by the classical Liouville) time evolution and
is consistent with a generic stargenvalue equation. As a by-product Baker's
converse construction is generalized both to an arbitrary stargenvalue
equation, associated to a generic phase space symbol, as well as to the time
dependent case. These results are properly extended to the mixed state quantum
condition, which is proved to imply the Heisenberg uncertainty relations.
Globally, this formalism yields the complete characterization of the
kinematical structure of Wigner quantum mechanics. The previous results are
then succinctly generalized for various quasi-distributions. Finally, the
formalism is illustrated through the simple examples of the harmonic oscillator
and the free Gaussian wave packet. As a by-product, we obtain in the former

natural questions arise from Eyink's theory: (1) Existence of the enstrophy

harmonic oscillators coupled by springs, corresponding to a phonon model, we

be affected by the Doppler effect and fluctuations of the microwave field. The

  Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality","5 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.70.024303",,"quant-ph",,"  Maximally entangled states should maximally violate the Bell inequality. In
this paper, it is proved that all two-qubit states that maximally violate the
Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality are exactly Bell states and the
states obtained from them by local unitary transformations. The proof is
obtained by using the certain algebraic properties that Pauli's matrices
satisfy. The argument is extended to the three-qubit system. Since all states
obtained by local unitary transformations of a maximally entangled state are
equally valid entangled states, we thus give the characterizations of maximally
entangled states in both the two-qubit and three-qubit systems in terms of the
Bell inequality.

"quant-ph/0402008","Monica Dance","M. C. Dance","Real Observers and the Holographic Principle","LaTeX, 8 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The holographic principle asserts that the observable number of degrees of
freedom inside a volume is proportional not to the volume, but to the surface
area bounding the volume. There is currently a need to explain the principle in
terms of a more fundamental microscopic theory. This paper suggests a potential
explanation. This paper suggests that in general, for an observer to observe
the r coordinate of an event, the process of making that observation must
generate at least as much entropy as the information that the observation
gains. Following on from that, this paper sets out a simple argument that leads
to the result that observers on the surface of a sphere can observe an amount
of information about the enclosed system that is no more than an amount that is
proportional to the surface area of the sphere.

results of the cooling in dependence on size and location of the laser beam are
presented for the case of a non-degenerate vapour.

computer can be used to efficiently extract relevant physical information for
this model. It is possible to simulate the dynamical localization of classical
chaos and extract the localization length of the system with quadratic speed up
with respect to any known classical computation. We can also compute with
algebraic speed up the diffusion coefficient and the diffusion exponent both in
the regimes of Brownian and anomalous diffusion. Finally, we show that it is
possible to extract the fidelity of the quantum motion, which measures the
stability of the system under perturbations, with exponential speed up.

Theory. In a process, similar to the emergence of time in quantum cosmology,
time arises after an epistemic split of the unus mundus as a quality of the
individual conscious mind. Synchronization with matter and other mental systems
is achieved by entanglement correlations. In the course of its
operationalization, time loses its original quality of A-time and the B-time of
physics as measured by clocks will appear.
