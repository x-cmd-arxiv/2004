under the conditions for compact stars -$\beta$-equilibrium, charge and color
neutrality- is presented. Trapped antineutrinos prevent the formation of the
diquark condensate at moderate densities above a critical value of the
antineutrino chemical potential $\mu_{\bar \nu_e}^c$. The following
consequences are presented: 1) The star develops a 2-phase structure
($\mu_{\bar \nu_e}\geq \mu_{\bar \nu_e}^c$): a color superconducting QM core
and a normal QM shell. 2)During the cooling, when the temperature is small
enough ($T<1$ MeV) the antineutrino mean free path becomes larger than the
thickness of the normal QM shell and the antineutrinos get untrapped in a
sudden burst. The energy release is estimated as $\simeq 10^{52}$ erg and an
antineutrino pulse is expected to be observed.

using recently obtained U and B photometry of the NGC 5128 GC system, with
(U-B) used as the metallicity indicator. We test whether the observed MDF can
be reproduced using a single starburst at high redshift followed by passive
evolution (monolithic scenario). Our results strongly indicate that this
scenario is incapable of reproducing the observed MDF of the NGC 5128 GC
system. At least one more major starburst is required. A persistent feature of
our best-fit models is a strong GC formation episode in the first 1-2 Gyrs,
followed by a second formation episode typically after 10-12 Gyrs. Roughly
one-third of the stellar mass in the GC system is created in this late
starburst, producing clusters that are potentially less than 1 Gyr old.
Although we do not have adequate resolution in the model or in the observed MDF
to make a reliable claim about the possibility of additional GC formation
episodes, our results suggest that the GCs in this galaxy did not form solely
in a monolithic collapse and seem to support observational evidence which
indicates that NGC 5128 is a merger remnant.

spectroscopy of the host galaxy of GRB 031203. The host is an actively
star-forming galaxy at z=0.1055 +/- 0.0001. This is the lowest redshift GRB
to-date, aside from GRB 980425. From the hydrogen Balmer lines, we infer an
extinction of A_V = 3.62 +/- 0.25 or a total reddening E_T(B-V) = 1.17 +/- 0.1
toward the sightline to the nebular regions. After correcting for reddening, we
perform an emission-line analysis and derive an ISM temperature of
T=13400+/-2000K and electron density of n_e = 300 cm^(-3). These imply a
metallicity [O/H]=-0.72+/-0.15 dex and a roughly solar abundance pattern for N,
Ne, S, and Ar. Integrating Ha, we infer a dust-corrected star formation rate
(SFR) of > 11 Msol/yr. These observations have the following implications: (1)
the galaxy has a low K'-band luminosity L ~ L^*/5, typical of GRB host
galaxies; (2) the low redshift indicates GRB 031203 had an isotropic-equivalent
gamma-ray energy release smaller than all previous confirmed GRB events. The
burst discovery raises the likelihood of identifying many additional low z, low
flux events with Swift; (3) the large SFR, low metallicity, and the inferred

collapsar model; (4) several lines of evidence argue against the identification
of GRB 031203 as an X-ray flash event.

K-band observations, over imposed on the axisymmetric components in the plane
of the disk. The stellar study extends calculations from previous work
concerning the self-consistency of the pattern. The stellar response to the
imposed spiral mass is studied via computations of the central family of
periodic and nearby orbits as a function of the pattern rotation speed,
$\Omega_p$, among other parameters. A fine grid of values of $\Omega_p$ was
explored ranging from 12 to 25 $km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}$. Dynamical self-consistency
is highly sensitive to $\Omega_p$, with the best fit appearing at 20 $km s^{-1}
kpc^{-1}$. We give an account of recent independent pieces of theoretical and
observational work that are dependent on the value of $\Omega_p$, all of which
are consistent with the value found here; the recent star formation history of
the Milky Way, local inferences of cosmic ray flux variations and Galactic
abundance patterns. The gaseous response, which is also a function of
$\Omega_p$, was calculated via 2D hydrodynamic simulations with the ZEUS code.
For $\Omega_p = 20 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}$, the response to a two-armed pattern is
a structured pattern of 4 arms, with bifurcations along the arms and interarm
features. The pattern resembles qualitatively the optical arms observed in our
Galaxy and other galaxies. The complex gaseous pattern appears to be linked to
resonances in stellar orbits. Among these, the 4:1 resonance plays an important
role, as it also determines the extent over which the imposed spiral pattern is
dynamically self-consistent.

around Sgr A* during 625 ks of Chandra observations. The spectrum exhibits
He-like and H-like lines from Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe, that are consistent with
originating in a two-temperature plasma, as well as a prominent low-ionization
Fe line. The cooler, kT=0.8 keV plasma differs in surface brightness across the
image by a factor of 9. This soft plasma is probably heated by supernovae. The
radiative cooling rate of the plasma within the inner 20 pc of the Galaxy could
be balanced by 1% of the kinetic energy of one supernova every 300,000 y. The
hotter, kT=8 keV component is more spatially uniform, ranging over a factor of
2 in surface brightness. The intensity of the hard plasma is correlated with
that of the soft, but they are probably only indirectly related, because
supernova remnants are not observed to produce thermal plasma hotter than kT=3
keV. Moreover, a kT=8 keV plasma is too hot to be bound to the Galactic center,
and therefore would form a slow wind or fountain of plasma. The energy required
to sustain such a freely-expanding plasma within the inner 20 pc of the Galaxy
is ~10^40 erg/s, which corresponds to the entire kinetic energy of one
supernova every 3000 y. This rate is unreasonably high. However, alternative
explanations for the kT=8 keV diffuse emission are equally unsatisfying. We are
left to conclude that either the diffuse emission is heated by an unanticipated
source of energy, or that a population of faint (< 10^31 erg/s), hard X-ray
sources that are a factor of 10 more numerous than CVs remains to be
discovered. (Abridged)

magnetic field into account. Furthermore, we also consider that instead of
taking the gap size at half of the light cylinder radius to represent the
entire outer gap it is more appropriate to average the entire outer gap size
over the distance. When these two factors are considered, the derived outer gap
size f is not only the function of period P and magnetic field B of the neutron
star, but also the function of the average radial distance to the neutron star
<r>. We use this new outer gap model to study $\gamma$-ray luminosity of
pulsars, and to study the death lines of $\gamma$-ray emission of the pulsars.
Our model can predict the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of individual pulsar if its
$P, B$ and $\alpha$ are known. Since different pulsars have different $\alpha$,
this explains why some $\gamma$-ray pulsars have very similar $P$ and $B$ but
have very different $\gamma$-ray luminosities. In determining the death line of
$\gamma$-ray pulsars, we have used a new criterion based on concrete physical
reason. In estimate of the fractional size of the outer gap, two possible X-ray
fields are considered: (i) X-rays are produced by the neutron star cooling and
polar cap heating, and (ii)X-rays are produced by the bombardment of the
relativistic particles from the outer gap on the stellar surface. Since it is
very difficult to measure $\alpha$ in general, we use a Monte Carlo method to
simulate the properties of $\gamma$-ray pulsars in our galaxy. We find that
this new outer gap model predicts many more weak $\gamma$-ray pulsars. For all
simulated $\gamma$-ray pulsars with self-sustained outer gaps, $\gamma$-ray
luminosity $L_{\gamma}$ satisfies $L_{\gamma}\propto L^{\delta}_{sd}$; where
the value of $\delta$ depends on the ensitivity of the $\gamma$-ray detector.

of the galactic BCO mass distribution to simulate the physical distribution of
binaries in the nearby universe. We use Monte Carlo methods to determine the
fraction of binaries observable by the LIGO detectors from each galaxy as a
function of the BCO chirp mass. We examine separately the role of source
distance, sky position, time of detection, and binary system chirp mass on
detection efficiency and selection effects relevant to the three LIGO

that strong absorption in the X-ray spectra of QSOs at high-redshifts may

associated with them. For example the phase of a complex field depending on two
variables can either increase or decrease on making a clockwise circuit around
a simple zero, enabling the zeros to be assigned charges of plus or minus one.
In random fields we can define a correlation function for the charge-weighted
density of singularities. In many types of random fields, this correlation
function satisfies an identity which shows that the singularities 'screen' each
other perfectly: a positive singularity is surrounded by an excess of
concentration of negatives which exactly cancel its charge, and vice-versa.

model in the presence of an exchange splitting which follows either regular or
inverted Hund's rules. The phase diagram contains a non-Fermi liquid fixed
point separating a screened phase, where conventional Kondo effect occurs, from
an unscreened one, where the exchange-splitting takes care of quenching the
impurity degrees of freedom. On the Kondo screened side close to this fixed
point the impurity density of states shows a narrow Kondo-peak on top of a
broader resonance. This narrow peak transforms in the unscreened phase into a
narrow pseudo-gap inside the broad resonance. Right at the fixed point only the
latter survives. The fixed point is therefore identified by a jump of the
density of states at the chemical potential. We also show that particle-hole
perturbations which simply shift the orbital energies do not wash out the fixed
point, unlike those perturbations which hybridize the two orbitals.
Consequently the density-of-state jump at the chemical potential remains finite
even away from particle-hole symmetry, and the pseudo-gap stays pinned at the
chemical potential, although it is partially filled in. We also discuss the
relevance of these results for lattice models which map onto this Anderson
impurity model in the limit of large lattice-coordination. Upon approaching the
Mott metal-insulator transition, these lattice models necessarily enter a
region with a local criticality which reflects the impurity non-Fermi liquid
fixed point. However, unlike the impurity, the lattice can get rid of the
single-impurity fixed-point instability by spontaneously developing
bulk-coherent symmetry-broken phases, which we identify for different lattice
models.

characterized by the systematic change of the $xy$ orbital occupation. For the
AF side ($x < 0.2$), we present firm evidence for the $xy$ ferro-orbital
ordering. It is found that the degeneracy of $t_{2g}$ (or $e_g$) states is
lifted robustly due to the two-dimensional (2D) crystal-structure, even without
the Jahn-Teller distortion of RuO$_6$. This effect dominates, and the
cooperative occupation of $xy$ orbital is concluded. In contrast to recent
proposals, the resulting electronic structure explains well both the observed
X-ray absorption spectra and the double peak structure of optical conductivity.
For the FM side ($x=0.5$), however, the $xy$ orbital with half filling opens a
pseudo-gap in the FM state and contributes to the spin $S$=1/2 moment (rather
than $S$=1 for $x$=0.0 case) dominantly, while $yz,zx$ states are itinerant
with very small spin polarization, explaining the recent neutron data
consistently.

(advance of perihelion, gravitational refraction, gravitational red shift, echo
delay of sun-grazing radio signals, and others). The equations of motion,
properly stated, are also seen to be identical to those of electromagnetism and
lead to the correct prediction of gravitational radiation. Therefore Milne's
kinematic model of the universe, mappable into his dynamical (or Newtonian)

there is a universal character in the noncommutative correction to the magnetic

that the analysis is not complete as it brings in to fore the ambiguities in

for example, each bond $\{x,y\}$ is occupied with probability $p D(y-x)$. The
above models are known to exhibit a phase transition when the parameter $p$
varies around a model-dependent critical point $\pc$. We investigate the value
of $\pc$ when $d>6$ for percolation and $d>4$ for the other models, and
$L\gg1$. We prove in a unified way that $\pc=1+C(D)+O(L^{-2d})$, where the
universal term 1 is the mean-field critical value, and the model-dependent term
$C(D)=O(L^{-d})$ is written explicitly in terms of the function $D$. Our proof
is based on the lace expansion for each of these models.

face-to-face by translations is affinely equivalent to the Dirichlet-Voronoi
polytope of some lattice. In 1999 Erdahl proved this conjecture for the special
case of zonotopes. A zonotope is a projection of a regular cube under some
affine transformation. In 1975 McMullen showed several equivalent conditions
for a zonotope to be a space tiling zonotope, i.e. a zonotope which admits a
face-to-face tiling of space by translations. Implicitly, he related space
tiling zonotopes to a special class of oriented matroids (regular matroids). We
will extend his result to give a new proof of Voronoi's conjecture for
zonotopes using oriented matroids. This enables us to distinguish between
combinatorial and metrical properties and to apply the fact that oriented
matroids considered here have an essentially unique realization. Originally,
this is a theorem due to Brylawski and Lucas. By using oriented matroid duality
we interpret a part of McMullen's arguments as an elegant geometric proof of
this theorem in the special case of real numbers.

provides a good approximation to the full relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB)
description of the ground state properties of the drip-line neutron rich
nuclei. The applicability of RMF+BCS is essentially due to the fact that the
main contribution to the pairing correlations is provided by the low-lying
resonant states. General validity of this approach is demonstrated by the
detailed calculations for the ground state properties of the chains of isotopes
of O, Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn and Pb nuclei. The TMA and NL-SH force parameter sets have
been used for the effective mean-field Lagrangian. Comprehensive results for
the two neutron separation energy, rms radii, single particle pairing gaps and
pairing energies etc. are presented. The Ca isotopes are found to exhibit
distinct features near the neutron drip line whereby it is found that further
addition of neutrons causes a rapid increase in the neutron rms radius with
almost no increase in the binding energy, indicating the occurrence of halos. A
comparison of these results with the available experimental data and with the
recent continuum relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) calculations amply
demonstrates the validity and usefulness of this fast RMF+BCS approach.

a two-grid tube is used as a combination of electron gun, equipotential
collision space, and detection cell, was analyzed recently in considerable
detail. In particular, it was inferred that, at optimal pressure, the formation
of peaks in the anode current at inelastic thresholds is mediated inside the
detection cell by the large variation, a maximum at 0.4 eV, in the cross
section for elastic scattering. This variation is due to a shape resonance in
the electron-mercury system and is observable persuasively at the onset of
anode current as a sharp peak followed by a clear minimum. In the present
paper, the passage of electrons through the second grid to anode region is
analyzed in terms of kinetic theory. The discussion is based on a simplified
expression for the electron current derivable from an approximate form of the
Boltzmann transport equation that maintains the spatial density gradient but
omits elastic energy losses. The estimated range of pressure underlying this
kind of idealization is in good agreement with experiment. An explicit solution
is obtained by constructing an analytic expression for the momentum transfer
cross section of mercury using a recent theory of generalized Fano profiles for
overlapping resonances. This solution is used in order to model successfully
the formation of peaks at the threshold of anode current and at excitation
potentials, and to explain the dependence of the observed profiles on the
pressure and on the sign and magnitude of the potential across the detection
cell.

which allows one to properly separate the complex amplitude and the phase of
the wave solution. Appling this modification to a smoothly inhomogeneous
isotropic medium, we show that in the first geometrical optics approximation
the medium is weakly anisotropic. The refractive index, being dependent on the
direction of the wave vector, contains the correction, which is proportional to
the Berry geometric phase. Two independent eigenmodes of right-hand and
left-hand circular polarizations exist in the medium. Their group velocities
and phase velocities differ. The difference in the group velocities results in
the shift of the rays of different polarizations (the optical Magnus effect).
The difference in the phase velocities causes the increase of Berry phase along
with the interference of two modes leading to the familiar Rytov law about the
rotation of the polarization plane of a wave. The theory developed suggests
that both the optical Magnus effect and the Berry phase are accompanying
nonlocal topological effects. In this paper the Hamilton ray equations giving a
unified description for both of these phenomena have been derived and also a
novel splitting effect for a ray of noncircular polarization has been
predicted. Specific examples are also discussed.

experiments using air and gaseous helium at cryogenic temperatures, and obtain
the intermittency exponent via the two-point correlation function of the energy
dissipation. The air data are obtained in a number of flows in a wind tunnel
and the atmospheric boundary layer at a height of about 35 m above the ground.
The helium data correspond to the centerline of a jet exhausting into a
container. The air data on the intermittency exponent are consistent with each
other and with a trend that increases with the Taylor microscale Reynolds
number, R_\lambda, of up to about 1000 and saturates thereafter. On the other
hand, the helium data cluster around a constant value at nearly all R_\lambda,
this being about half of the asymptotic value for the air data. Some possible
explanation is offered for this anomaly.

with energy transfer. We attribute this slow component to emission by isolated
intrachain excitons with reduced nonradiative relaxation.

  issue",,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.PE",,"  The neutral mutation rate is known to vary widely along human chromosomes,
leading to mutational hot and cold regions. We provide evidence that categories
of functionally-related genes reside preferentially in mutationally hot or cold
regions, the size of which we have measured. Genes in hot regions are biased
toward extra-cellular communication (surface receptors, cell adhesion, immune
response, etc.) while those in cold regions are biased toward essential
cellular processes (gene regulation, RNA processing, protein modification,
etc.). From a selective perspective, this organization of genes could minimize
the mutational load on genes that need to be conserved and allow fast evolution
for genes that must frequently adapt. We also analyze the effect of gene
duplication and chromosomal recombination, which contribute significantly to
these biases for certain categories of hot genes. Overall, our results show
that genes are located non-randomly with respect to hot and cold regions,
offering the possibility that selection acts at the level of gene location in
the human genome.

coupling between a broadening atom(molecule) and the electromagnetic fields
exists in a dielectric sphere cavity whether the sphere is small or big. From

apply this expression to a real experiment and obtain a consistent result with

correction is accurate, and reveal that the local-field correction factor can
be measured precisely and easily by fluorescence experiments of surfactant
molecules. Moreover, the spontaneous decay of a surfactant molecular on

fluorescence experiment in a micro-sphere cavity can be used to estimate the
radiative broadening.

in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with the coupling laser being
much stronger than the probe laser. In this case, the upper and intermediate
levels are unpopulated, so that their adiabatic elimination enables an
effective two-mode model involving only the atomic field at the lowest internal
level and the quantized probe laser field. Atom-photon quantum entanglement is
created through laser-atom and inter-atomic interactions, and two-photon
detuning. We show how to generate atom-photon entangled coherent states and
entangled states between photon (atom) coherent states and atom-(photon-)
macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS) states, and between photon-MQS and
