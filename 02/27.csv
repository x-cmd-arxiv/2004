by broad and asymmetric Balmer lines. The obscuring matter is constrained to be
located within the radio hotspots, in turn separated by about 10 pc. If the

nuclear continuum electron scattering, or inverse Compton of the - remarkably

localized, multiple, small-scale dissipation regions inside an evolving,
turbulent active region. The dissipation regions are Unstable Current Sheets
(UCS), and in their ensemble they form a complex, fractal, evolving network of
acceleration centers. Acceleration and energy dissipation are thus assumed to
be fragmented. A large-scale magnetic topology provides the connectivity
between the UCS and determines in this way the degree of possible multiple
acceleration. The particles travel along the magnetic field freely without
loosing or gaining energy, till they reach a UCS. In a UCS, a variety of
acceleration mechanisms are active, with the end-result that the particles
depart with a new momentum. The stochastic acceleration process is represented
in the form of Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW), which allows to estimate the
evolution of the energy distribution of the particles. It is found that under
certain conditions electrons are heated and accelerated to energies above 1 MeV
in much less than a second. Hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave spectra are
calculated from the electrons' energy distributions, and they are found to be
compatible with the observations. Ions (protons) are also heated and
accelerated, reaching energies up to 10 MeV almost simultaneously with the
electrons. The diffusion of the particles inside the active region is extremely
fast (anomalous super-diffusion). Although our approach does not provide
insight into the details of the specific acceleration mechanisms involved, its
benefits are that it relates acceleration to the energy release, and it well
describes the stochastic nature of the acceleration process.

in explaining the spatial profiles of the radio, optical, and X-ray knots in
sources such as PKS 0637-752, 3C 273, or PKS 1127-145. These difficulties can
be resolved in the framework of one- and two-component synchrotron models. We
propose a model where the broad band radio to X-ray synchrotron emission in
quasar jets is powered by collimated beams of ultra-high energy neutrons and
gamma-rays formed in the sub-parsec scale jets. The decay of the neutral beam
in the intergalactic medium drives relativistic shocks to accelerate nonthermal
electrons out of the ambient medium. A second synchrotron component arises from
the injection of leptons with Lorentz factors $\gg 10^7$ that appear in the
extended jet in the process of decay of ultra-high energy gamma rays. This
approach could account for qualitative differences in the extended X-ray jets
of FR1 and FR2 galaxies. Detection of high-energy neutrinos from blazars and

This may be a relic of early galaxy formation, caused by the disk coalescing
out of a smaller, denser halo (e.g., higher concentration index) or by
truncation of the hot gas envelope due to the enhanced local density of
neighbors, though we cannot completely rule out the effect of the gas stripping
process. The spatial extent of H-alpha flux and the B-band radius also
decreases, but only in early type spirals, suggesting that gas removal is less
efficient within steeper potential wells (or that stripped late type spirals
are quickly rendered unrecognizable). We find no significant trend in stellar
mass-to-light ratios or circular velocities with HI gas content, morphological
type, or clustercentric radius, for star forming spiral galaxies throughout the

reddening in its infrared-ultraviolet continuum and previous observations had
shown no evidence for ionized absorption in either the ultraviolet or X-ray
bands. The new XMM-Newton RGS data place tight limits on the presence of an
ionized X-ray absorber and confirm that the X-ray spectrum of Ark 120 is
essentially unmodified by intervening matter. Thus Ark 120 can be considered a
`bare' Seyfert 1 nucleus. This observation therefore offers a clean view of the
X-ray spectrum of a `normal' Seyfert galaxy free from absorption effects. The
spectrum shows a Doppler broadened iron emission line (FWHM ~ 3*10^4 km/s) and
a smooth, continuous soft excess which appears to peak at an energy ~0.5 keV.
This adds weight to the claim that genuine soft excesses (i.e. those due to a
real steepening of the underlying continuum below ~2 keV) are ubiquitous in
Seyfert 1 spectra. However, the detailed shape of the excess could not be
reproduced by any of the simple models tested (power-laws, blackbodies,
Comptonised blackbodies, accretion disc reflection). This observation therefore
demonstrates both the need to understand the soft excess (as a significant
contributor to the luminosity of most Seyfert 1s) and the inability of the

distribution is subject to random gravitational lensing, or scattering, causing
variations in the wave amplitude and temporal smearing of the signal. A
statistical theory is constructed to treat these effects. The statistical
properties of the wave amplitude variations are a direct probe of the power
spectrum of the mass distribution through which the waves propagate. Scattering
temporally smears any intensity variations intrinsic to a source emitting
gravitational radiation, rendering variability on time scales shorter than the
temporal smearing time scale unobservable, and potentially making the radiation
much harder to detect. Gravitational radiation must propagate out through the
mass distribution of its host galaxy before it can be detected at the Earth.
Plausible models for the distribution of matter in an $L_*$ host galaxy suggest
that the temporal smearing time scale is at least several milliseconds due to
the gas content alone, and may be as large as a second if dark matter also
scatters the radiation. The smearing time due to scattering by any galaxy
interposed along the line of sight is a factor $\sim 10^5$ times larger.
Gravitational scattering is an excellent probe of matter on parsec and
sub-parsec scales, and has the potential to elucidate the nature of dark

exceeding by a factor ~ 7 the expected value for X-ray emission from single

spectra are fitted consistently with a two temperature mekal optically thin
thermal plasma model, with temperatures ranging from ~ 2 to 6 10^6 K. At first
sight, these rather low temperatures are consistent with the expectations for a
close binary system where the winds collide well before reaching their terminal

we conclude that if hydrodynamical instabilities exist in the wind interaction
region of HD159176, they are not sufficient to produce an observable signature
in the X-ray emission. Hydrodynamic simulations using wind parameters from the
literature reveal some puzzling discrepancies. The most striking one concerns
the predicted X-ray luminosity which is one or more orders of magnitude larger
than the observed one. A significant reduction of the mass loss rate of the
components compared to the values quoted in the literature alleviates the
discrepancy but is not sufficient to fully account for the observed luminosity.

multiple star systems is not large, some differences between the orbital
parameters and the masses of these planets and the ones of planets orbiting
single stars are emerging in the mass-period and in the eccentricity-period
diagrams. As pointed out by Zucker & Mazeh (2002), the most massive
short-period planets are all found in multiple star systems. We show here that
the planets orbiting in multiple star systems also tend to have a very low
eccentricity when their period is shorter than about 40 days. These
observations seem to indicate that some kind of migration has been at work in
the history of these systems. The properties of the five short-period planets
orbiting in multiple star systems seem, however, difficult to explain with the
current models of planet formation and evolution, at least if we want to invoke
a single mechanism to account for all the characteristics of these planets.

interactions or inhomogeneous magnetic fields, we introduce the spin density
operator associated with such current expressed in terms of the spin-resolved

complete description of coupled spin-charge quantum transport in open

analyze particular routes that diminish spin coherence (signified by decay of

force network form. The approach to steady state behavior depends on the
history of the packing and the existing force and contact network. We present
experiments on shearing of dense granular matter in a 2D Couette geometry in
which we probe the history and evolution of shear bands by measuring particle
trajectories and stresses during transients. We find that when shearing is
stopped and restarted in the same direction, steady state behavior is
immediately reached, in agreement with the typical assumption that the system
is quasistatic. Although some relaxation of the force network is observed when
shearing is stopped, quasistatic behavior is maintained because the contact
network remains essentially unchanged. When the direction of shear is reversed,
a transient occurs in which stresses initially decrease, changes in the force
network reach further into the bulk, and particles far from the wheel become
more mobile. This occurs because the force network is fragile to changes
transverse to the force network established under previous shear; particles
must rearrange before becoming jammed again, thereby providing resistance to
shear in the reversed direction. The strong force network is reestablished
after displacing the shearing surface $\approx 3d$, where $d$ is the mean grain
diameter. Steady state velocity profiles are reached after a shear of $\leq
30d$. Particles immediately outside of the shear band move on average less than
1 diameter before becoming jammed again. We also examine particle rotation
during this transient and find that mean particle spin decreases during the
transient, which is related to the fact that grains are not interlocked as
strongly.

among facilitated and unfacilitated regions give rise to new relaxation

proposed model that gives an explanation of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration
$a_{\rm P}$. The model is based on an idea already discovered by Einstein in
1907: the light speed depends on the gravitational potential $\Phi$, so that it
is larger the higher if $\Phi$. The potential due to all the mass and energy in
the universe increases in time because of its expansion, which has the
consequence that light must be slowly accelerating. Moreover it turns out that
the observational effects of a universal adiabatic acceleration of light
$a_\ell =a_{\rm P}$ and of an extra acceleration towards the
  Sun $a_{\rm P}$ of a spaceship would be the same: a blue shift increasing
linearly in time, precisely what was observed. The phenomenon would be due to a
cosmological acceleration of the proper time of bodies with respect to the

provide many advantages. There are many variants of these fat link actions in
lattice QCD currently, such as FLIC fermions. Frequently, fat link actions make
use of the APE blocking technique in combination with a projection of the
blocked links back into the special unitary group. This reunitarisation is
often performed using an iterative maximisation of a gauge invariant measure.
This technique is not differentiable with respect to the gauge field and thus
prevents the use of standard Hybrid Monte Carlo simulation algorithms. The use
of an alternative projection technique circumvents this difficulty and allows
the simulation of dynamical fat link fermions with standard HMC and its
variants.

hybrid inflation does not last long enough to reproduce the central value of
observation, we invoke new inflation after the first inflation. Its initial
condition is set dynamically during smooth hybrid inflation and the spectrum of

early star formation as found by WMAP. Hence two new features of WMAP

This class of systems includes mechanical systems subject to holonomic and

systems evolving on semidirect products. We introduce the notions of linear
connection, symmetric product and geodesically invariant subbundle on a Lie
algebroid. We present appropriate tests for various notions of accessibility

  Modulo 5 and Generalizations","24 pages, 2figures. This paper is greatly expanded version of an
  earlier paper which appeared as arXiv:math.CO/0401012",,,,"math.CO math.NT",,"  In a recent study of sign-balanced, labelled posets Stanley, introduced a new
integral partition statistic srank(pi) = O(pi) - O(pi'), where O(pi) denotes
the number of odd parts of the partition pi and pi' is the conjugate of pi.
Andrews proved the following refinement of Ramanujan's partition congruence mod
5: p[0](5n +4) = p[2](5n + 4) = 0 (mod 5), p(n) = p[0](n) + p[2](n), where
p[i](n) (i = 0; 2) denotes the number of partitions of n with srank = i (mod 4)
and p(n) is the number of unrestricted partitions of n. Andrews asked for a
partition statistic that would divide the partitions enumerated by p[i](5n + 4)
(i = 0, 2) into five equinumerous classes. In this paper we discuss three such
statistics: the St-crank, the 2-quotient-rank and the 5-core-crank. The first
one, while new, is intimately related to the Andrews-Garvan crank. The second
one is in terms of the 2-quotient of a partition. The third one was introduced
by Garvan, Kim and Stanton. We use it in our combinatorial proof of the Andrews
refinement. Remarkably, the Andrews result is a simple consequence of a
stronger refinement of Ramanujan's congruence mod 5. This more general
refinement uses a new partition statistic which we term the BG-rank. We employ
the BG-rank to prove new partition congruences modulo 5. Finally, we discuss
some new formulas for partitions that are 5-cores and discuss an intriguing
relation between 3-cores and the Andrews-Garvan crank.

multiplicative, and exponential formulas in the (initial) Cockett-Seely
polarized game logic is discussed. The complexity is ultimately based on the
complexity of finding a strategy in a formula which is, for polarized additive
formulas, in the worst case linear in their size. Having a proof of a sequent
is equivalent to having a strategy for the internal-hom object. In order to
show that the internal-hom object can have size exponentially larger than the
formulas of the original sequent we develop techniques for calculating the size
of the multiplicative formulas.
  The structure of the internal hom object can be exploited and, using dynamic
programming techniques, one can reduce the cost of finding a strategy in such a
formula to the order of the product of the sizes of the original formulas. The
use of dynamic techniques motivates the consideration of games as acyclic
graphs and we show how to calculate the size of these graph games for the
multiplicative and additive fragment and, thus, the cost of determining their
provability using this dynamic programming approach.
  The final section of the paper points out that, despite the apparent
complexity of the formulas, there is, for the initial polarized logic with all
the connectives (additives, multiplicatives, and exponentials) a way of
determining provability which is \emph{linear} in the size of the formulas.

($\rho,\omega,\phi$) is described via the excitation of nucleon resonances
($R$). The theoretical framework is an extended vector meson dominance model
(eVMD) for resonance decays $R\longmapsto NV$ with arbitrary spin which is
covariant and kinematically complete. The eVMD includes thereby excited vector
meson states in the transition form factors. The model has successfully been
applied to $\omega$ and $\phi$ production in $p+p$ reactions. The same model is
used to describe the dilepton production in elementary reactions where
corresponding data are well reproduced. However, when the model is applied to
heavy ion reactions in the BEVALAC/SIS energy range the experimental dilepton
spectra measured by the DLS Collaboration are significantly underestimated at
small invariant masses. In view of this fact we discuss further medium effects:
One is a substantial collisional broadening of the $\rho$ and in particular of
the $\omega$ meson in the vicinity of the $\rho/\omega$-peak. The second medium
effect is the destruction of quantum interference in a dense medium. A
decoherent dilepton emission through vector mesons decays enhances the
corresponding low mass dilepton yield in heavy ion reactions and improves the
agreement with existing data.

which takes the finite curvature of the potential field into account. The
transport coefficients of our theory satisfy the well-known
fluctuation-dissipation theorem in the limit of Markovian approximation in the

diffusion along a potential barrier, the diffusion coefficient can be related
to the friction coefficient by an analytic continuation of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the case of diffusion along a potential
well in the asymptotic time, but contains strong non-Markovian effects at short
times. By applying our theory to the case of realistic values of the
temperature, the barrier curvature, and the friction coefficient, we show that
the quantum effects will play significant roles in describing the synthesis of
superheavy elements, i.e., the evolution from the fusion barrier to the
conditional saddle, in terms of a diffusion process. We especially point out
the importance of the memory effect, which increases at lower temperatures. It
makes the net quantum effects enhance the probability of crossing the

falls freely under gravity, it forms a long slender thread, which can be
maintained in a stable, stationary state with lengths up to several meters. We
shall discuss the shape of such liquid threads and their surprising stability.
It turns out that the strong advection of the falling fluid can almost outrun
the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Even for a very viscous fluid like sirup or
silicone oil, the asymptotic shape and stability is independent of viscosity
and small perturbations grow with time as $\exp({{\rm C} t^{{1/4}}})$, where
the constant is independent of viscosity. The corresponding spatial growth has
the form $\exp({(z/L)^{{1/8}}})$, where $z$ is the down stream distance and $L
\sim Q^2 \sigma^{-2} g$ and where $\sigma$ is the surface tension, $g$ is the
gravity and $Q$ is the flux. However, the value of viscosity determines the
break-up length of a thread $L_{\nu} \sim \nu^{1/4}$ and thus the possibility
of observing the $\exp({{\rm C} t^{{1/4}}})$ type asymptotics.

equations for an arbitrary gene network. We consider a genome consisting of $ N
$ genes, so that each gene sequence $ \sigma $ may be written as $ \sigma =
\sigma_1 \sigma_2 ... \sigma_N $. We assume a single fitness peak (SFP) model
for each gene, so that gene $ i $ has some ``master'' sequence $ \sigma_{i, 0}
$ for which it is functioning. The fitness landscape is then determined by
which genes in the genome are functioning, and which are not. The equilibrium
behavior of this model may be solved in the limit of infinite sequence length.
The central result is that, instead of a single error catastrophe, the model
exhibits a series of localization to delocalization transitions, which we term
an ``error cascade.'' As the mutation rate is increased, the selective
advantage for maintaining functional copies of certain genes in the network
disappears, and the population distribution delocalizes over the corresponding
sequence spaces. The network goes through a series of such transitions, as more
and more genes become inactivated, until eventually delocalization occurs over
the entire genome space, resulting in a final error catastrophe. This model
provides a criterion for determining the conditions under which certain genes
in a genome will lose functionality due to genetic drift. It also provides
insight into the response of gene networks to mutagens. In particular, it
suggests an approach for determining the relative importance of various genes
to the fitness of an organism, in a more accurate manner than the standard
``deletion set'' method. The results in this paper also have implications for
mutational robustness and what C.O. Wilke termed ``survival of the flattest.''
