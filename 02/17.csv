have detected particles beyond the GZK energy limit. In the second part of the

provide a brief summary of scenarios which try to explain the super-GZK events

give an overview on neutrino telescopes and existing limits on the energy

  A comparison with HST STIS optical (0.2 to 1.1 micron) images shows that the
orientation of the circumstellar nebulosity in the near-IR extends from PAs 210
to 270 degrees in H and K bands and up to 300 degrees in the J band. We call
the circumstellar nebulosity seen between 210 to 270 degrees as 'IR
nebulosity'. We find that the IR nebulosity (which extends up to 3.5 arcsecs in
J band and 2.5 arcsecs in the K band) is due to scattered light from the
central star. The IR nebulosity is either a cavity formed by the stellar
outflows or part of the circumstellar disk. We present a schematic
3-dimensional geometrical model of the disk and jet of SU Aur based on STIS and
our near-IR observations. According to this model the IR nebulosity is a part

luminosity range that is key to linking the most luminous infrared galaxies
with the population of galaxies at large. We have obtained photometry for all
of these VLIRG systems, the individual galaxies (when detached), and their
nuclei, and the relative behavior of these classes has been studied in optical
color-magnitude diagrams. The photometric properties of the sample are also
compared with previously studied samples of ULIRGs. The mean observed
photometric properties of VLIRG and ULIRG samples, considered as a whole, are
indistinguishable at optical wavelengths. This suggests that not only ULIRG,
but also the more numerous population of VLIRGs, have similar rest-frame
optical photometric properties as the submillimeter galaxies (SMG), reinforcing
the connection between low-{\it z} LIRGs -- high-{\it z} SMGs. When the nuclei
of the {\it young} and {\it old} interacting systems are considered separately,
some differences between the VLIRG and the ULIRG samples are found. In
particular, the old VLIRGs are less luminous and redder than old ULIRG systems.
If confirmed with larger samples, this behavior suggests that the late-stage
evolution is different for VLIRGs and ULIRGs. Specifically, as suggested from
spectroscopic data, the present photometric observations support the idea that
the activity during the late phases of VLIRG evolution is dominated by
starbursts, while a higher proportion of ULIRGs could evolve into a QSO type of
object.

Jeans equation modeling or adopted from dynamical models in the literature. In
stellar mass-to-light ratios the spheroids and bulges span a range of a factor
of eight. The bulge masses were related to well-determined black hole masses
taken from the literature. With these improved values for M_bh, compared to
Magorrian et al. (1998), and our redetermination of M_bulge, we find the
M_bh-M_bulge relation becomes very tight. We find M_bh ~ M_bulge^(1.12+/-0.06)
with an observed scatter of < 0.30 dex, a fraction of which can be attributed
to measurement errors. The scatter in this relation is therefore comparable to
the scatter in the relations of M_bh with sigma and the stellar concentration.

the extreme, high-pressure environments induced by galaxy encounters, mostly

suggests that star CLUSTER formation is an important and perhaps even the
dominant mode of star formation in the starburst events associated with galaxy
interactions. The production of young massive star clusters (YSCs) seems to be
a hallmark of intense star formation, particularly in interacting and starburst
galaxies. Their sizes, luminosities, and mass estimates are entirely consistent
with what is expected for young Milky Way-type globular clusters (GCs). YSCs
are important because of what they can tell us about GC formation and evolution
(e.g., initial characteristics and early survival rates). They are also of
prime importance as probes of the formation and (chemical) evolution of their
host galaxies, and of the initial mass function in the extreme environments
required for cluster formation. Recent evidence lends support to the scenario
that Milky Way-type GCs (although more metal rich), which were once thought to
be the oldest building blocks of galaxies, are still forming today.

that the properties of these bursts are similar to those of Soft
Gamma-Repeaters (SGRs). The similarities we find are: the burst durations
follow a log-normal distribution which peaks at 99 ms, the differential burst
fluence distribution is well described by a power law of index -1.7, the burst
fluences are positively correlated with the burst durations, the distribution
of waiting times is well described by a log-normal distribution of mean 47 s,
and the bursts are generally asymmetric with faster rise than fall times.
However, we find several quantitative differences between the AXP and SGR
bursts. Specifically, there is a correlation of burst phase with pulsed
intensity, the AXP bursts we observed exhibit a wider range of durations, the
correlation between burst fluence and duration is flatter than for SGRs, the
observed AXP bursts are on average less energetic than observed SGR bursts, and
the more energetic AXP bursts have the hardest spectra - the opposite of what
is seen for SGRs. We conclude that the bursts are sufficiently similar that
AXPs and SGRs can be considered united as a source class yet there are some
interesting differences that may help determine what physically differentiates
the two closely related manifestations of neutron stars.

GX 339-4 underwent 15 outbursts and went through all known states of black-hole
binaries. We also present the PCA data from the initial stage of the 2004
outburst. We then study colour-colour and colour-flux correlations. In the hard
state, there is a strong anticorrelation between the 1.5-5 and 3-12 keV
spectral slopes, which we explain by thermal Comptonization of disc photons.
There is also a softening of the spectrum above 3 keV with the increasing flux
that becomes stronger with increasing energy up to 200 keV. This indicates an
anticorrelation between the electron temperature and luminosity, explained by
hot accretion models. In addition, we see a variable broad-band slope with a
pivot at 200 keV. We confirm the presence of pronounced hysteresis, with the
hard-to-soft state transitions occurring at much higher (and variable)
luminosities than the soft-to-hard transitions. We fit the ASM data with a
model consisting of an outer accretion disc and a hot inner flow. State
transitions are associated then with variations in the disc truncation radius,
which we fit as 6GM/c^2 in the soft state and several times that in the hard
state. The disappearence of the inner disc takes place at a lower accretion
rate than its initial appearance due to the dependence of the transitions on
the source history. We provide further evidence against the X-ray emission in
the hard state being nonthermal synchrotron, and explain the observed
radio-X-ray correlation by the jet power being correlated with the accretion
power.

that grains play an important role in the heating and cooling of photo-ionized
environments. A detailed code is necessary to model grains in a photo-ionized
medium. In this paper we will use the spectral synthesis code Cloudy for this
purpose. The grain model of this code has recently undergone a comprehensive
upgrade. Part of this is the newly developed hybrid grain charge model, which
will be described in detail. This model allows discrete charge states of very
small grains to be modelled accurately while simultaneously avoiding the
overhead of fully resolving the charge distribution of large grains, thus
making the model both accurate and computationally efficient. A comprehensive
comparison with the fully resolved charge state models of Weingartner & Draine
(2001) shows that the agreement is very satisfactory for realistic size
distributions. The effect of the grain size distribution on the line emission
from photo-ionized regions is studied by taking standard models for an H II
region and a planetary nebula and adding a dust component to the models with
varying grain size distributions. A comparison of the models shows that varying
the size distribution has a dramatic effect on the emitted spectrum, and
affects the ionization balance as well. These results clearly demonstrate that
the grain size distribution is an important parameter in photo-ionization
models.

field, and which are pressure-confined by a hot external medium. We study the
properties of LCDM Burkert (and NFW) minihalos with circular velocities 12-30
km/s. We present results for the volume densities and projected column
densities of low-ions, CII, NI, OI, SiII and SII, produced in the neutral
cores, and high-ions, CIV, NV, OVI, SiIII, SiIV, and SIII produced in the
ionized envelopes. We examine the possible relationships between the compact HI
high-velocity clouds (CHVCs), dwarf galaxies, and high-velocity ionized CIV
absorbers, within the context of photoionized minihalo models. In
pressure-confined (P/k ~50 K/cm^3) mini-halo models for the CHVCs the
photoionization states are much lower than in the CIV absorbers. However, for
lower bounding pressures (<~1 K/cm^3) in more massive dwarf galaxy scale halos,
the photoionization states in the outer envelopes resemble those observed in
the CIV HVCs. An important exception is OVI for which our photoionization
models underpredict the relative abundances by about an order-of-magnitude,
suggesting that additional processes are at play as concluded by Sembach et al.
For the cloud size-scales expected in median LCDM Burkert halos, a metallicity
of 0.3 solar is required to produce absorption-line strengths comparable to
those in the CIV HVCs. We argue that fully ionized and starless ""dark galaxies""
could be detectable in the local universe as UV metal line absorbers with
ionization states similar to the CIV absorbers.

intensities of these two lines behave differently with changing physical
conditions in the PDR, and, taken together, the two lines can provide a
ground-based radio astronomy diagnostic for determining n and G0 separately in
distant molecular clouds. This diagnostic is particularly useful in the range
Gzero <~ 100, 10 cm^{-3} <~ n <~ 10^5 cm^{-3}, which applies to a large
fraction of the volume of the interstellar medium in galaxies. If the molecular
cloud is located near discrete sources of far-UV (FUV) emission, the

ISOCAM to investigate the reliability of mid-infrared (MIR) dust emission as a
quantitative tracer of star formation (SF) activity. The total sample covers
very diverse galactic environments and probes a much wider dynamic range in SF
rate density than previous similar studies. We find that both the monochromatic
15 micron continuum and the 5-8.5 micron emission constitute excellent
indicators of the SF rate as quantified by the Lyman continuum luminosity
L_Lyc, within specified validity limits which are different for the two
tracers. Normalized to projected surface area, the 15 micron luminosity S_15ct
is directly proportional to S_Lyc over several orders of magnitude. Two regimes
are distinguished from the relative offsets in the observed relation: the
proportionality factor increases by a factor of ~ 5 between quiescent disks in
spiral galaxies, and moderate to extreme star-forming environments in
circumnuclear regions of spirals and in starburst systems. The transition
occurs near S_Lyc ~ 10^2 L_sun pc^{-2} and is interpreted as due to very small
dust grains starting to dominate the emission at 15 microns over aromatic
species above this threshold. The 5-8.5 micron luminosity per unit area is also
proportional to S_Lyc, with a single conversion factor from the most quiescent
objects in the sample up to S_Lyc ~ 10^4 L_sun pc^{-2}, where the relation then
flattens. The turnover is attributed to depletion of aromatic band carriers in
the harsher conditions prevailing in extreme starbursts. The observed relations
provide empirical calibrations useful for estimating SF rates from mid-IR
observations in deeply embedded HII regions and obscured starbursts, and for
predictions from evolutionary synthesis models.

least one encounter (per orbit) with another satellite galaxy. However, this
result depends on the age of the dark matter host halo with a clear trend for
more interactions in younger systems. We also report a correlation between the
number of encounters and the distance of the satellites to the centre of the

However, this can be simply explained by the radial distribution of the

that both Anomalous Cepheids (AC) and short-period Classical Cepheids s-pCC are

are identified in the same system even though they likely coexist, but have
gone unnoticed so far, in other low-metallicity galaxies like Leo A and Sextans

both young and intermediate-age (or old, depending on the nature of AC) stars.
The RR Lyrae candidates trace, together with the well developed horizontal

spatial distributions of s-pCC, AC and RR Lyrae variables in the Phoenix field
are consistent with the stellar population gradients found in Phoenix, in the
sense that the younger population is concentrated in the central part of the

When dividing the LFs into spectral types, we find that the LF of the
early-type galaxies alone can be described by a Gaussian, while the LF of the
late-type galaxies is well fitted by a Schechter function, suggesting that the
separate LFs for different populations may be universal. The difference in the
total LFs can mainly be attributed to the varying relative normalisation of
these populations, implying that clusters with an abundant population of
late-type galaxies also have steeper faint-end slopes. In MS1008-1224 we detect
a faint blue population that dominates over a population with colours
consistent with dwarf ellipticals, opposite to clusters at lower redshift.
Compared to low redshift clusters, we find that a general fading of the
late-type population by ~2 mag and the early-type population by ~1 mag
describes the evolution from z=0.55 to z=0 well. As a consequence of the
different early-type and late-type LFs and their dependence on cluster radius,
the fraction of blue cluster galaxies, as measured by the Butcher-Oemler
effect, differs between the clusters and depends on limiting magnitude and

be exploited to improve the throughput of modern spectrographs. The wavelength
of peak efficiency can be tuned by adjustment of the incidence angle. We show
that the variation of the Kogelnik efficiency versus Bragg angle depends only
on one parameter, given by $P_{tune} = (\Delta n d)/(n \Lambda)$, where:
$\Delta n$ is semi-amplitude of the refractive index modulation; $n$ is the
average index; $d$ is the thickness of the active layer; and $\Lambda$ is the
grating period. The efficiency has a well defined dependence on polarization.
In particular, it is possible to obtain theoretical 100% diffraction efficiency
with one linear polarization at any angle or to obtain 100% efficiency with
unpolarized light at specific angles. In the latter case, high efficiency is
the result of aligning the peaks of the s- and p-polarization
efficiency-versus-thickness curves. The first of these `s-p-phased gratings'

black hole ergosphere. The poloidal currents are driven by the gravitationally
induced electric field which cannot be screened within the ergosphere by any
static distribution of the electric charge of locally created pair plasma.
Contrary to what is expected in the Membrane paradigm, the energy and angular
momentum are extracted not only along the magnetic field lines penetrating the
event horizon but along all field lines penetrating the ergosphere. In dipolar
magnetic configurations symmetric relative to the equatorial plane the
force-free approximation breaks down within the ergosphere where a strong
current sheet develops along the equatorial plane. This current sheet supplies
energy and angular momentum at infinity to the surrounding force-free
magnetosphere. The Blandford-Znajek monopole solution is found to be
asymptotically stable and causal. The so-called horizon boundary condition of

two methods are found to be in agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively
via one and two points statistics.The infall takes place preferentially in the
plane perpendicular to the direction defined by the halo's spin. We computed
the excess of equatorial accretion both through rings and via a harmonic
expansion of the infall. The level of anisotropy of infalling matter is found
to be ~15 %. The substructures have their spin orthogonal to their velocity
vector in the halo's rest frame at a level of about 5%, suggestive of an image
of a flow along filamentary structures which provides an explanation for the
measured anisotropy. We conclude that a halo does not see its environment as an
isotropic perturbation, investigate how the anisotropy is propagated inwards
using perturbation theory, and discuss briefly implications for weak lensing,
warps and the thickness of galactic disks.

crucial circuit element for all Josephson qubits. We discuss the three types of

appearance of the macroscopic phase parameter. The Josephson equations are
derived using standard first and second order perturbation theory that describe
quasiparticle and Cooper-pair tunneling. An exact calculation of the Josephson
effect then follows using the quasiparticle bound-state theory, and then expand
upon this theory to describe quasiparticle excitations as transitions from the
ground to excited bound states from nonadiabatic changes in the bias. Although
quasiparticle current is typically calculated only for a constant DC voltage,
the advantage to this approach is seen where we qualitatively describe
quasiparticle tunneling with AC voltage excitations, as appropriate for the
qubit state. This section describes how the Josephson qubit is typically
insensitive to quasiparticle damping, even to the extent that a phase qubit can
be constructed from microbridge junctions.

dipole transition where the polarization of the incident light's electric field
is parallel to the ladder rungs, and is allowed by the dynamic DM interaction
created by a high frequency optical a-axis phonon. 2. In the incident light
polarization perpendicular to the ladder planes an enhancement of the singlet

to use the standard many-body description in terms of electrons and holes and
its associated Feynman diagrams. We then show how, by using the description of
a trion as an electron interacting with an exciton, we can obtain the trion
absorption through far simpler diagrams, written with electrons and
\emph{excitons}. These diagrams are quite novel because, for excitons being not
exact bosons, we cannot use standard procedures designed to deal with
interacting true fermions or true bosons. A new many-body formalism is
necessary to establish the validity of these electron-exciton diagrams and to
derive their specific rules. It relies on the ``commutation technique'' we
recently developed to treat interacting close-to-bosons. This technique
generates a scattering associated to direct Coulomb processes between electrons
and excitons and a dimensionless ``scattering'' associated to electron exchange
inside the electron-exciton pairs -- this ``scattering'' being the original
part of our many-body theory. It turns out that, although exchange is crucial
to differentiate singlet from triplet trions, this ``scattering'' enters the
absorption explicitly when the photocreated electron and the initial electron
have the same spin -- \emph{i}. \emph{e}., when triplet trions are the only
ones created -- \emph{but not} when the two spins are different, although
triplet trions are also created in this case. The physical reason for this
rather surprising result will be given.

zero surface, the dependence of the duality wall height on the couplings at

groupoids playing the r\^ole of groups. The notion of ""braided groupoid"" is
introduced. Braided groupoids are solutions and are characterized in terms of
bijective 1-cocycles. The structure groupoid of a non-degenerate solution is
defined; it is shown that it is braided groupoid. The reduced structure
groupoid of a non-degenerate solution is also defined. Non-degenerate solutions
are classified in terms of representations of matched pairs of groupoids. By
linearization we construct star-triangular face models and realize them as
modules over quasitriangular quantum groupoids introduced in recent papers by
M. Aguiar, S. Natale and the author.

all Hausdorff non-Archimedean spaces and uniformly continuous maps and
$\mathcal{V}$ is the class of all epimorphic embeddings in $\mathbf{NA}_0$.
  We determine the class ${\bf Inj} \mathcal{V}$ of all $\mathcal{V}$-injective
objects and we present an internal characterization as ""complete objects"". The
basic tool for this characterization is a notion of small collections that in
some sense preserve the inclusion order on the non-Archimedean structure. We
prove that the full subconstruct $\mathbf{CNA}_0$ consisting of all complete
objects forms a firmly $\mathcal{V}$-reflective subcategory. This means that
every object $X$ in $\mathbf{NA}_0$ has a completion which is a
$\mathcal{V}$-reflection $r_X:X\to RX$ into the full subconstruct
$\mathbf{CNA}_0$ of ""complete spaces"". Moreover this completion is unique (up
to isomorphism) in the sense that, considering $L(\mathbf{CNA}_0)$, the class
of all those morphisms $u: X\to Y$ for which $Ru:RX\to RY$ is an isomorphism,
one has that $\mathcal{V}$ is contained in $L(\mathbf{CNA}_0)$. In fact one
even has $\mathcal{V}=L(\mathbf{CNA}_0)$.
  Finally we apply our constructions to the classical case of Hausdorff
non-Archimedean uniform spaces, in that case our completion reduces to the
standard one.

studied in 2D and 3D spatially smooth flows. Tools borrowed from the study of
random dynamical systems are used to identify and to characterise in full
generality the mechanisms leading to the formation of strong inhomogeneities in
the particle concentration.
  Phenomenological arguments are used to show that in 2D, heavy particles form
dynamical fractal clusters when their Stokes number (non-dimensional viscous
friction time) is below some critical value. Numerical simulations provide
strong evidence for this threshold in both 2D and 3D and for particles not only
heavier but also lighter than the carrier fluid. In 2D, light particles are
found to cluster at discrete (time-dependent) positions and velocities in some
range of the dynamical parameters (the Stokes number and the mass density ratio
between fluid and particles). This regime is absent in 3D, where evidence is
that the Hausdorff dimension of clusters in phase space (position-velocity)
remains always above two.
  After relaxation of transients, the phase-space density of particles becomes
a singular random measure with non-trivial multiscaling properties. Theoretical
results about the projection of fractal sets are used to relate the
distribution in phase space to the distribution of the particle positions.
Multifractality in phase space implies also multiscaling of the spatial
distribution of the mass of particles. Two-dimensional simulations, using
simple random flows and heavy particles, allow the accurate determination of
the scaling exponents: anomalous deviations from self-similar scaling are
already observed for Stokes numbers as small as $10^{-4}$.

acoustic models in seismology and underwater acoustics. To date a generic form
of these procedures including fluid motion and time dependence has not appeared
in the literature. A detailed investigation of the characteristic curves of the
equations of hydrodynamics allows for an immediate generalization of the
procedure to be extracted from the equation form geodesic deviation. The
general paraxial ray trace equations serve as an ideal supplement to ordinary
ray tracing in predicting the deformation of acoustic beams in random
environments. The general procedure is derived in terms of affine
parameterization and in a coordinate time parameterization ideal for
application to physical acoustic ray propagation. The formalism is applied to
layered media, where the deviation equation reduces to a second order
differential equation for a single field with a general solution in terms of a
depth integral along the ray path. Some features are illustrated through
special cases which lead to exact solutions in terms of either ordinary or
special functions.

induction has been introduced, which permits symmetrical writing of the

relativity can be obtained from these laws through the Galilean
transformations. The permittivity and permeability of materials media are shown
to be independent of frequency. The notions magnetoelectrokinetic and
electromagnetopotential waves and kinetic capacity have been introduced. It is
shown that along with the longitudinal Langmuir resonance, the transverse
resonance is possible in nonmagnetized plasma, and both the resonances are
degenerate. A new notion scalar-vector potential is introduced, which permits

the scalar-vector potential makes the magnetic field notion unnecessary.

consequence of the bending of the shape parameter at old ages. This
investigation is based upon the Weon model (the Weibull model with an
age-dependent shape parameter) for human survival and mortality curves.
According to the Weon model, we are well able to describe the mortality
decrease after the mortality plateau, including the mortality deceleration.
Furthermore, we are able to simply define the mathematical limit of longevity
by the mortality decrease. From the demographic analysis of the historical
trends in Switzerland (1876-2001) and Sweden (1861-2001), and the most recent
trends in the other eleven developed countries (1996-2001), we confirm that the
bending of the shape parameter after characteristic life is correlated with the
mortality deceleration (or decrease). As a consequence, this bending of the
shape parameters and the mortality deceleration is associated with the
mathematical limit on longevity. These results suggest that the mathematical
limit of longevity can be induced by the mortality deceleration (or decrease)
in nature. These findings will give us a breakthrough for studying the
mortality dynamics at the highest ages.

continuous time walks without coin degrees of freedom, since it has been shown
recently that such a continuous time walk needs time $\Omega(N)$ to perform the
same task. Our result furthermore improves on a previous bound for quantum
local search by Aaronson and Ambainis. We generalize our result to 3 and more
dimensions where the walk yields the optimal performance of $O(\sqrt{N})$ and
give several extensions of quantum walk search algorithms for general graphs.
The coin-flip operation needs to be chosen judiciously: we show that another
``natural'' choice of coin gives a walk that takes $\Omega(N)$ steps. We also
show that in 2 dimensions it is sufficient to have a two-dimensional coin-space

inverting an external field to which it is coupled, and along which it is
initially aligned. In non-adiabatic twisted rapid passage, the external field
is allowed to twist around its initial direction with azimuthal angle \phi(t)
at the same time that it is non-adiabatically inverted. For polynomial twist,
\phi(t) \sim Bt^{n}. We show that for n \ge 3, multiple qubit resonances can
occur during a single inversion of the external field, producing strong
interference effects in the qubit transition probability. The character of the
interference is controllable through variation of the twist strength B.
Constructive and destructive interference are possible, greatly enhancing or
suppressing qubit transitions. Experimental confirmation of these controllable
interference effects has already occurred. Application of this interference
mechanism to the construction of fast fault-tolerant quantum CNOT and NOT gates
