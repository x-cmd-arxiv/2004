imposed magnetic field lowers the spectral magnetic energy in the inertial
range. This is explained by a suppression of the small scale dynamo. At large
scales, however, the spectral magnetic energy increases with increasing imposed
field strength for moderately strong fields, and decreases only slightly for
even stronger fields. The presence of Alfven waves is explicitly confirmed by
monitoring the evolution of magnetic field and velocity at one point. The
frequency omega agrees with vA k1, where vA is the Alfven speed and k1 is the
smallest wavenumber in the box.

few years. A simple cross-correlation study shows evidence for delays of up to
several hundred days between the variations seen at the shortest wavelengths

twice the interval covered earlier and the delay between its UV and IR outputs
persists. An analysis of the fluxes shows that, for any given galaxy, the
colours of the variable component are usually independent of the level of
activity. The state of activity can be parameterized. Taken over the whole
sample, the colours of the variable components fall within moderately narrowly
defined ranges. In particular, the H-K colour is appropriate to a black body of
temperature 1600K. The H-K excess for a heavily reddened nucleus can be
determined and used to find E_{B-V}, which can be compared to the values found
from the visible region broad line fluxes. Using flux-flux diagrams, the flux
within the aperture from the underlying galaxy can often be determined without
the need for model surface brightness profiles. In many galaxies it is apparent
that here must be an additional constant contribution from warm dust.

are very large. The abundance patterns of the heavy neutron-capture elements
(56 $\leq$ Z $\leq$ 70) in seven objects with moderate to large excesses of the
neutron-capture elements are similar to that of the solar system r-process

elements in these objects are primarily synthesized by the r-process. On the
other hand, the abundance ratios of the light neutron-capture elements (38
$\leq$ Z $\leq$ 46) exhibit a rather large dispersion. Our inspection of the
correlation between Sr and Ba abundances in very metal-poor stars reveals that
the dispersion of the Sr abundances clearly decreases with increasing Ba
abundance. This results support previous suggestions that the light
neutron-capture elements are likely to have been produced in different
astrophysical sites from those associated with the production of the heavier
ones. The Th/Eu abundance ratios (log(Th/Eu)) measured for the seven
r-process-enhanced stars range from -0.10 to -0.59. Since these very metal-poor
stars are believed to be formed in the early Galaxy, this result means that a
small dispersion appears in the abundance ratios between Th and rare-earth

line-of-sight without any dependence on the dynamical state of the mass, and
thus can be used to measure the masses of clusters even if they are not
relaxed. One common technique used to measure cluster masses is fitting
azimuthally-averaged gravitational shear profiles with a spherical mass model.
In this paper we quantify how asphericity and projected substructure in
clusters can affect the virial mass and concentration measured with this
technique by simulating weak lensing observations on 30 independent
lines-of-sights through each of four high-resolution N-body cluster
simulations. We find that the variations in the measured virial mass and
concentration are of a size similar to the error expected in ideal weak lensing
observations and are correlated, but that the virial mass and concentration of
the mean shear profile agree well with that measured in three dimensional
models of the clusters. The dominant effect causing the variations is the
proximity of the line-of-sight to the major axis of the 3-D cluster mass
distribution, with projected substructure only causing minor perturbations in
the measured concentration. Finally we find that the best-fit ""universal"" CDM
models used to fit the shear profiles over-predict the surface density of the
clusters due to the cluster mass density falling off faster than the r^{-3}
model assumption.

function and the galaxy distribution within the clusters. We find that the

concentration. Using this sample, whose masses span the range from
$3\times10^{13}M_\odot$ to $2\times10^{15}M_\odot$, we confirm the existence of
a tight correlation between total galaxy NIR luminosity and cluster binding
mass, which indicates that NIR light can serve as a cluster mass indicator.
  From the observed galaxy profile, together with cluster mass profile
measurements from the literature, we find that the \mlr is a weakly decreasing
function of cluster radius, and that it increases with cluster mass. We also
derive the mean number of galaxies within halos of a given mass. We find that
the mean number scales as $N\propto M^{0.84\pm0.04}$ for galaxies brighter than
$M_K=-21$, indicating high mass clusters have fewer galaxies per unit mass than
low mass clusters. Using published observations at high redshift, we show that
higher redshift clusters have higher mean occupation number than nearby systems
of the same mass. By comparing the luminosity function & radial distribution of
galaxies in low mass and high mass clusters, we show that there is a marked
decrease in the number density of galaxies fainter than $M_*$ as one moves to

probable in high mass clusters.

M31-RV is a gigantic stellar explosion that occurred during 1988 in the Bulge

supergiant reaching M_bol=-10. The 1988 outburst has been positively detected
on Asiago plates, and it has been the only such event recorded over the period
covered by the plates (1942-1993). In particular, an alleged previous outburst
in 1967 (Sharov 1990, SvAL, 16, 199) is excluded by the more numerous and
deeper Asiago plates, with relevant implication for the interpretative models
of this unique event. We outline a close analogy in spectral and photometric
evolution with those of V838 Mon which exploded in our Galaxy in 2002. The
analogy is found to extend also to the closely similar absolute magnitude at
the time of the sudden drop in photospheric temperature that both M31-RV and
V838 Mon exhibited. These similarities, in spite of the greatly differing
metallicity, age and mass of the two objects, suggest that the same, universal

current upper bounds from collider experiments on the tau magnetic moment, we

X-ray emission decreases faster along the jet than their radio emission,
resulting to an outward increasing radio to X-ray ratio. In some sources this
behavior is so extreme that the radio emission peak is located clearly
downstream of that of the X-rays. This is a rather unanticipated behavior given
that the inverse
  Compton nature of the X-rays and the synchrotron radio emission are
attributed to roughly the same electrons of the jet's non-thermal electron
distribution. In this note we show that this morphological behavior can result
from the gradual deceleration of a relativistic flow and that the offsets in
peak emission at different wavelengths carry the imprint of this deceleration.
This notion is consistent with another recent finding, namely that the jets
feeding the terminal hot spots of powerful radio galaxies and quasars are still
relativistic with Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim 2-3$. The picture of the
kinematics of powerful jets emerging from these considerations is that they
remain relativistic as they gradually decelerate from Kpc scales to the hot
spots, where, in a final collision with the intergalactic medium, they
slow-down rapidly to the subrelativistic velocities of the hot spot advance
speed.

via a z>6 source viewed at high magnification (~x25). Optical and IR photometry
from HST and Keck confirms the lensing hypothesis and suggests a significant
discontinuity occurs in the spectral energy distribution within 9250-9850A. If
this break is associated with Gunn-Peterson absorption from neutral
hydrogen,6.6<z<7.1 is inferred. Deep Keck spectroscopy conducted using both
optical and IR spectrographs fails to reveal any prominent emission lines in
this region. However, an IR stellar continuum is detected whose decline below
9800A suggests a spectroscopic redshift of z~7. Regardless of the precise
redshift, the source is remarkably compact (<1 kpc) and faint (z=28.0) yet is
undergoing vigorous star formation at a rate ~2.6 Mo/yr. An intriguing property
is the steep slope of the UV continuum implied by the photometry which may
suggest that the source is representative of an early population of galaxies
responsible for cosmic reionization. Independent verification of these results
is highly desirable but our attempts highlight the difficulty of studying such
sources with present facilities and the challenges faced in pushing back the

a large fraction of the extragalactic radio background (ERB) below 500 MHz. The
associated angular fluctuations dominate the sky for frequencies nu<10 GHz and
angular scales arcmin-deg (after a modest removal of point sources), provided
that xi_e*xi_B>3*10^-4. The fluctuating signal is most pronounced for nu<500

observable by next generation radio telescopes such as LOFAR and SKA, and is
marginally observable with present telescopes. It may be identified using
cross-correlations with tracers of large scale structure, possibly even in
existing <10 GHz CMB anisotropy maps and high resolution ~1 GHz radio surveys.
Detection of the signal will provide the first identification of intergalactic
shocks and of the WHIM, and gauge the unknown intergalactic magnetic field. We
show that existing observations of the diffuse <500 MHz radio background are
well fit by a simple, double-disk Galactic model, precluding a direct
identification of the diffuse ERB. Modelling the frequency-dependent anisotropy

fluctuations due to unresolved radio galaxies, cluster radio halos and relics
and free-free emission from the interstellar and intergalactic medium at the
frequencies and angular scales relevant for the proposed 21cm tomography. In
accord with previous findings, the brightness temperature fluctuations due to
foreground sources are much larger than those from the primary 21cm signal at
all scales. In particular, diffuse cluster radio emission, which has been
previously neglected, provides the most significant foreground contamination.
However, we show that the contribution to the angular fluctuations at scales

are detected and removed. Hence, efficient source removal may be sufficient to
allow the detection of angular fluctuations in the 21cm emission free of
extragalactic foregrounds at \theta > 1 arcmin. In addition, the removal of
sources above S=0.1 mJy also reduces the foreground fluctuations to roughly the

the substraction of the foreground components in frequency space, making it

above 10 keV a new very high energy component of the X-ray spectrum of Eta Car
extending to at least 50 keV. We find that the 2-150 keV spectrum is best
reproduced by a thermal + non-thermal model. The thermal component dominates
the 2-10 keV spectral range with kT_h=5.5 +/- 0.3 keV and log NH_h=22.68 +/-
0.01. The spectrum displays a prominent iron emission line centred at 6.70 keV.
Its equivalent width of 0.94 keV, if produced by the thermal source, gives a
slightly sub-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H]=-0.15 +/- 0.02).
  The high energy tail above 10 keV is best fitted by a power law with a photon
index of 2.42 +/- 0.04. The integrated 13-150 keV luminosity of ~12 L-sun is
comparable to that of the 2-10 keV thermal component. The present result can be
explained, in the Eta Car binary star scenario, by Comptonisation of low
frequency radiation by high energy electrons, probably generated in the
colliding wind shock front, or in instabilities in the wind of the S Dor
primary star. It is possible that the high energy tail had largely weakened
near the minimum of the 5.53 yr cycle. With respect to the thermal component,
it probably has a longer recovering time like that of the highest excitation

single-mode waveguides coupled with AO correction significantly reduces the
speckle noise which arises from residual wavefront corrugations. Focusing on
those sources, and in the light of the AMBER experiment (the near infrared

better Signal-to-Noise Ratio on the visibility than speckle interferometry.
This is true for bright sources (K < 5), and in any case as soon as Strehl
ratio of 0.2 is achieved. Finally, the fiber estimator is much more robust --
by two orders of magnitude -- than the speckle estimator with respect to Strehl
ratio variations during the calibration procedure. The present analysis

anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We base our study on

assumptions. Our method essentially takes benefit from the spatial correlation
between KSZ and the Compton parameter distribution associated with the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (TSZ) effect of the galaxy clusters, the later can be
obtained by means of multi-frequency based component separation techniques. We
reconstruct the KSZ signal by interpolating the CMB fluctuations without making
any hypothesis besides the CMB fluctuations are Gaussian distributed. We
present two ways of estimating the KSZ fluctuations, after the interpolation
step. In the first way we use a blind technique based on canonical Principal
Component Analysis, while the second uses a minimisation criterion based on the
fact that KSZ dominates a small angular scales and that it follows a
non-Gaussian distribution. We show using the correlation between the input and
reconstructed KSZ map that the latter can be reconstructed in a very
satisfactory manner (average correlation coefficient between 0.62 and 0.90),
furthermore both the retrieved KSZ power spectrum and temperature fluctuation
distribution are in quite good agreement with the original signal. The ratio
between the input and reconstructed power spectrum is indeed very close to one
up to a multipole $\ell\sim 200$ in the best case. The method presented here
can be considered as a promising starting point to identify in CMB observations
the temperature fluctuation associated with the KSZ effect.

Three-dimensional islands act as adatom sinks and the lower adatom density in

several different growth regimes in which pits may nucleate at different stages
of growth depending on the growth conditions and materials system. However
direct comparisons to experimental observations require that kinetics be taken
into account as well. The model predicts a wide range of possible morphologies:
planar films, islands alone, islands nucleation followed by pit nucleation, and
pits alone. The model shows good agreement with experimental observations in

exhibiting phase transitions and self-organization. Moreover, it is an
underpinning to extensive modern studies of traffic flow. The general belief is
that the system exhibits a sharp phase transition from freely flowing to fully
jammed, as a function of initial density of cars. However we discover
intermediate stable phases, where jams and freely flowing traffic coexist. The
geometric structure of such phases is highly regular, with bands of free
flowing traffic intersecting at jammed wavefronts that propagate smoothly
through the space. Instead of a phase transition as a function of density, we
see bifurcation points, where intermediate phases begin coexisting with the
more conventionally known phases. We show that the regular geometric structure
is in part a consequence of the finite size and aspect ratio of the underlying
lattice, and that for certain aspect ratios the asymptotic intermediate phase
is on a short periodic limit cycle (the exact microscopic configuration recurs
each tau timesteps, where tau is small compared to the system size). Aside from
describing these intermediate states, which previously were overlooked, we
derive simple equations to describe the geometric constraints, and predict

intrinsic Hirr characteristics of high-Tc superconductors. It has been assumed
that substitution of the larger alkaline earth cation, Ba(II), by the smaller,
Sr(II), might improve the Hirr characteristics as a consequence of the decrease
in the thickness of nonsuperconductive blocking block (BB). However, results of
the present work show that Sr substitution rather depresses the Hirr
characteristics of the Cu-1212-phase superconductors even though the thickness
of BB decreases. Both the amount of excess oxygen and the overall positive
charge are confirmed to remain constant upon the Sr substitution by
wet-chemical and XANES analyses, respectively. However, from neutron
diffraction data analysis it is found that Sr substitution breaks the
conductive CuO chains in BB by shifting part of the excess oxygen atoms from
the characteristic b-axis lattice site to the a-axis site. This is believed to
decrease the concentration of mobile holes in the BB, as supported by the
results of TEP measurements. The lower Hirr(T) lines of the Sr-substituted
samples may thus be attributed to the lower concentration of mobile holes in
BB.

NIC cards, a barrier latency of 14.20$\mu$s over 8 nodes is achieved. This is a

complicated. In a twisting subcase, where our main interests lie, it can be
given the following strange interpretation. If we allow the real Minkowski
space to be complexified so that the real Minkowski coordinates x^a take
complex values, i.e., x^a => z^a=x^a+iy^a with complex metric g=eta_abdz^adz^b,
the real vacuum Maxwell equations can be extended into the complex and
rewritten as curlW =iWdot, divW with W =E+iB. This subcase of Maxwell fields
can then be extended into the complex so as to have as source, a complex
analytic world-line, i.e., to now become complex Lienard-Wiechart fields. When
viewed as real fields on the real Minkowski space, z^a=x^a, they possess a real
principle null vector that is shear-free but twisting and diverging. The twist
is a measure of how far the complex world-line is from the real 'slice'. Most
Maxwell fields in this subcase are asymptotically flat with a time-varying set
of electric and magnetic moments, all depending on the complex displacements

neutrinos from SN1987A underwent flavor conversion. This must be taken into
account in the analysis of the data. Assuming the normal mass hierarchy of
neutrinos we calculate the permutation factors p for the Kamiokande-2, IMB and
Baksan detectors. The conversion inside the star leads to p = 0.28 - 0.32;
regeneration effects inside the Earth reduce this factor down to 0.15 - 0.20
(at E = 40 MeV). We study in details the influence of conversion on the
observed signal depending on the parameters of the original neutrino spectra.
For a given set of these parameters, the conversion could increase the average
energy of the observed events by up to 50 % and the number of events by a
factor of 2 at Kamiokande-2 and of 3 - 5 at IMB. Inversely, we find that
neglecting the conversion effects can lead up to 50 % error in the
determination of the average energy of the original antinu_e flux and about 50
% error on its luminosity. By comparison with experimental data we conclude
that the Kamiokande-2 data alone do not favor strong conversion effect. In
contrast, the combined analysis of the Kamiokande and IMB results slightly
favors strong conversion effects (that is, large difference of the original
spectra). In comparison with the no oscillation case, the latter require lower
average energy and higher luminosity of the original antinu_e flux.

formation of \textit{finite} domains characterized by a non-vanishing,

unique among quantum fields, is exploited to associate the A_{\mu\nu\rho} field
with the ``bag constant'' of the hadronic vacuum, or with the cosmological term
in the cosmic case. We find that the quantum fluctuations of A_{\mu\nu\rho} are
inversely proportional to the confinement volume and interpret the result as a
Casimir effect for the hadronic vacuum. With these results in hands and by
analogy with the electromagnetic and string case, we proceed to calculate the

field, later identified with the spin density current of a Dirac field. In
fact, one of the objectives of this paper is to investigate the impact of the
quantum fluctuations of A_{\mu\nu\rho} on the effective dynamics of the spinor
field. The consistency of the field equations, even at the classical level,
requires the introduction of a mass term for A_{\mu\nu\rho}. In this case, the
Casimir vacuum pressure includes a contribution that is explicitly dependent on
the mass of A_{\mu\nu\rho} and leads us to conclude that the mass term plays
the same role as the infrared cutoff needed to regularize the finite volume
partition functional previously calculated in the massless case. Remarkably,
even in the presence of a mass term, A_{\mu\nu\rho} contains a mixture of
massless and massive spin-0 fields so that the resulting equation is still
gauge invariant. This is yet another peculiar, but physically relevant property
of A_{\mu\nu\rho} since it is reflected in the effective dynamics of the spinor

  Our balance criterion is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for
criticality, based on a strengthened, infinite-dimensional version of the
Kuhn--Tucker theorem. We use this to prove that every critical link is C^1 with
finite total curvature. The balance criterion also allows us to explicitly
describe critical configurations (and presumed minimizers) for many links

configuration for two clasped ropes: near their tips the curvature is unbounded
and a small gap appears between the two components. These examples reveal the

$H\in\R_+^{k\times n}$ such that $V=WH$. Exact, non trivial, nonnegative
factorizations do not always exist, hence it is interesting to pose the
approximate NMF problem. The criterion which is commonly employed is
I-divergence between nonnegative matrices. The problem becomes that of finding,
for assigned $k$, the factorization $WH$ closest to $V$ in I-divergence. An
iterative algorithm, EM like, for the construction of the best pair $(W, H)$
has been proposed in the literature. In this paper we interpret the algorithm
as an alternating minimization procedure \`a la Csisz\'ar-Tusn\'ady and
investigate some of its stability properties. NMF is widespreading as a data
analysis method in applications for which the positivity constraint is
relevant. There are other data analysis methods which impose some form of
nonnegativity: we discuss here the connections between NMF and Archetypal
Analysis. An interesting system theoretic application of NMF is to the problem

with the Gutenberg-Richter scaling law. The present work suggests an
improvement of this model to account for long-range dispersions and large
spatial diffusion of sismic faults. An enhancement of the threshold speed of
shock waves driven by translated fault fronts is pointed out and shown to
result from the interactions between components of the system situated far
aways them and others. Due to the enhanced threshold speed, size of the sismic
fault gets increased but a control effect can still be gained from tunable
dispersion extent irrespective of the total length of the system. To the
viewpoint of the Burridge-Knopoff block-lattice model, this last consideration
introduces the possibility of sizable but finite interactions among infinitely
aligned massive blocks. Implications on the fault wave propagation are examined
by numerical simulations of the improved nonlinear partial differential
equation.

  with Long-range dispersions",,,,,"nlin.PS",,"  The long-wavelength, weak-dispersion limit of the discrete nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation with long-range dispersion is analytically considered.
This continuum approximation is carried out irrespective of the dispersion
range and hence can be assumed exact in the weak dispersion regime. For
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations showing finite dispersion extents, the
long-range parameter is still a relevant control parameter allowing to tune the
dispersion from short-range to long-range regimes with respect to the
dispersion extent. The long-range Kac-Baker potential becomes unappropriate in
this context owing to an ""edge anomaly"" consisting of vanishing maximum
dispersion frequency and group velocity(and in turn soliton width) in the
""Debye"" limit. An improved Kac-Baker potential is then considered which gives
rise to a non-zero maximum frequency, and allows for soliton excitations with
finite widths in the nonlinear Schr\""odinger system subjected to the long-range
but finite-extent dispersion.

presented and discussed on mean field potentials, saturation properties for

neutron stars. Though the interaction strengths and the potentials given by
various interactions are quite different in nuclear matter, the differences of
saturation properties are subtle, except for NL2 and TM2, which are mainly used
for light nuclei, while the properties by various interactions for pure neutron
matter are quite different. To get an equation of state for neutron matter
without any ambiguity, it is necessary to constrain the effective interactions
either by microscopic many-body calculations for the neutron matter data or the
data of nuclei with extreme isospin. For neutron stars, the interaction with
large interaction strengths give strong potentials and large
Oppenheimer-Volkoff (OV) mass limits. The density-dependent interactions DD-ME1
and TW-99 favor a large neutron population due to their weak $\rho$-meson field
at high densities. The OV mass limits calculated from different equations of

Shell Model studies, which have resulted in remarkable gains in our
understanding of the structure of the nucleus. Indeed, it is now possible to
diagonalize matrices in determinantal spaces of dimensionality up to 10^9 using
the Lanczos tridiagonal construction, whose formal and numerical aspects we
will analyze. Besides, many new approximation methods have been developed in
order to overcome the dimensionality limitations. Furthermore, new effective
nucleon-nucleon interactions have been constructed that contain both two and
three-body contributions. The former are derived from realistic potentials
(i.e., consistent with two nucleon data). The latter incorporate the pure
monopole terms necessary to correct the bad saturation and shell-formation
properties of the realistic two-body forces. This combination appears to solve
a number of hitherto puzzling problems. In the present review we will
concentrate on those results which illustrate the global features of the
approach: the universality of the effective interaction and the capacity of the
Shell Model to describe simultaneously all the manifestations of the nuclear
dynamics either of single particle or collective nature. We will also treat in
some detail the problems associated with rotational motion, the origin of
quenching of the Gamow Teller transitions, the double beta-decays, the effect
of isospin non conserving nuclear forces, and the specificities of the very
neutron rich nuclei. Many other calculations--that appear to have ``merely''
spectroscopic interest--are touched upon briefly, although we are fully aware
that much of the credibility of the Shell Model rests on them.

terms of the current-nucleon forward scattering amplitude. Generalizing vector
meson dominance we allow for a direct coupling of the current to the nucleon as
well as a coupling via the rho meson. We discuss the N_c dependence of (a)
modifications of the pion cloud of the rho meson, (b) mixing with other mesons

a generalization of the second hypervirial method previously employed in the
non-relativistic Schr\""odinger case. An extension of the relations to the case
of two potentials in the so-called unshifted case, but using an arbitrary
radial function instead of a power one, is also given. Several important
results are obtained as special instances of our recurrence relations, such as
a generalization to the relativistic case of the Pasternack-Sternheimer rule.
