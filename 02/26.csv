weaker than that of 2dFGRS galaxies, in agreement with theoretical predictions.
We have subdivided the 2PIGG catalogue into samples that span a factor of 25 in
median total luminosity. Our correlation function measurements span an
unprecedented range of clustering strengths, connecting the regimes probed by
groups fainter than L* galaxies and rich clusters. There is a steady increase

places the star at the expected evolutionary position in the HR diagram, i.e.
as a PMS star. The distance for HD 141569 found in this work matches the {\it

coincident with the radio pulsar PSR 1820-30A. However, the pulsar's radio
emission falls rapidly with frequency (proportional to \nu^(-3)) and we argue
that the X-ray binary's radio emission is dominant above ~2 GHz. Supporting
this interpretation, comparison with previous observations reveals variability
at the higher radio frequencies that is likely to be due to the X-ray binary.

investigate hydrocarbon aerosol formation in the atmospheres of CEGPs. We find
that the abundances of hydrocarbons in the atmospheres of CEGPs are
significantly less than that of Jupiter except for models in which the CH$_4$
abundance is unreasonably high (as high as CO) for the hot (effective
temperatures $\gtrsim 1000$ K) atmospheres. Moreover, the hydrocarbons will be
condensed out to form aerosols only when the temperature-pressure profiles of
the species intersect with the saturation profiles--a case almost certainly not
realized in the hot CEGPs atmospheres. Hence our models show that photochemical
hydrocarbon aerosols are insignificant in the atmospheres of CEGPs. In
contrast, Jupiter and Saturn have a much higher abundance of hydrocarbon
aerosols in their atmospheres which are responsible for strong absorption
shortward of 600 nm. Thus the insignificance of photochemical hydrocarbon
aerosols in the atmospheres of CEGPs rules out one class of models with low

constant density slab illuminated by a blackbody, the spectrum emitted by a
neutron star burst. The calculations predict a prominent Fe K line and a rich
soft X-ray line spectrum which is superimposed on a strong free-free continuum.
The lines slowly vanish as the ionization parameter of the slab is increased,
but the free-free continuum remains dominant at energiesless than 1 keV. The
reflection spectrum has a quasi-blackbody shape only at energies greater than 3
keV. If the incident blackbody is added to the reflection spectrum, the Fe K
equivalent width varies between 100 and 300 eV depending on the ionization
parameter and the temperature, kT, of the blackbody. The equivalent width is
correlated with kT, and therefore we predict a strong Fe K line when an X-ray
burst is at its brightest (if iron is not too ionized or the reflection
amplitude too small). Extending the study of reflection features in the spectra
of superbursts to lower energies would provide further constraints on the
accretion flow. If the Fe K line or other features are relativistically
broadened then they can determine the system inclination angle (which leads to
the neutron star mass), and, if the mass is known, a lower-limit to the

analysed using these methods to infer source properties such as dust
temperature, mass, opacity function, and density distribution. Any
discrepancies between the inferred and model quantities can be attributed to
the analysis methods. The range of validity of most methods is smaller than
expected, due to two effects: (1) limited applicability of the Rayleigh-Jeans
limit except to very long wavelengths, and (2) significant errors in the
isothermal approximation, even when temperature variations are less than 2 K
over 90% of the region. Still, an accurate mean dust temperature can be found
using a modified Wien's law. This temperature can yield dust masses to within
10-25% -- much better than masses inferred from the integrated luminosity.
Using long wavelengths (greater than 1000 - 2000 microns), the opacity index
can be determined from the far-IR spectrum to within 20%. Fitting the spectrum
yields better results. The desnity distribution can be somewhat constrained by
fitting the surface brightness, for well-resolved sources. Better results are
found by fitting the flux spectrum with detailed models.

metallic lines with variable blueshifted and redshifted absorption features
superimposed to the photospheric stellar spectra. Synthetic Kurucz models are
used to estimate rotational velocities, effective temperatures and gravities of
the stars. The best photospheric models are subtracted from each observed
spectrum to determine the variable absorption features due to the circumstellar
gas; those features are characterized in terms of their velocity, v, dispersion
velocity, Delta v, and residual absorption, R_max. The absorption components
detected in each spectrum can be grouped by their similar radial velocities and
are interpreted as the signature of the dynamical evolution of gaseous clumps
with, in most cases, solar-like chemical composition. This infalling and
outflowing gas has similar properties to the circumstellar gas observed in UX
Ori, emphasizing the need for detailed theoretical models, probably in the
framework of the magnetospheric accretion scenario, to understand the complex
environment in Herbig Ae (HAe) stars. WW Vul is unusual because, in addition to
infalling and outflowing gas with properties similar to those observed in the
other stars, it shows also transient absorption features in metallic lines with
no obvious counterparts in the hydrogen lines. This could, in principle,
suggest the presence of CS gas clouds with enhanced metallicity around WW Vul.
The existence of such a metal-rich gas component, however, needs to be
confirmed by further observations and a more quantitative analysis.

candidates from optical surveys. The estimated isotropic X-ray luminosities of

The spectral properties and variability of M31 GC X-ray sources are consistent

that ~80% of the M31 GC sources with multiple flux measurements available show
significant variability on a time scales from days to years. The X-ray
luminosity function of GC sources is found to be significantly different from
that of the point sources in the bulge and disk of M31 and that of the Galactic
GC X-ray sources. GC sources make dominant contribution to the bright source
counts in the areas of M31 covered by the survey: ~40% of the total number of
sources with luminosities above 10e37 ergs/s reside in GCs with fraction of GC
sources rising to 67-90% for the luminosities above 10e38 ergs/s. The

M31 is much higher than in the Milky Way galaxy, but surprisingly close to that
of the early-type galaxies. The brightest M31 GC sources tend to reside at
large galactocentric distances outside the central bulge. We found that
globular clusters hosting bright X-ray sources are optically brighter and more

that the possible phase separation of helium from liquid metallic hydrogen in

than have been predicted by homogeneous models. For our chosen phase diagram
this phase separation will begin to affect the planets' evolution at ~700 Myr
for a 0.15 M_J object and ~10 Gyr for a 3.0 M_J object. We show how phase
separation affects the luminosity, effective temperature, radii, and
atmospheric helium mass fraction as a function of age for planets of various
masses, with and without heavy element cores, and with and without the effect
of modest stellar irradiation. This phase separation process will likely not
affect giant planets within a few AU of their parent star, as these planets
will cool to their equilibrium temperatures, determined by stellar heating,
before the onset of phase separation. We discuss the detectability of these
objects and the likelihood that the energy provided by helium phase separation
can change the timescales for formation and settling of ammonia clouds by
several Gyr. We discuss how correctly incorporating stellar irradiation into
giant planet atmosphere and albedo modeling may lead to a consistent
evolutionary history for Jupiter and Saturn.

holes. A nearby but somewhat more massive star cluster (MGG-9) shows no
evidence of such an intermediate mass black hole, raising the issue of just
what physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this difference.
Here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and the motions of stars
within the clusters, where stars are allowed to mergers with each other. We
find that for MGG-11 dynamical friction leads to the massive stars sinking
rapidly to the center of the cluster to participate in a runaway collision,
thereby producing a star of 800-3000Msun, which ultimately collapses to an
black hole of intermediate mass. No such runaway occurs in the cluster MGG-9

on the recently discovered physical connections between nuclear supermassive
BHs and their hosting spheroids (spiral bulges or ellipticals). In particular
we compare BH masses of NLS1s and S1s analyzing the properties of their hosts
by means of spectroscopic and photometric data in the optical wavelength
domain. We find that NLS1s fill the low BH mass and bulge luminosity values of
the BH mass - bulge magnitude relation, a result strongly suggesting that NLS1s
are active nuclei where less massive BHs are hosted by less massive bulges. The
correlation is good with a relatively small scatter fitting simultaneously
NLS1s, S1s and quasars. On the other hand, NLS1s seem to share the same stellar
velocity dispersion range of S1s in the BH mass - stellar velocity dispersion
relation, indicating that NLS1s have a smaller BH/bulge mass ratio than S1s.
These two conflicting results support in any case the idea that NLS1s could be
young S1s. Finally we do not confirm the significantly non linear BH--bulge
relation claimed by some authors.

still largely unclear. Here the amount of gas shed by the (older) halo red
giants is estimated. The distribution of red giants (RGs) in the halo is not
known but that of a subset of stars in the post RG phase, the sdB stars of the
horizontal-branch (HB), is. Using the mid-plane density and $z$-distribution of
sdB stars, the ratio of sdB stars to all HB stars, and the RG mass loss, the
infall due to total mass lost by all halo RG stars at $z>1$ kpc is calculated.
For the extended halo component $\dot{M}_{\rm halo RGs} \simeq 1.4 \cdot
10^{-5}$ \msun kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ while the thick disk component RGs
contribute $\dot{M}_{\rm thick disk RGs} \simeq 5.4 \cdot 10^{-5}$ \msun
kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, each with an uncertainty of a factor 4. The total rate of
infall due to RG mass-loss is $\dot{M}_{{\rm RGs at\}z>1 {\rm kpc}} \simeq 7
\cdot 10^{-5}$ \msun kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, a sizeable fraction of the equally
uncertain observed rate of infall of material. Since most of the RG stars in
the extended halo are old, their mass loss is predominantly metal-poor, while
that of the disk RGs is more metal-rich. The galactic fountain flow provides
additional metal-rich infall and small galaxies being accreted contribute to
the infall of gas as well.

galaxies follow a relation between luminosity of the brightest young cluster
and the star-formation rate (SFR) of the host galaxy, in the sense that higher
SFRs lead to the formation of brighter clusters. Assuming that the empirical
relation between maximum cluster luminosity and SFR reflects an underlying
similar relation between maximum cluster mass (M_ecl,max) and SFR, we compare
the resulting SFR(M_ecl,max) relation with different theoretical models. The
empirical correlation is found to suggest that individual star clusters form on
a free-fall time-scale with their pre-cluster molecular-cloud-core radii
typically being a few pc independent of mass. The cloud cores contract by
factors of 5 to 10 while building-up the embedded cluster. A theoretical
SFR(M_ecl,max) relation in very good agreement with the empirical correlation
is obtained if the cluster mass function of a young population has a Salpeter
exponent beta approx. 2.35 and if this cluster population forms within a
characteristic time-scale of a few-10 Myr. This short time-scale can be
understood if the inter-stellar medium is pressurised thus precipitating rapid
local fragmentation and collapse on a galactic scale. Such triggered star
formation on a galactic scale is observed to occur in interacting galaxies.
With a global SFR of 3-5 Msol/yr the Milky Way appears to lie on the empirical
SFR(M_ecl,max) relation, given the recent detections of very young clusters
with masses near 10^5 Msol in the Galactic disk. The observed properties of the
stellar population of very massive young clusters suggests that there may exist
a fundamental maximum cluster mass, 10^6 < M_ecl,max*/Msol < 10^7.

core regions of galaxy clusters fail to explain both the observed temperature
structure of this gas, and the observed morphology of radio-galaxy/ICM
interactions. It has recently been suggested that, even in the presence of
reasonable magnetic fields, thermal conduction in the ICM may be crucial for
reproducing the temperature floor seen in many systems. If this is indeed
correct, it raises the possibility that other transport processes may be
important. With this motivation, we present a numerical investigation of the
buoyant evolution of AGN-blown cavities in ICM that has a non-negligible shear
viscosity. We use the ZEUS-MP code to follow the 3-d evolution of an initially
static, hot bubble in a beta-model ICM atmosphere with varying degrees of shear
viscosity. With no explicit viscosity, it is found that the combined action of
Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities shred the ICM cavity and one
does not reproduce the intact and detached ``ghost cavities'' observed in
systems such as Perseus-A. On the other hand, even a modest level of shear
viscosity can be important in quenching the fluid instabilities and maintaining
the integrity of the bubble. In particular, we show that the morphology of the
NW ghost cavity found in Perseus-A can be reproduced, as can the flow pattern
inferred from the morphology of H-alpha filaments. Finally, we discuss the
possible relevance of ICM viscosity to the fact that many of the active ICM
cavities are not bounded by strong shocks.

apparently an O3 V+O3 V eclipsing binary, and a follow-up radial velocity study

3,000-4,000$^\circ$K hotter than their Galactic counterparts for the early

since the discovery of the phenomenon. Recent work has focussed on a sharp
'kink' in the kinetic energy spectra of the electrons as a possible signature
of the force that creates the superconducting state. The kink has been related
to a magnetic resonance and also to phonons. Here we report that infrared
spectra of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+d), (Bi-2212) show that this sharp feature can be
separated from a broad background and, interestingly, weakens with doping
before disappearing completely at a critical doping level of 0.23 holes per
copper atom. Superconductivity is still strong in terms of the transition
temperature (Tc approx 55 K), so our results rule out both the magnetic
resonance peak and phonons as the principal cause of high-Tc superconductivity.
The broad background, on the other hand, is a universal property of the copper
oxygen plane and a good candidate for the 'glue' that binds the electrons.

surfaces and interfaces that appear in a wide range of physical systems.
Nowadays, this prediction seems to be inaccurate. This situation has caused a
clear detriment of these studies in spite of the undeniable existence of
kinetic roughening in many different real systems, and without a clear
understanding of the reasons behind the mismatch between theoretical
expectations and experimental observations. In this chapter we aim to explore
existing problems and shortcomings of both the theoretical and experimental

suggests that the theoretical framework as yet is not complete, while more

depending on the coupling strength. In particular, donorlike states originating
from heptagonal rings are found to give a very narrow level. Interference
between broad and narrow levels produces Fano-type resonant backscattering as
well as resonant tunneling. Over a significantly wide energy range, almost
perfect suppression of the conduction of $\pi^{*}$ electrons occurs, which may
be regarded as filtering of particular electrons ($\pi$-pass filter).

stimulated emission (SE) are experimentally revealed for periodically forced
multimode ruby phaser (phonon laser) operating at SE frequencies about 9 GHz,
i.e. at microwave acoustic wavelengths of 1 micron. The inversion state of
Cromium(3+) spin-system in ruby was created by electromagnetic pump at 23 GHz.
Under deep modulation of pump power at low frequencies OMEGA_m = 70-200 Hz
deterministic chaotic reconfigurations of the acoustic microwave power spectra
(AMPS) were observed. This range of SE destabilization corresponds to the
relaxational resonance that is well known for optical class-B lasers. Outside
the relaxational resonance range, namely at ultra-low (infrasonic) frequencies
OMEGA_m about 10 Hz, the other type of resonant destabilization of stationary
phonon SE was observed by us for the first time. This new nonlinear resonance
(we call it lambda-resonance) manifests itself as very slow and periodically
repeated self-reconfigurations of AMPS. Near the vertex of lambda-resonance the
period of AMPS self-reconfigurations takes giant values of several hours (at
T=1.8 K). The second type of SE resonant destabilization is explained in terms
of antiphase energy exchange between acoustic SE modes in a modulated phaser.
The role of polarized nuclear spin-reservoir (formed by Aluminium-27 nuclei of
the ruby crystalline matrix) in these superslow self-organized motions is
discussed. PACS: 05.65.+b, 42.65.Sf, 43.35.+d

is to elucidate the important role of the helical symmetry in the formation,
stability and dynamical properties of Davydov's solitons in an alpha-helix. We
show, analytically and numerically, that the corresponding system of nonlinear
equations admits several types of stationary soliton solutions and that
solitons which preserve helical symmetry are dynamically unstable: once formed,
they decay rapidly when they propagate. On the other hand, the soliton which
spontaneously breaks the local translational and helical symmetries possess the
lowest energy and is a robust localized entity. We also demonstrate that this
soliton is the result of an hybridization of the quasiparticle states from the
two lowest degenerate bands and has an inner structure which can be described
as a modulated multi-hump amplitude distribution of excitations on individual
spines. The complex and composite structure of the soliton manifests itself
distinctly when the soliton is moving and some interspine oscillations take
place. Such a soliton structure and the interspine oscillations have previosly
been observed numerically in [A.C. Scott, Phys.Rev. A 26 578 (1982)]. Here we
argue that the solitons studied by A. Scott, are hybrid solitons and that the
oscillations arise due to the helical symmetry of the system and result from
the motion of the soliton along the $\alpha$-helix. The frequency of the
interspine oscillations is shown to be proportional to the soliton velocity.

detection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of
problems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they
rely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.

to formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined
with other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning
theory.

promotes to quantum operators all variables in a system, and later chooses one
of the variables to operate like a ``clock''. Conditional probabilities are
computed for variables of the system to take certain values when the ``clock''
specifies a certain time. This framework is attractive in contexts where the
assumption of usual quantum mechanics of the existence of an external,
perfectly classical clock, appears unnatural, as in quantum cosmology. Until
recently, there were problems with such constructions in ordinary quantum
mechanics with additional difficulties in the context of constrained theories
like general relativity. A scheme we recently introduced to consistently
discretize general relativity removed such obstacles. Since the clock is now an
object subject to quantum fluctuations, the resulting evolution in the time is
not exactly unitary and pure states decohere into mixed states. Here we work
out in detail the type of decoherence generated, and we find it to be of
Lindblad type. This is attractive since it implies that one can have loss of
coherence without violating the conservation of energy. We apply the framework
to a simple cosmological model to illustrate how a quantitative estimate of the
effect could be computed. For most quantum systems it appears to be too small
to be observed, although certain macroscopic quantum systems could in the
future provide a testing ground for experimental observation.

length of the J/psi to the data obtained at the CERN SPS by the NA50

determine the temperature and the energy density of the pion gas. For both
these quantities we find values close to those indicated by lattice gauge

to more central collisions, which takes into account the increase of the energy
deposited due to the increased nucleon flux, fails to reproduce the break in
J/psi absorption indicated by NA50, thus lending support to the idea that an
unconfined quark-gluon phase may have been produced. This conclusion could be
sharpened by analysing in a similar way, as a function of centrality, other

of matter creation in the context of a recent scenario \cite{RHBrev} in which
the back-reaction of long wavelength cosmological perturbations induces a
negative contribution to the cosmological constant and leads to a dynamical
relaxation of the bare cosmological constant. The initially large cosmological
constant gives rise to primordial inflation, during which cosmological
perturbations are stretched beyond the Hubble radius. The cumulative effect of
the long wavelength fluctuations back-reacts on the background geometry in a
form which corresponds to the addition of a negative effective cosmological
constant to the energy-momentum tensor. In the absence of an effective scalar
field driving inflation, whose decay can reheat the Universe, the challenge is
to find a mechanism which produces matter at the end of the relaxation process.
In this Letter, we point out that the decay of a condensate representing the
order parameter for a ``flat'' direction in the field theory moduli space can
naturally provide a matter generation mechanism. The order parameter is
displaced from its vacuum value by thermal or quantum fluctuations, it is
frozen until the Hubble constant drops to a sufficiently low value, and then
begins to oscillate about its ground state. During the period of oscillation it
can decay into Standard Model particles similar to how the inflaton decays in
scalar-field-driven models of inflation.

types of logarithmic singularities arising are classified and the

usual pattern of the structure of four-point function of other examples of

can be identified as the phenomena responsible for the appearance of such

relations between different logarithmic solutions. This Liouville description

magnetosheath, and along auroral field lines at 4.5-6.5 Re. Using the Wideband
waveform data from the various Cluster spacecraft we have carried out a survey
of the amplitudes and time durations of these structures and how these
quantities vary with the local magnetic field strength. Such a survey has not
been carried out before, and it reveals certain characteristics of solitary
structures in a finite magnetic field, a topic still inadequately addressed by
theories. We find that there is a broad range of electric field amplitudes at
any specific magnetic field strength, and there is a general trend for the
electric field amplitudes to increase as the strength of the magnetic field
increases over a range of 5 to 500 nT. We provide a possible explanation for
this trend that releates to the structures being Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode
solitary waves. There is no corresponding dependence of the duration of the
structures on the magnetic field strength, although a plot of these two
quantities reveals the unexpected result that with the exception of the
magnetosheath, all of the time durations for all of the other regions are
comparable, wheras the magnetosheath time durations clearly are in a different
category of much smaller time duration. We speculate that this implies the

amorphous wires is investigated under the condition of sinusoidal (50 MHz) and
pulsed (5 ns rising time) current excitations. For comparison, the field
characteristics of the diagonal impedance are measured as well. In general,
when an alternating current is applied to a magnetic wire the voltage signal is
generated not only across the wire but also in the coil mounted on it. These
voltages are related with the diagonal and off-diagonal impedances,
respectively. It is demonstrated that these impedances have a different
behaviour as a function of axial magnetic field: the former is symmetrical and
the latter is antisymmetrical with a near linear portion within a certain field
interval. In the case of the off-diagonal response, the dc bias current
eliminating circular domains is necessary. The pulsed excitation that combines
both high and low frequency harmonics produces the off-diagonal voltage
response without additional bias current or field. This suits ideal for a
practical sensor circuit design. The principles of operation of a linear

coupling to the environment. Asymptotically, negativity tends to zero, a

both results express some kind of impossibility it is natural to ask whether
there is any relation between them, and, indeed, this question has been
repeatedly asked for a long time. The main interest seems to have been in
possible implications of incompleteness to physics. In this note we will take
interest in the {\it converse} implication and will offer a positive answer to
the question: Does uncertainty imply incompleteness? We will show that
algorithmic randomness is equivalent to a ``formal uncertainty principle''
which implies Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness. We also show that
the derived uncertainty relation, for many computers, is physical. In fact, the
formal uncertainty principle applies to {\it all} systems governed by the wave
equation, not just quantum waves. This fact supports the conjecture that
uncertainty implies randomness not only in mathematics, but also in physics.

algorithm on a variant of Satisfiability problem for an ensemble of random

introduce a set of macroscopic parameters (landscapes) and put forward an
ansatz of universality for random bit flips. We then formulate the problem of
finding the smallest eigenvalue and the excitation gap as a statistical
mechanics problem. We use the so-called annealing approximation with a
refinement that a finite set of macroscopic variables (versus only energy) is
used, and are able to show the existence of a dynamic threshold
$\gamma=\gamma_d$ starting with some value of K -- the number of variables in
each clause. Beyond dynamic threshold, the algorithm should take exponentially
long time to find a solution. We compare the results for extended and
simplified sets of landscapes and provide numerical evidence in support of our
universality ansatz. We have been able to map the ensemble of random graphs
onto another ensemble with fluctuations significantly reduced. This enabled us
to obtain tight upper bounds on satisfiability transition and to recompute the
dynamical transition using the extended set of landscapes.
