clusters and galaxies simulated with up to 25 million particles. With thousands
of subhalos per object we can accurately measure their spatial clustering and
velocity distribution functions and compare these with observational data. The
substructure properties of galactic halos closely resembles those of galaxy
clusters with a small scatter in the mass and circular velocity functions. The
velocity distribution function is non-Maxwellian and flat topped with a
negative kurtosis of about -0.7. Within the virial radius the velocity bias
$b=\sigma_{\rm sub}/\sigma_{\rm DM}\sim 1.12 \pm 0.04$, increasing to b > 1.3
within the halo centers. Slow subhalos are much less common, due to physical
disruption by gravitational tides early in the merging history. This leads to a
spatially anti-biased subhalo distribution that is well fitted by a cored
isothermal. Observations of cluster galaxies do not show such biases which we
interpret as a limitation of pure dark matter simulations - we estimate that we
are missing half of the halo population which has been destroyed by physical
overmerging. High resolution hydrodynamical simulations are required to study
these issues further. If CDM is correct then the cluster galaxies must survive
the tidal field, perhaps due to baryonic inflow during elliptical galaxy
formation. Spirals can never exist near the cluster centers and the elliptical
galaxies there will have little remaining dark matter. This implies that the
morphology-density relation is set {\it before} the cluster forms, rather than
a subsequent transformation of disks to S0's by virtue of the cluster
environment.

produced by Thomson scattering of the CMB temperature quadrupole. In principle
this allows measurement of the CMB power spectrum harmonic $C_2(z)$ with higher
accuracy (at $z>0$) than the cosmic variance limit imposed by sample variance
on one CMB sky. However the observed signals are statistically correlated if
the comoving separation between the clusters is small enough. Thus one cannot
reduce the sample variance by more than roughly the number of separate regions
available which produce uncorrelated signals, as first pointed out by
Kamionkowski and Loeb. In this paper we analyze in detail the procedure
outlined by Kamionkowski and Loeb, computing the correlation of the
polarization signals by considering the variation of the spherical harmonic
expansion coefficients of the temperature anisotropy on our past light cone. We
find that in fact the cosmic variance is not reducible below the single sky CMB
value using the cluster method. Thus this method is not likely to be of use for
reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum. However the method does yield
a measurement of $C_2$ as a function of redshift with increasing accuracy at
higher redshift, and thus potentially a probe of the mechanism which may have
suppressed the quadrupole. (abridged)

studied performing numerical simulations in full general relativity. Neutron
stars are modeled by a polytropic equation of state for simplicity. A
gauge-invariant wave extraction method as well as a quadrupole formula are
adopted for computation of gravitational waves. It is found that the
gauge-invariant variables systematically contain numerical errors generated
near the outer boundaries in the present axisymmetric computation. We clarify
their origin, and illustrate it possible to eliminate the dominant part of the
systematic errors. The best corrected waveforms for oscillating and rotating
stars currently contain errors of magnitude $\sim 10^{-3}$ in the local wave
zone. Comparing the waveforms obtained by the gauge-invariant technique with
those by the quadrupole formula, it is shown that the quadrupole formula yields
approximate gravitational waveforms besides a systematic underestimation of the
amplitude of $O(M/R)$ where $M$ and $R$ denote the mass and the radius of
neutron stars. However, the wave phase and modulation of the amplitude can be
computed accurately. This indicates that the quadrupole formula is a useful
tool for studying gravitational waves from rotating stellar core collapse to a
neutron star in fully general relativistic simulations. Properties of the
gravitational waveforms from the oscillating and rigidly rotating neutron stars
are also addressed paying attention to the oscillation associated with
fundamental modes.

coincides with the one in Einstein gravity, which leads to the same likelihood
results in terms of inflationary observables. We apply this formalism to
nonminimally coupled chaotic inflationary scenarios with potential $V=c\phi^p$
and place constraints on the strength of nonminimal couplings using a
compilation of latest observational data. In the case of the quadratic
potential ($p=2$), the nonminimal coupling is constrained to be $\xi>-7.0

bound. Although the quartic potential ($p=4$) is under a strong observational
pressure for $\xi=0$, this property is relaxed by taking into account negative
nonminimal couplings. We find that inflationary observables are within the

mass of $25M_{\odot}$ is used as the initial data for the distribution of
thermodynamic quantities in the outer shells of a high-mass star. We analyze in
detail the results of three calculations in which the difference mesh and the
location of the inner boundary of the computational region are varied. In the
initial data, we roughly specify an angular velocity distribution that is
actually justified by the final result - the formation of a hydrostatic
equilibrium toroidal atmosphere with reasonable total mass, $M^{tot} = (0.117
\div 0.122)M_{\odot}$, and total angular momentum, $J^{tot} = (0.445 \div

numerical solution with our previous analytical solution in the form of
toroidal atmospheres (Imshennik and Manukovskii 2000). This comparison
indicates that they are identical if we take into account the more general and
complex equation of state with a nonzero temperature and self-gravitation
effects in the atmosphere. Our numerical calculations, first, prove the
stability of toroidal atmospheres on characteristic hydrodynamic time scales

UCMs to the cases of log g = 4.5 and 5.5. The dust column density relative to
the gas column density in the observable photosphere is larger at the higher
gravities, and molecular line intensity is generally smaller at the higher
gravities. The overall spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are f_{J} < f_{H} <
f_{K} in middle and late L dwarfs, f_{J} < f_{H} > f_{K} in early T dwarfs (L/T
transition objects), and finally f_{J} > f_{H} > f_{K} in middle and late T
dwarfs, where f_{J}, f_{H}, and f_{K} are the peak fluxes at J, H, and K bands,
respectively, in f_{nu} unit. This tendency is the opposite to what is expected
for the temperature effect, but can be accounted for as the effect of thin dust
clouds formed deep in the photosphere together with the effect of the gaseous
opacities including H_2 (CIA), H_2O, CH_4, and K I. Although the UCMs are
semi-empirical models based on a simple assumption that thin dust clouds form
in the region of T_{cr} < T < T_{cond} (T_{cr} = 1800K is an only empirical
parameter while T_{cond} about 2000K is fixed by the thermodynamical data), the
major observations including the overall SEDs as well as the strengths of the
major spectral features are consistently accounted for throughout L and T

have been imaged in the U- and B-bands using the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2

group of 40 stars with known spectral types and complete UBVI WFPC2 photometry.
Approximately three quarters of the sources show excess luminosity in the
U-band, that we attribute to mass accretion. The known correlation between the
U-band excess and the total accretion luminosity allows us to estimate the
accretion rates. Overall, mass accretion rates appear lower than those measured
by other authors in the Orion flanking fields or in Taurus-Auriga. Mass
accretion rates remain low even in the vicinity of the birth line of Palla &
Stahler, suggesting that in the core of the Trapezium cluster disk accretion
has been recently depressed by an external mechanism. We suggest that the UV
radiation generated by the Trapezium OB stars, responsible for the disk
evaporation, may also cause the drop of the mass accretion rate. In this
scenario, low-mass stars may terminate their pre-main sequence evolution with
masses lower than those they would have reached if disk accretion could have
proceeded undisturbed until the final disk consumption. In OB associations the
low-mass end of the Initial Mass Function may therefore be affected by the
rapid evolution of the most massive cluster's stars, causing a surplus
""accretion aborted"" very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and a deficit of
intermediate mass stars. This trend is in agreement with recent observations of
the IMF in the Trapezium cluster.

medium (ISM) in the 500 central pc of the Milky Way (hereafter Galactic center,
GC). We review the results of the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) observations
of a sample of GC molecular clouds located far from thermal radiocontinuum or
far-infrared sources. For the first time, we have been able to study in detail
the dust continuum spectra from 40 to 190 microns founding a warm (30-40 K)
dust component in addition to the well known 15-20 K component. Fine-structure
lines observations have revealed the presence of diffuse ionized gas associated
with the molecular clouds. The effective temperature of the ionizing radiation
is higher than 33000 K. ISO has also allow us to measure the fraction of warm
(~ 150 K) H2 in the GC clouds, which is on average of 30 %. The observations of
the warm (a few 100 K) neutral gas are compatible with a Photon Dominated
Region (PDR) scenario.

of this observation is Lx~10e29 erg/sec for sources associated with the

identify 6 X-ray sources with known objects and use ROSAT observations to show
that the brightest X-ray source is variable. Archival data from the Hubble

Based on the X-ray and optical properties of the identifications and the

cataclysmic variables, one X-ray source as a millisecond pulsar and 12 sources
as chromospherically active binaries. Comparison of M4 with 47 Tuc and NGC 6397

Milky Way by the RHESSI satellite calls for a reassessment of the production
sites of those nuclides. The observed gamma-ray line flux ratio is in agreement
with calculations of nucleosynthesis in massive stars, exploding as SNII
(Woosley and Weaver 1995); in the light of those results, this observation
would suggest then that SNII are the major sources of Al26 in the Milky Way,
since no other conceivable source produces substantial amounts of Fe60.
However, more recent theoretical studies find that SNII produce much higher
Fe60/Al26 ratios than previously thought and, therefore, they cannot be the
major Al26 sources in the Galaxy (otherwise Fe60 would be detected long ago,
with a line flux similar to the one of Al26). Wolf-Rayet stars, ejecting Al26
(but not Fe60) in their stellar winds, appear then as a most natural candidate.
We point out, however, that this scenario faces also an important difficulty.
Forthcoming results of ESA's INTEGRAL satellite, as well as consistent
calculations of nucleosynthesis in massive stars (including stars of initial
masses as high as 100 M_sun and metallicities up to 3 Z_sun), are required to
settle the issue.

the two line profile codes which are on general release in the XSPEC spectral
fitting package. These models generally give a very good description of the
relativistic smearing of the line for this range of radii. However, these
models have some limitations. In particular we show that the assumed form of
the {\em angular} emissivity law (limb darkening or brightening) can make
significant changes to the derived line profile where lightbending is
important. This is {\em always} the case for extreme Kerr spacetimes or high
inclination systems, where the observed line is produced from a very large
range of different emitted angles. In these situations the assumed angular
emissivity can affect the derived {\em radial} emissivity. The line profile is
not simply determined by the well defined (but numerically difficult) physical
effects of strong gravity, but is also dependent on the poorly known
astrophysics of the disc emission.

one of the most important ways to investigate the structure of crystal
surfaces. STM has helped achieve remarkable successes in surface science such
as finding the atomic structure of Si(111) and Si(001). For high-index Si
surfaces the information about the local density of states obtained by scanning
does not translate directly into knowledge about the positions of atoms at the
surface. A commonly accepted strategy for identifying the atomic structure is
to propose several possible models and analyze their corresponding {\em
simulated} STM images for a match with the experimental ones. However, the
number of good candidates for the lowest-energy structure is very large for
high-index surfaces, and heuristic approaches are not likely to cover all the
relevant structural models. In this article, we take the view that finding the
atomic structure of a surface is a problem of stochastic optimization, and we
address it as such. We design a general technique for predicting the
reconstruction of silicon surfaces with arbitrary orientation, which is based
on parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations combined with an exponential
cooling. The advantages of the method are illustrated using the Si(105) surface
as example, with two main results: (a) the correct single-step rebonded
structure [e.g., Fujikawa {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 176101 (2002)] is
obtained even when starting from the paired-dimer model [Mo {\em et al.}, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 65, 1020 (1990)] that was assumed to be correct for many years, and

Branch-entanglement is achievable when there are two twin processes, where the

frequency-entangled photon pairs out of the microcavity. In planar

where $f$ is a rapidly decreasing function on the identity component of $G_\R$.
Denote the complement of the dense orbit by $S_\C$, and put $S_\R=S_\C\cap

operator. Furthermore, if $G_\C$ is reductive, and $S_\C$ and $S_\R$ are
irreducible hypersurfaces, $\pi(f)$ corresponds, on each connected component of
$V_\R-S_\R$, to a totally characteristic pseudodifferential operator. We then
investigate the restriction of the Schwartz kernel of $\pi(f)$ to the diagonal.
It defines a distribution on $V_\R-S_\R$ given by some power $|p(m)|^s$ of a
relative invariant $p(m)$ of $(G_\C,\rho,V_\C)$ and, as a consequence of the
fundamental theorem of prehomogeneous vector spaces, its extension to $V_\R$,

investigate space charge effects and the dependence of the pion rejection
performance on the incident angle of the ionizing particle. The average pulse
height distributions in the drift chambers operated with the Xe,CO2(15%)
mixture provide quantitative information on the gas gain reduction due to space
charge accumulating during the drift of the primary ionization. Our results
demonstrate that the pion rejection performance of a TRD is better for tracks
which are not at normal incidence to the anode wires. We present detailed
simulations of detector signals, which reproduce the measurements and lend
strong support to our interpretation of the measurements in terms of space
charge effects.

  http://www.columbia.edu/itc/applied/wiggins/netclass/","BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:181 (22 November 2004)",,,"q-bio.MN",,"  Recent genomic and bioinformatic advances have motivated the development of
numerous random network models purporting to describe graphs of biological,
technological, and sociological origin. The success of a model has been
evaluated by how well it reproduces a few key features of the real-world data,
such as degree distributions, mean geodesic lengths, and clustering
coefficients. Often pairs of models can reproduce these features with
indistinguishable fidelity despite being generated by vastly different
mechanisms. In such cases, these few target features are insufficient to
distinguish which of the different models best describes real world networks of
interest; moreover, it is not clear a priori that any of the presently-existing
algorithms for network generation offers a predictive description of the
networks inspiring them. To derive discriminative classifiers, we construct a
mapping from the set of all graphs to a high-dimensional (in principle
infinite-dimensional) ``word space.'' This map defines an input space for
classification schemes which allow us for the first time to state unambiguously
which models are most descriptive of the networks they purport to describe. Our
training sets include networks generated from 17 models either drawn from the
literature or introduced in this work, source code for which is freely
available. We anticipate that this new approach to network analysis will be of
broad impact to a number of communities.

before, we study the dynamics of a number of mutant homodimeric and
heterodimeric kinesins that were constructed by Kaseda et al. (Kaseda, K.,
Higuchi, H. and Hirose, K. PNAS 99, 16058 (2002)). The theoretical results of
ATPase rate per head, moving velocity, and stall force of the motors show good
agreement with the experimental results by Kaseda et al.: The puzzling dynamic
behaviors of heterodimeric kinesin that consists of two distinct heads compared
with its parent homodimers can be easily explained by using independent ATPase
rates of the two heads in our model. We also study the collective kinetic
behaviors of kinesins in MT-gliding motility. The results explains well that
the average MT-gliding velocity is independent of the number of bound motors
and is equal to the moving velocity of a single kinesin relative to MT.

show the existence of a true Clifford code which is better than any stabilizer
code is a well known open problem in the theory of Clifford codes. One of the
main difficulties in solving this problem is that we know only about 110
examples of codes which are Clifford but not stabilizer codes. In this paper,
we obtain infinite examples of Clifford codes which are not stabilizer codes.
We expect our examples to be useful in the study of Clifford codes.

state is developed. This formulation can explain the results of both quantum
interference and delayed-choice experiments without making use of the
controversial wave-particle duality. Quantum particles are seen as localized
and indivisible concentrations of energy and/or mass, their probability
amplitude in phase space being described by the Wigner distribution function.
The wave or particle nature appears in experiments in which the interference
term of the Wigner distribution function is present or absent, respectively,
the filtering devices that modify the quantum wavefunction throughout the
set-up, from its generation to its final detection, being responsible for the
modification of the Wigner distribution function.

cancellation scheme providing squeezed vacuum states with coherent bright phase
modulation sidebands at higher frequencies. The system has been stably locked
